<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/spooktacular-apple-event-on-halloween-eve/">丹·莫伦，《六种颜色</a>》：</p><blockquote><p>将此视为我以前从未见过的事情：<em>晚上</em>的苹果活动。该公司周二宣布将于太平洋时间 10 月 30 日星期一下午 5 点举办“Scary Fast”活动。</p><p>正如<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">彭博社马克·古尔曼（Mark Gurman）本周末报道的</a>那样，人们普遍预计这次活动将推出新款 Mac：这笔钱似乎是在更新的 24 英寸 iMac 上，不过也可能会发布其他产品。</p></blockquote><p>在东部时间晚上 8 点/太平洋时间下午 5 点广播活动是一项新鲜事，但我们仍处于预先录制主题演讲时代的早期阶段。至少可以说，这很不寻常——让我想知道是否还有其他的事情可以让这个时机变得有意义。</p><p>如果是 iMac，升级到 M2 而不是 M3 我不会感到惊讶。 Gurman 报道称 iMac 将跳过 M2，直接转向 M3，但<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-26/apple-aapl-plans-iphone-14-apple-watch-series-8-m2-macs-for-2022-and-2023-l4vd5unx">该报道可以追溯到<em>2022 年</em>6 月</a>：</p><blockquote><p>除了 Mac 和 iPad Pro 之外，我预计 M2 还会出现在另一个地方：苹果的混合现实耳机。据我所知，该设备的最新内部版本运行基础 M2 芯片以及 16 GB 的 RAM。 [...]</p><p>苹果公司还已经在开发 M2 的继任者 M3，并且该公司计划最早在明年更新代号为 J513 的 13 英寸 MacBook Air 和 15 英寸 MacBook Air 时使用该芯片。 J515，一款代号为 J433 的新 iMac，可能还有一款仍处于早期开发阶段的 12 英寸笔记本电脑。</p></blockquote><p>他关于 Vision Pro 使用 M2 的说法是正确的 - 请记住，那是在它宣布之前整整一年 - 但我觉得 M3 芯片在 iMac 中首次亮相并不合适。 Gurman 还指出，MacBook Pro（无论是不那么“专业”的 13 英寸型号，还是真正专业的 14 英寸和 16 英寸型号）目前都供不应求，其中- 大多数配置的发货日期为 11 月。但感觉 M3 Pro/Max 芯片开始发货还为时过早，因为 A17 Pro（M3 可能基于该芯片）上个月才开始发货。鉴于我听说台积电的 3nm 生产能力——尤其是获得晶圆——我认为他们的手上已经忙着为 iPhone 15 Pro 生产 A17 Pro 芯片了。</p><p>所以我只是在这里猜测，但我认为这次活动可能只是关于 iMac，升级到 M2，也许还有一些设计变化——比如，比如新鲜的颜色。如果这是 M3 的首次亮相，那就更有趣了，但我的直觉告诉我，这还没有发生。</p><p><em>另外</em>：在售价 3,500 美元的 Vision Pro（配备 M2）之前几个月开始推出售价 1,300 美元的基于 M3 的 iMac（或售价 1,000 美元的 iPad Pro），感觉有点尴尬。对我来说，基于 M3 的 Mac 和 iPad 只会在 Vision Pro<em>之后</em>推出，这很自然，因此当 Vision Pro 发布时，M2 仍然是“当前”的苹果芯片一代。</p><p><em>但是</em>：这次活动的名字是“Scary Fast”，所以也许<em>是</em>关于M3系列的首次亮相？我仍然不认为他们会准备好 M3 Pro/Max 芯片，但也许它会为所有使用常规 M2 的 Mac（以及 iMac 的 M1）进行全面更新？</p><p>因此，看起来古尔曼将在“今年会推出新 Mac 吗？”这一问题上击败郭明池。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">雷霆穹顶的对决</a>，但有趣的是，似乎没有人知道到底会发生什么。</p><h2>后记</h2><p>好的，这是一个将所有拼图拼凑在一起的吐球想法：</p><ul><li>普通 24 英寸 iMac 升级至 M2。</li><li>这些新的 iMac 也可能是那些据称用于 iPhone 15<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">的颜色匹配的编织 USB-C 电缆</a>的来源。所有 iPhone 15 型号都配备纯白色编织电缆，但现有的 M1 iMac 配备有趣的颜色 -匹配的闪电电缆。</li><li>新款“pro”iMac 推出，配备 M2 Pro 和 M2 Max 芯片，与当前 14 英寸和 16 英寸 MacBook Pro（今年年初才推出）中的芯片相同。也许这些假设的 iMac Pro 也会有更大的显示屏？ 27 英寸可以匹配 Studio Display 和旧的基于英特尔的“大”iMac。</li></ul><p> M2 Pro 和 Max iMac 可以证明“快得吓人”，而普通的 M2 iMac 减速带则不然。这仍然允许 Vision Pro 在“明年初”推出，而 M2 仍然是当前的苹果芯片一代。这也与传闻中的台积电 3nm 产能在不久的将来几乎完全致力于满足 iPhone 15 Pro 的需求相吻合。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 苹果将于下周一晚上直播“Scary Fast”活动</title></entry><entry><title>iTunes 的终结？ </title><link href="https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/apple-is-finally-killing-off-itunes-for-real-this-time/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40305</id><published> 2023-10-24T17:33:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-24T17:33:41Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Kirk McElhearn 在 Mac 安全博客上写道：</p><blockquote><p>虽然有些人可能会一时兴起抛弃品牌积累的商誉，但苹果不喜欢这样做。即使在拆分 iTunes 应用程序之后，苹果仍保留了 iTunes Store 的名称来销售数字内容。您可以在Mac上的音乐应用程序中访问iTunes Store来购买音乐，iPhone和iPad仍然有iTunes Store应用程序。但有一些重叠之处：例如，你可以在 iTunes Store 和电视应用程序中购买和租借电影，因为苹果试图将购买转移到后者。</p><p>很快，iTunes 品牌就只剩下 iTunes Store 音乐了。人们过去购买的音乐要少得多，大部分都转向了流媒体。随着音乐销量的减少，iTunes 的名字最终会消失吗？很难想象苹果会完全停止数字音乐销售；即使购买数字音乐的人越来越少，市场也并没有消亡，至少也不会消亡。全球数字音乐销售额在 2012 年达到峰值，约为 44 亿美元，到 2021 年已降至 11 亿美元。虽然下降了约 75%，但苹果仍然通过销售数字音乐赚取了大量资金。</p></blockquote><p>几年来我一直在想同样的事情。我在 Apple TV 上购买/租借了所有电影和电视节目，其中未提及“iTunes”。 （在流媒体时代，我实际上只购买/租借电影——现在我看的电视节目都是流媒体的。）那么为什么要在 iOS 上保留 iTunes Store 应用程序呢——他们只需在音乐应用程序中添加一个“商店”选项卡即可。在音乐中购买音乐（如果您购买音乐），在电视中购买电影。</p><p>我认为不这样做的唯一原因是音乐应用程序已经如此拥挤。</p><div> <a  title="指向“iTunes 的终结？”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_and_ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3j" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40303</id><published> 2023-10-23T22:33:57Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T22:33:58Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">苹果内部的焦虑在于，内部许多人不相信苹果自己的 AI/ML 团队能够实现这一目标。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>我感谢 Kolide 上周对 Daring Fireball 的赞助。自 ChatGPT 推出以来的短短几个月内，市场上已经出现了数百种人工智能驱动的工具。但是，虽然基于人工智能的工具具有真正有用的应用程序，但它们也带来了严重的安全风险。不幸的是，大多数公司仍然没有拿出管理这些风险的政策。在缺乏关于负责任的人工智能使用的明确指导的情况下，员工会漫不经心地将敏感数据交给不值得信赖的工具。</p><p><a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">基于人工智能的浏览器扩展</a>最清楚地说明了这一现象。 Chrome 商店中充斥着（声称）利用 ChatGPT 执行各种任务的扩展：起草电子邮件、设计图形、转录会议<a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">和编写代码</a>。但这些工具至少容易面临三种类型的风险：恶意软件、数据治理和提示注入攻击。</p><p> Kolide 采用两部分方法来管理人工智能的使用：允许您<em>作为一个团队</em>起草人工智能政策，并使用 Kolide 阻止恶意工具。<a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">请访问 Kolide 的网站，</a>详细了解 Kolide 如何通过 Okta 强制公司遵守设备合规性。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“Kolide —”Okta 的设备信任”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>苹果谣言专家 Thunderdome </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40302</id><published> 2023-10-23T18:16:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T18:16:54Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

But the Magic Keyboard is a $300 peripheral. It&#39;s not a niche product but it&#39;s certainly not for everyone. iPads are fundamentally handheld tablets, and handheld, the iPad Air&#39;s Touch ID instead of Face ID is much less of a difference. I still decidedly prefer Face ID, though. Touch ID on the iPad Air makes it feel easy to unlock. Face ID on the iPad Pro makes it seems like it wasn&#39;t even locked in the first place.</p></blockquote><p> With iPhones, Face ID is now in every model they sell but the SE. That&#39;s how it ought to be for iPads too: in every one of them but the price-focused entry model. It&#39;s too good of a feature, and a key advantage for iPads when compared to MacBooks. <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎︎</a></p><p></li></p><p><li id="fn2-2023-10-18"></p><p> The one weird MacBook is the 13-inch MacBook Pro. From a purely logical perspective, I don&#39;t think Apple should even sell that device. The M2 MacBook Air is cheaper, lighter, and equally capable. Study <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Air-M2,MacBookPro-13-M2,MacBook-Pro-14-M2">Apple&#39;s tech spec comparison page for 13/14-inch MacBooks</a> and it&#39;s hard to find a reason to recommend the 13-inch MacBook Pro. But I do think it sells surprisingly well. My theory is that there&#39;s a segment of the market that would be served better by the MacBook Air but who believe that they need a “Pro” MacBook. The specs don&#39;t matter to them — it&#39;s the name. Or maybe there are a surprising number of Touch Bar fans out there? <a href="#fnr2-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎</a></p><p></li></p><p></ol></div></p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ There&#39;s a New Apple Pencil With a USB-C Port, and My Thoughts Turn to the Complexity of the Overall iPad Lineup </title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v39" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/10/kolide_--_device_trust_for_okt_5" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40293</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-10-18T22:06:08Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T22:06:08Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

These extensions play on users&#39; trust of the big tech platforms (“it can&#39;t be dangerous if Google lets it on the Chrome store!”) and they often appear to work, by hooking up to ChatGPT et al&#39;s APIs.</li><li> <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Companies including Apple and Verizon have banned their employees from using LLMs because these products rarely offer a guarantee that a user&#39;s inputs won&#39;t be used as training data.</li><li> <strong>Prompt Injection Attacks:</strong> In this little known but <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">potentially unsolvable attack</a> , hidden text on a webpage directs an AI tool to perform malicious actions–such as exfiltrate data and then delete the records.</li></ol><p> Up until now, most companies have been caught flat-footed by AI, but these risks are too serious to ignore.</p><p> At Kolide, we&#39;re taking a two-part approach to governing AI use.</p><ol><li> <strong>Draft AI policies as a team.</strong> We don&#39;t want to totally ban our team from using AI, we just want to use it safely. So our first step is meeting with representatives from multiple teams to figure out what they&#39;re getting out of AI-based tools, and how we can provide them with secure options that don&#39;t expose critical data or infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>Use Kolide to block malicious tools.</strong> Kolide lets IT and security teams write <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3PJW32Q">Checks that detect device compliance issues</a> , and we&#39;ve already started creating Checks for malicious (or dubious) AI-based tools.

<p>Notable results from Piper Sandler&#39;s survey of over 9,000 US teenagers:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p> 70% of teens have used Spotify over the last six months (up from 68%), with 46% of teens opting to subscribe/pay for Spotify (up from 44%)</p></li><li><p> TikTok improved slightly as the favorite social platform (38% share) by 80 bps vs. spring &#39;23. SNAP was No. 2 with 28% share, followed by Instagram (23%)</p></li><li><p> Teens spend 28.7% of daily video consumption on Netflix (-220 bps vs. spring &#39;23) and 29.1% on YouTube (+100 bps vs. spring &#39;23)</p></li><li><p> 87% of teens own an iPhone; 88% expect an iPhone to be their next phone; 34% own an Apple Watch</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> The iPhone&#39;s market share among US teenagers has been remarkably high for as long as I can remember such surveys. Years ago, though, there was a split between how many teens actually <em>had</em> an iPhone vs. how many wanted one for their next phone. Now those numbers are effectively even. I suspect this is the primary driving force in the iPhone&#39;s continuing market share growth in the US It&#39;s easy to think only short-term and believe that just about everyone who might ever get a phone already has one, but there are teenagers (and pre-teens) getting their first phone <em>every</em> day.</p><p> That teens spend slightly more time every day watching video on YouTube than on Netflix isn&#39;t surprising, at least if you&#39;ve observed any teens recently. But it&#39;s rather remarkable given how different their business models are. Netflix spends a veritable fortune on new original content and old library content. YouTube content is mostly uploaded from users and content creators <em>for free</em> .</p><p> I&#39;d be curious to know if there&#39;s a noticeable split between which devices teens use to watch video on different services. Like, maybe YouTube viewing skews more toward watching on their iPhones, but Netflix on bigger-screen devices like laptops and iPads? TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram are surely viewed almost entirely on their iPhones.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Piper Sandler’s Annual ‘Taking Stock With Teens’ Survey’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Log Is the “Pro” in iPhone 15 Pro&#39; </title><link href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v37" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40291</id><published> 2023-10-18T21:40:45Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T21:40:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> When a customer buys a new iPhone from an Apple retail store, the device sometimes comes with outdated software. For instance, the first iPhone 15 models out of the factory shipped with iOS 17, but iOS 17.0.1 was already available by the time the devices were available for purchase. Buying a new iPhone without the latest software isn&#39;t ideal, especially if there are some high-profile bugs. But that situation is about to change.</p><p> Apple is planning a new system for its retail stores that will update the software on iPhones prior to sale. The company has developed a proprietary pad-like device that the store can place boxes of iPhones on top of. That system can then wirelessly turn on the iPhone, update its software and then power it back down — all without the phone&#39;s packaging ever being opened. The company aims to begin rolling this out to its stores before the end of the year.</p></blockquote><p> Fascinating idea, but I have so many questions. What exactly is the trigger here? Something related to MagSafe? When the system is put into place, will it work with existing still-in-the-box iPhones or will it only work with <em>new</em> units, that ship from the factory running iOS 17.2 or whatever? Will the same system eventually come to other products, like iPads and Apple Watches? Maybe even Macs?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gurman: Apple Is Readying System to Apply Software Updates to Still-in-Box iPhones’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/gurman-inbox-software-update">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iMazing 3: Coming Soon </title><link href="https://imazing.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=imazing3beta&amp;coupon=FIREBALL-IMAZING3" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v35" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/15/imazing-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40289</id><published> 2023-10-15T22:23:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-15T22:23:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>David Pierce, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Eddy Cue, in a dark suit, peered down at the monitor in front of him. The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly malfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the tech was up and running — showing an image of three iPhones, each demonstrating a part of the phone&#39;s setup process. Cue squinted down at the screen.</p><p> “The resolution on this is terrible,” he said. “You should get a Mac.” That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, “If Apple would like to make a donation…” That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business.</p></blockquote><p> Genuinely funny, and genuinely an Eddy Cue moment.</p><blockquote><p> Meagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he would have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn&#39;t agree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he&#39;d never really considered that an option: “I always felt like it was in Google&#39;s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.” Cue also argued that the deal was about more than economics and that Apple never seriously considered switching to another provider or building its own search product. “Certainly there wasn&#39;t a valid alternative to Google at the time,” Cue said. He said there still isn&#39;t one.</p></blockquote><p> Here we get to the heart of the matter. Say what you will about alternatives like Bing and DuckDuckGo (which is powered by Bing results), but they are — I say — at least “valid” alternatives to Google for web search. I&#39;ve been using Kagi — <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/plan-types.html">a paid search engine with plans starting at $5/month</a> — for about a year and there&#39;s no question in my mind that I&#39;m getting as good or <em>better</em> results than I do from Google for the overwhelming majority of my searches. Apple <em>could</em> switch, quality-wise. Whether they could switch and maintain any semblance of the profits they reap from their deal with Google, I do not know.</p><p> So as Google&#39;s search result quality deteriorates — but their ability to monetize their search monopoly remains strong — Apple looks bad too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Eddy Cue in Court, Defending Apple’s Lucrative Search Deal With Google’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/12/cue-apple-google">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> President Biden on the Terrorist Attacks in Israel </title><link href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cho6JtMTYXg" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v33" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/11/biden-israel" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40287</id><published> 2023-10-11T17:59:47Z</published><updated> 2023-10-11T18:03:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>John Kelly, writing for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The ad was for a Whopper Jr. promotion. The conceit was that you could get two of the baby burgers for a mere $5: one for you and one for a friend. But — spoiler alert! — you&#39;d probably want to consume the pair yourself. Or, as the text on the screen put it:</p><p> JK YOU<br /> ATE &#39;EM<br /> BOTH</p><p> I grabbed my remote, rewound, paused and took a photo. This was the Zapruder film to me, even if the JK stood for “Just kidding,” not “John Kelly.”</p><p> This must not stand, or — to keep with the theme — it mustn&#39;t stand.</p></blockquote><p> This sort of mistake drives me nuts, and I spot such wrongly-curled apostrophes instantly. To me it&#39;s as glaring a mistake as a misspelled word. So god bless Kelly for griping about it in a column in The Washington Post. (I&#39;d argue that perhaps it&#39;s correct for Burger King to use the wrong apostrophe, as a signifier of the care with which they prepare their food.)</p><p> But Kelly doesn&#39;t mention the obvious explanation for how this happens: automatic smart quote algorithms that aren&#39;t smart enough, in the hands of ignorant designers who don&#39;t have an eye for typography. If you type:</p><pre> <code>&#39;em&#39; dashes and &#39;en&#39; dashes</code></pre><p> you want the apostrophe before <em>em</em> to be an opening single quote, the one shaped like a 6 in most typefaces. But if you type:</p><pre> <code>screw &#39;em</code></pre><p> you want the apostrophe preceding the <em>em</em> to be a closing single quote, the one shaped like a 9. The various “smart quotes” algorithms you get while typing aren&#39;t smart enough to make this contextual distinction — even <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">very good ones</a> — so you need to do it by hand.

<p>Dan Moren, also at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> That second agent proved quite capable, not only agreeing that the situation was strange, but also looking into issues on Apple&#39;s side. Which led to the somewhat bizarre conclusion of this story: after perhaps 20 minutes on the phone, he seemed to hit on something. I heard him laugh and say something along the lines of “that explains it” and then, with my consent, put me on hold. When he came back, he said — and I&#39;m not exactly quoting, but close enough: “I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t tell you any more than this, but all your services should be back up pretty much exactly 12 hours after they went down.” [...]</p><p> So I waited the rest of the day. At this point, I had received no email since the early morning, and a number of my other apps — though not all — were non-functional. It made me realize just how much of my life was dependent on Apple&#39;s online services — a somewhat sobering proposition.</p><p> I spent the next few hours largely offline, but kept an eye on the clock.

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> I recently went to a football game (it was a beautiful day in Berkeley, California) and was trying to figure out where my wife had gone — we were separately looking for concessions amid the rattle and hum of a busy stadium walkway. Then I remembered we both had new iPhone 15 models, and I opened Find My — the app that lets you find all that you can&#39;t leave behind — and enabled the remarkable new UWB-powered feature that lets you find nearby friends. Not only did I almost immediately discover that she was to my right (so I began heading that way), but she was also notified that I was looking for her. We found each other and had fun doing it!</p></blockquote><p> I neglected to mention this feature in my review, but I tested it, and it really did work as advertised. Almost freakishly accurate.</p><p> Snell wraps up his review with a good summary for how much new stuff you can expect to enjoy when upgrading from each successive year of Pro iPhones from the 11 onward.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell Reviews the iPhones 15 Pro’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/snell-iphones-15-pro">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40280</id><published> 2023-10-09T18:29:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-09T18:29:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it. The user chooses when to restart, but if they don&#39;t fix the problem by a predetermined deadline, they&#39;re unable to authenticate with Okta.</p><p> <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Watch Kolide&#39;s on-demand demo</a> to learn more about how it enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Snopes Shows the Folly of X&#39;s New Link Presentation </title><link href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/musk-biden-transgender-died/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/snopes-twitter" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40279</id><published> 2023-10-07T00:52:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T17:11:30Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Another change this week at Twitter/X: they&#39;ve stopped showing the headline for links in tweets. Jordan Liles, writing at Snopes under the splendid headline “Did Elon Musk Endorse Biden, Come Out as Transgender, and Die of Suicide?”:</p><blockquote><p> On Oct. 5, 2023, a user on X named Armand Domalewski posted that the social media platform&#39;s owner, Elon Musk, had announced his endorsement of US President Joe Biden for a second term in the White House. “Elon Musk endorses Joe Biden for re-election,” the post read alongside a picture of Musk smiling.</p><p> However, this news was not true. Domalewski had created the <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmandDoma/status/1709827419031691620">post</a> ( <a href="https://archive.ph/yIIJG">archived</a> ) as somewhat of a satirical example of a recent decision made by X that removes visible headlines from posts that contain links.</p><p> The link in the post, which was only displayed as “Fortune.com,” led to an <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/21/elon-musk-plans-remove-headlines-news-articles-link-shared-on-x-twitter/">article</a> with a headline that could only be read if users visited the website. That headline: “Elon Musk plans to remove headlines from news articles shared on X.”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693843680904216619">Musk&#39;s stated reason</a> for the change: “Will greatly improve the esthetics.”</p><p> This justification, as Liles&#39;s piece at Snopes exemplifies, is of course nonsense. Either show the full preview card, including the original site&#39;s headline, or don&#39;t show anything except the original URL. That&#39;s the way Twitter worked for years: the full URL itself was visible in the tweet. But Twitter is now showing neither the original headline nor the URL, just the domain name of the source, along with the URL&#39;s preview card <em>image</em> .</p><p> Clarity, in all things, is the height of aesthetic achievement. The best link presentation is the one that makes it the most clear where it will take you. What X is presenting today is obfuscating, not clarifying, and thus grotesque.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Snopes Shows the Folly of X’s New Link Presentation’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/snopes-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> X Rolls Out New &#39;Chumbox&#39; Ad Format — Post-Like Things That Can&#39;t Be Reported or Blocked </title><link href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-x-new-clickbait-ad-format" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/x-chumbox" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40278</id><published> 2023-10-07T00:33:11Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T00:33:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Speaking of Sebastiaan de With, Lux — makers of Halide — have a new app out:</p><blockquote><p> Orion is a small, fun app that helps you use your iPad as an external HDMI display for any camera, video game console, or even VHS. Just plug in one of the bajillion inexpensive adapters, and Orion handles the rest.</p></blockquote><p> More fun than what Orion does is how it does it: with flair and character. You even have to “unbox” it on first launch. It&#39;s genuinely perplexing to me how this just-for-the-sake-of-fun style of UI design has fallen so out of favor. Apple went flat and no-nonsense with iOS 7 all the way back in 2013, and the rest of the world went flat and no-nonsense ever since. That was an entire decade ago! Maybe it&#39;s just wishful thinking on my part, because I personally crave a return to depth and texture and whimsy in UI design, but the pendulum has to swing back toward skeuomorphism eventually. Orion is definitely a step back in the direction of that ethos.</p><p> (It&#39;s not all gimmickry either — Orion&#39;s CRT emulation modes should make retro video games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puksg4iD3RY">look much more like how they were originally intended to look</a> .)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Orion: Use an iPad as an External HDMI Display’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/orion">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sebastiaan de With&#39;s iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera Review </title><link href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-15-pro-max-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2q" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/sdw-iphone-15-pro-max" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40274</id><published> 2023-10-05T23:23:15Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T23:43:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sebastiaan de With:</p><blockquote><p> I will not quit until I have shown you an inordinate amount of comparisons between the main camera and its new, long 5× telephoto counterpart. Not because it&#39;s just fun to see how much it zooms, but also to show you how differently you have to look at the world around you. [...]</p><p> This has a funny psychological effect: once I shoot at 5× for a while, the Main lens feels... wider somehow. I&#39;ve had to double-check a few times if I am not accidentally shooting at 0.5×. I suspect that this is what led to Apple adding the 28- and 35mm “lenses” to the camera — once you are going between such extreme ranges, the change is just a bit jarring.</p><p> Is it a great lens?</p><p> It is, hands down, the sharpest telephoto lens Apple has ever shipped. “Of course!”, you could argue. “Why wouldn&#39;t it be? It&#39;s 2023 and technology gets better. Why wouldn&#39;t it be sharper than the last one?”</p><p> Well, it&#39;s a long lens. It is truly remarkable how nicely this new lens captures detail <em>despite that length</em> .</p></blockquote><p> Illustrated with dozens of terrific photos. I had a similar experience testing the 15 Pro Max&#39;s 5× lens: it requires an entirely different way of looking at the world. Consider my fingers crossed that this lens makes it way down to the regular-sized iPhone 16 Pro next year.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Sebastiaan de With’s iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera Review’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/sdw-iphone-15-pro-max">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Becca Farsace&#39;s iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera Review for the Verge </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/23899983/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-apple-full-frame" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/farsace-iphone-15-pro-max" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40275</id><published> 2023-10-05T23:20:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-05T23:45:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>One interesting sidenote from Farsace&#39;s review: She attempted to shoot <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832">4K/60 ProRes video</a> , recording directly to an external SSD over USB, but she inadvertently did so using a USB-C cable that doesn&#39;t support USB 3 data transfer speeds, so the footage was captured at a terribly low frame rate.

<p>The Verge, as usual, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup/">has a wonderful page summarizing everything announced or demoed at yesterday&#39;s Pixel event</a> , including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00uU6PdTjKE">a 15-minute summary video</a> . The Verge is so good at things like this, I dare describe them as indispensable.</p><p> At the highest level it&#39;s impossible not to draw a direct comparison to Apple&#39;s iPhone 15 event last month. The two companies announced the exact same slate of products:</p><ul><li> New flagship phones, both Pro and non-pro</li><li> New smartwatches</li><li> New wireless earbuds with AR noise filtering features</li></ul><p> New phones, new watches, new earbuds. The Apple and Google versions of these products are all direct competitors to each other. No normal person buys both an iPhone and a Pixel, or both an Apple Watch and Pixel Watch, or both AirPods Pro and Pixel Buds Pro. But it&#39;s more profound than that. Practically speaking, no one mixes and matches these products. Why would anyone? If you own an iPhone, it&#39;s hard to think of a single reason why you&#39;d try to pair it with a Pixel Watch or Pixel Buds. And if your phone is a Pixel, you <em>can&#39;t</em> even pair it with an Apple Watch.</p><p> As I wrote about Apple&#39;s event last month, these three product categories go together. They form an ecosystem of truly personal computing devices: the ones we take with us nearly everywhere, which work together in ways that just don&#39;t apply to other devices. There are zillions of people who own the Apple triumvirate — iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods — who use a PC laptop and something other than an Apple TV box for streaming. And there are surely plenty of Android users who use a MacBook. A Mac <em>can</em> be a great device for use in Google&#39;s overall ecosystem.</p><p> It&#39;s also impossible not to comment on just how much less interest there is in Google&#39;s Pixel ecosystem. Google&#39;s event garnered only a sliver of the attention Apple&#39;s did, and their devices, similarly, have only a fraction of the sales Apple&#39;s do. On the one hand I&#39;m tempted to say the difference is just commensurate with how much better at hardware Apple is than Google. But I think there&#39;s more to it than that. There&#39;s something ineffable about it. There are aspects of marketshare traction — in any market — that can&#39;t be explained by side-by-side product comparisons alone.</p><p> For a long time, Apple just couldn&#39;t regain traction in the PC market. Even after Mac OS X was released, even after the Jobs/Ive regime had restored both <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/04/the-mac-product-grid/">sense</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808948/imac-twenty-five-visual-history-apple-design-models">panache</a> to the hardware lineup, it seemed like the best Apple could do was tread water, marketshare-wise. But they kept at it. We remember the long-running “Get a Mac” ad campaign with Justin Long (“I&#39;m a Mac”) and John Hodgman (“and I&#39;m a PC”) not just because it was clever but because it really did coincide with a reversal of fortune for the Mac in the market. People really did start switching from Windows PCs. So great was Windows&#39;s market share that here we are 17 years after the start of that ad campaign and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/apples-mac-market-share-jumped-even-though-pc-sales-fell-for-the-sixth-consecutive-quarter.html">the Mac continues to grow</a> .</p><p> Are Google&#39;s Pixel devices — the phones especially — ever going to have such a moment? I just don&#39;t see it happening. Most tellingly, they don&#39;t even take much share of the US <em>Android</em> market, let alone the US smartphone market, let alone the worldwide phone market. Here&#39;s 9to5Google, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/28/google-pixel-us-q2-2023-shipments/">reporting back in July regarding a market share report from Counterpoint</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Through that, though, Apple actually managed to up its share of the overall US smartphone market in Q2 2023 by 10%. That takes the iPhone to a 55% share of overall shipments, with Android brands competing for the remaining 45%. Apple has had higher numbers prior, hitting 57% in Q4 of last year, but there&#39;s still a clear trend where Android is continuing to lose ground.</p><p> However, Google Pixel managed to be a bright spot throughout. Pixel shipments in the US grew by 48% year-over-year in Q2, the only major brand that managed to do so. That&#39;s still a mere 3% of shipments over the quarter, but that&#39;s also during a time where only a single Pixel device actually launched.</p></blockquote><p> 3 percent market share in the US — Pixel&#39;s best market — is a pretty dim “bright spot”. I don&#39;t know how anyone could compute this, other than anecdata observed in Mountain View cafeterias, but I&#39;d wager that more Google employees carry an iPhone than carry a Pixel. There was a trend on Threads last week where — inspired by Linda Yaccarino showing the world that she didn&#39;t have the X app on her iPhone&#39;s home screen — people were showing screenshots of their own home screens. It struck me, watching them scroll by, just how many people have multiple Google apps among their most-used iOS apps — Maps, Gmail, Chrome. That&#39;s a sign of strength for Google, as a company, but it&#39;s obviously a hindrance to getting iPhone users invested in Google&#39;s overall ecosystem to switch their phone to a Pixel. The best software from Google is available on all phones; the best from Apple is only available on iPhones. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-05"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-05">1</a></sup></p><p> Something is just missing from the Pixel&#39;s potential appeal, and I don&#39;t think it was announced yesterday. I really am glad that Google seemingly remains committed to its Pixel devices, but I just don&#39;t see the angle that&#39;s going to change their popularity. I suspect I could save this column and publish it a year from now instead of today, and barely change a word.</p><hr /><p> The most striking features Google announced yesterday were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup/">regarding AI-assisted photography</a> . “Magic Editor” lets you move and remove objects and people. “Best Take” is a feature I&#39;ve long wished for yet still feel uneasy about: if you snap multiple photos of a group of people, Best Take will choose the “best” face for each person from the group of images, merging them into a single, well, best take. For decades we&#39;ve all been able to do this manually using Photoshop and other image editors, and merging multiple image captures into a single resulting “photo” is how features like HDR work. But Google seems more willing to brush aside any ethical concerns about what exactly a <em>photograph</em> is. On Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/Cx-3qcLrQH8">Nilay Patel wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google is framing its new AI camera tools as making “memories” not photos which... run this to the end and it&#39;s just a camera designed to tell lies about what really happened. I don&#39;t know that any news organization can accept journalistic photos from a Pixel 8 at this point.</p></blockquote><p> The difference from something like HDR is that even if HDR is generating one image from multiple sensor readings, the purpose is to more accurately reflect what the photographer&#39;s eyes actually saw, from that vantage point, at that moment in time. Pixel phone photography is racing ahead to a world where images reflect moments that never actually were. Is the purpose of a camera to capture things as they were, or as they should have been?</p><p> Is that dishonest? Is all of digital photography headed in this direction, inevitably, and Google is just willing to blaze the trail that everyone else will soon enough follow?我不知道。 But it was the segment of yesterday&#39;s event that most struck me: technically impressive, but ethically blithe.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-05"><p> Try this on for an analogy: Google treats its entire Pixel portfolio like Apple treats Apple TV hardware.

<p>Richard Sandomir, The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Tim Wakefield, a right-handed knuckleball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox who in 2004 played a critical late-innings relief role in the team&#39;s winning its first World Series championship in 86 years, died on Sunday. He was 57.</p><p> The Red Sox announced his death in a statement, saying the cause was brain cancer. […] In 2010, near the end of his career, Wakefield won Major League Baseball&#39;s Roberto Clemente Award, which recognizes a player&#39;s community and charitable work.</p></blockquote><p> On the field, I held Wakefield in disdain the way I hold in disdain all Red Sox. He was on the mound for so many great moments in Red Sox history, and against the Yankees in particular. But the truth is I always liked him. It&#39;s hard <em>not</em> to like a knuckleballer, for some reason. But there was always something about Wakefield, something that said, “This guy is one of the good ones.” You could just hear it in the way his teammates — and opponents — spoke about him.

<p>On Tuesday, Ming-Chi Kuo published a short post under the headline “ <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/the-iphone-15-pro-series-overheating-issues-are-unrelated-to-tsmcs-advanced-3nm-node-iphone-15-5f354b1ab155">The iPhone 15 Pro Series Overheating Issues Are Unrelated to TSMC&#39;s Advanced 3nm Node</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> My survey indicates that the iPhone 15 Pro series overheating issues are unrelated to TSMC&#39;s advanced 3nm node. The primary cause is more likely the compromises made in the thermal system design to achieve a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency. It&#39;s expected that Apple will address this through software updates, but improvements may be limited unless Apple lowers processor performance. If Apple does not properly address this issue, it could negatively impact shipments over the product life cycle of the iPhone 15 Pro series.</p></blockquote><p> That was the whole post. The post clearly implies that iPhone 15 Pro models have a design flaw related to their titanium frame that leads to overheating, and that since the flaw is related to the hardware design, Apple will be forced to throttle the CPU and GPU, and thus sales of the 15 Pro models will suffer.</p><p> Kuo is very influential, and thus his report <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=aapl+price+sept+25+to+29+2023">drove Apple&#39;s stock price down noticeably</a> . Kuo&#39;s influence stems not from his intuition but from his sources, but that&#39;s the problem with an allegation like this one. Kuo&#39;s narrative gained enough traction that Apple has issued a statement, repeated in its entirety below:</p><blockquote><p> We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected. The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity. We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update. Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We&#39;re working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.</p></blockquote><p> Not only is the titanium frame of the iPhone 15 Pro models <em>not</em> an issue, cooling-wise, but Apple told me — and I have no reason to doubt — that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are <em>better</em> at heat dissipation than any previous iPhone that used a stainless steel frame (iPhone X, XS, and 11–14 Pro). There is absolutely nothing wrong — and in fact much that is good — with the heat dissipation of the titanium frame, and Apple has no plan to in any way throttle the A17&#39;s performance. They have bugs to fix in iOS 17, that is all.</p><p> It&#39;s long been true that iPhones sometimes get warm/hot during the first few days after setup (or complete restore): all sorts of large libraries (like Photos) get synced in the background, and all sorts of on-device processing takes place. There are also often performance-related bugs in the first release of the major new iOS version each fall — and per Apple&#39;s statement, this year is no exception.</p><p> As for the problematic third-party apps, one of them is Instagram, which has apparently just this week released a version fixing a bug that was so egregious that it was burning through iPhones&#39; battery life at a rate of 1 percent/minute just sitting idle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6X2ZIkYFsQ">YouTuber Faruk “iPhonedo” Korkmaz posted a video this week</a> showing the buggy version of Instagram heating two different iPhones to 100°F: one an iPhone 15 Pro, the other a year-old iPhone 14 Pro. Exact same overheating issue. (I question here why iOS allows any app to consume so many resources that it makes the device too hot to hold comfortably, but the bug was apparently Instagram&#39;s. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">Same too with Uber</a> . Real shocker that two apps made with a Frankensteinian mishmash of web and native UI toolkits would run amok, resource-wise.)</p><p> Ming-Chi Kuo obviously has some remarkable sources within Apple&#39;s Asian supply chain. But he&#39;s still sometimes <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">very wrong</a> . And — unlike Mark Gurman — Kuo&#39;s sources seemingly never come from within Apple itself. His post on this overheating issue is almost transparently a leak from TSMC — a sort of “ <em>Whatever is going on with the iPhone 15 Pro heat dissipation, it has nothing to do with our 3nm process</em> ”. Blaming it on the new titanium frame was just wild speculation on Kuo&#39;s part, and by all evidence is <em>completely wrong</em> .</p><p> If Kuo has any respect for accuracy or truth, as I&#39;m sure he does, he&#39;ll issue a full retraction.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ iPhone 15 OverheatGate Seems to Be a Nothingburger</title></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Gate Number Two&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/09/30/ep-386" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/01/the-talk-show-386" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40263</id><published> 2023-10-01T16:15:31Z</published><updated> 2023-10-01T16:15:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie, reporting for The Wall Street Journal under the not-at-all-clickbait-y headline “ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-modem-chip-failure-6fe33d19">Inside Apple&#39;s Spectacular Failure to Build a Key Part for Its New iPhones</a> ” ( <a href="https://apple.news/AWKJlHS4MSQW1QmNj7lMUeA">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The new iPhone models unveiled last week are missing a proprietary silicon chip that Apple had spent several years and billions of dollars trying to develop in time for the rollout. The 2018 marching orders from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to design and build a modem chip — a part that connects iPhones to wireless carriers — led to the hiring of thousands of engineers. The goal was to sever Apple&#39;s grudging dependence on Qualcomm, a longtime chip supplier that dominates the modem market.</p></blockquote><p> The above lede sets the stage correctly, and if anything, undersells the contention between Apple and Qualcomm. Qualcomm does dominate the modem chip market, but that might even be putting it too mildly — they&#39;re effectively the only game in town for good 5G cellular modem chips. And Apple&#39;s reliance upon Qualcomm for cellular modems is more than just begrudged — it is despised. Even if Apple and Qualcomm got along, Apple <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/">would have a problem</a> with its reliance upon a single company for a core technology. But Apple and Qualcomm do not get along, at all.</p><p> But everything that follows the above lede is dubious at best, and in parts, a nonsensical and rather transparent hit piece. It reads like it was fed to Tilley and Jie by Qualcomm, and they bought it hook, line, and sinker — despite obvious glaring problems.</p><blockquote><p> Apple had planned to have its modem chip ready to use in the new iPhone models. But tests late last year found the chip was too slow and prone to overheating. Its circuit board was so big it would take up half an iPhone, making it unusable.</p></blockquote><p> This simply makes no sense at all. It&#39;s an impossible scenario. It sounds like something from an anonymous troll on Twitter/X, not a report in The Wall Street Journal. But it <em>was</em> reported by the Journal, so let&#39;s ponder just how ridiculous this one paragraph is.</p><p> First, the timeline just doesn&#39;t add up. We&#39;re supposed to believe not just that Apple was only testing the feasibility of a modem chip for the iPhones 15 “late last year”, but also that the chip “was so big it would take up half an iPhone, making it unusable”. It&#39;s true that a modem chip that “takes up half an iPhone” would be unusable, but so why would such a chip even be <em>considered</em> for possible use in this year&#39;s phones? It could be the best-functioning 5G modem in the world — faster performance <em>and</em> more efficient — and it simply couldn&#39;t be used if it were that big. It&#39;s not even close. Look at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">the teardown from an iPhone 14</a> to see how small Qualcomm&#39;s X65 modem chipsets are.</p><p> It&#39;s certainly possible that “late last year” Apple tested a <em>prototype</em> for an Apple-designed cellular modem, and that prototype was large, performed slowly, and ran too hot. That&#39;s how component development works: functionality comes first in early large prototypes, miniaturization comes after. You don&#39;t have to be a systems engineer to see how that makes sense. Why waste time on miniaturization for a component that isn&#39;t known to work well enough? <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-21"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-21">1</a></sup></p><p> But there&#39;s no way they were testing such a thing for <em>this year’s</em> iPhones. The lead time on hardware is <em>years</em> not months. And because Apple needs to produce hundreds of millions of new iPhones each year, the lead time for iPhone hardware designs is longer, not shorter, than most products. Apple not only knows today the cellular modem that will be in next year&#39;s iPhone 16 models, they probably already have decided on the modems, along with just about everything else, for the iPhone 17 two years from now.</p><blockquote><p> Apple — which hasn&#39;t publicly acknowledged its modem project, much less its shortcomings — is estimated to have paid more than $7.2 billion to Qualcomm last year for the chips.</p></blockquote><p> Apple press release from 2019: “ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">Apple to Acquire the Majority of Intel&#39;s Smartphone Modem Business</a> .” I&#39;m not sure how they could acknowledge the project more clearly than that.</p><p> Back to the Journal:</p><blockquote><p> Engineering teams working on Apple&#39;s modem chip have been slowed by technical challenges, poor communication and managers split over the wisdom of trying to design the chips rather than buy them, these people said. Teams were siloed in separate groups across the US and abroad without a global leader. Some managers discouraged the airing of bad news from engineers about delays or setbacks, leading to unrealistic goals and blown deadlines.</p></blockquote><p> Here&#39;s where the Journal&#39;s story starts to smell like a planted narrative from Qualcomm. We can&#39;t know that Qualcomm is behind this, but we do know that Qualcomm threw shade at Apple&#39;s modem efforts with a press release about a renewed deal between the companies <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">the day before the iPhone announcement event</a> . How better to follow that up than a new story painting a picture of technical ineptitude and managerial chaos inside Apple&#39;s modem team, set to appear the day before the iPhones 15 hit customers&#39; hands? This narrative especially suits Qualcomm if they&#39;re concerned about their own engineering talent defecting.</p><blockquote><p> “Just because Apple builds the best silicon on the planet, it&#39;s ridiculous to think that they could also build a modem,” said former Apple wireless director Jaydeep Ranade, who left the company in 2018, the year the project began.</p></blockquote><p> The Journal&#39;s first named source is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaydeepranade/">former Apple employee</a> who admittedly left the company before they even began their own modem project, and his keen insight is that a company that is good at one thing might not be good at an altogether different thing.</p><blockquote><p> Apple isn&#39;t expected to produce a comparable chip until late 2025, people familiar with the matter said. There could be further delays, these people said, but the company believes it will eventually succeed.</p></blockquote><p> If Apple isn&#39;t expecting to produce a 5G modem chip comparable to Qualcomm&#39;s until “late 2025”, why would they have been testing a chip in 2022 hoping to put it in today&#39;s iPhone 15? A project that is not yet four years old suddenly slipped an additional four years behind schedule? The story refutes itself.</p><blockquote><p> Apple found that designing a microprocessor, essentially a tiny computer to run software, was easy by comparison. Modem chips, which transmit and receive wireless data, must comply with strict connectivity standards to serve wireless carriers around the world.</p><p> “These delays indicate Apple didn&#39;t anticipate the complexity of the effort,” said Serge Willenegger, a former longtime Qualcomm executive who left the company in 2018 and doesn&#39;t know the current state of the Apple chip. “Cellular is a monster.”</p></blockquote><p> The second named source is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serge-willenegger-bb06961/">a retired executive who spent his entire career at Qualcomm</a> , and whose keen insight is to emphasize that the field where Qualcomm is the undisputed industry leader is very difficult.</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s push to build more of the various semiconductors used in its products stretches back more than a decade. In 2010, the company began using its own processing chips in iPhones and iPads. The chips helped Apple outperform many of its Android rivals, which relied on chips from Qualcomm, Taiwan-based MediaTek and other makers.</p></blockquote><p> Apple silicon outperforms “many Android rivals”? Please do share the ones it does not outperform. But those A-series chips are “easy”.</p><blockquote><p> The company in 2020 began replacing processor chips from Intel, used for years in Mac computers, with a proprietary chip that allowed its laptops to run faster and generate less heat, improvements that helped <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chips-that-rebooted-the-mac-11650081649?mod=article_inline">boost flagging Mac sales</a> . The Apple chip also saved the company an estimated $75 to $150 on every computer.</p></blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s universally hailed M-series chips are certainly helping Mac sales, but it&#39;s wrong to say Mac sales were “flagging” on Intel. In fact, the final quarter of Mac sales <em>before</em> the debut of Apple silicon models — the third calendar quarter of 2020 — was, at the time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/29/aapl-q4-2020">the best sales quarter the Mac had ever had</a> . This, despite the fact that the Apple silicon transition had been announced in June that year at WWDC. The Mac was breaking all-time sales records <em>before</em> the switch.</p><blockquote><p> Apple code-named its modem chip project Sinope, after the nymph in Greek mythology who outsmarted Zeus. It began taking shape in 2018, following the directive of Cook, Srouji, and others for Apple to build its own wireless components, said Chris Deaver, a former Apple human-resources executive and co-founder of BraveCore consultants.</p></blockquote><p> Deaver, the third named source in the Journal report, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-deaver/details/experience/">worked at Apple in human resources from 2015-2019</a> , and co-authored an upcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Together-Design-Creativity-Co-Creation/dp/1265386676/?tag=df-amzn-20">whose pre-order description</a> reads, “From the thought leaders who helped Tim Cook transition Apple from &#39;thinking different&#39; to &#39;working different together&#39; — a timely guide that helps leaders be more creative and creatives be better leaders”. You will never guess the color palette of the book jacket. <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-21"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-21">2</a></sup></p><blockquote><p> Srouji flew to Munich to greet Apple&#39;s newly acquired Intel wireless employees in December 2019. He told a gathering that the modem-chip project would be a game changer for Apple, the next step in the company&#39;s evolution, said people who watched the meeting. He said the chip would distinguish Apple devices, as Apple&#39;s processors had done.</p><p> As Apple filled the project&#39;s ranks with Intel engineers and others hired from Qualcomm, company executives set a goal to have the modem chip ready for fall 2023. It soon became apparent to many of the wireless experts on the project that meeting the goal was impossible.</p></blockquote><p> So it was in 2019, not “late last year”, that Apple hoped for its own cellular modems to be suitable for the iPhones 15 this year. Again, this is all from the same WSJ report.</p><blockquote><p> Apple found that employing the brute force of thousands of engineers, a strategy successful for designing the computer brain of its smartphones and laptops, wasn&#39;t enough to quickly produce a superior modem chip.</p></blockquote><p> The implication here is that Apple silicon is designed by the proverbial infinite monkeys typing on infinite typewriters — in complete contradiction of Brooks&#39;s Law.</p><blockquote><p> Modem chips are trickier to make than processing chips because they must work seamlessly with 5G wireless networks, as well as the 2G, 3G and 4G networks used in countries around the world, each with its own technological quirks. Apple microprocessors run software programs designed solely for its iPhones and laptops.</p></blockquote><p> Again and again, this story emphasizes that SoC&#39;s — comprising CPUs, GPUs, neural processing units, and more — are easy, but cellular modems are uniquely difficult. The nonsensical spin in this paragraph is that cellular modems are made difficult by the variety of networks around the world, and Apple&#39;s CPUs are made easier by the fact that they need only execute software “designed solely for its iPhones and laptops”. Let&#39;s leave aside the fact that this clunky phrasing omits form factors like watches, tablets, and desktop computers, and instead consider that Apple silicon is so performant that, via Rosetta 2 translation (technology that I&#39;m sure was also easy to make), the <em>slowest</em> Apple silicon Mac ever made (an M1 MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/15/m1-chip-emulating-x86-benchmark/">runs software compiled for Intel processors faster than any Intel Mac Apple ever shipped</a> . Apple silicon not only doesn&#39;t exclusively run software “designed” for it, it runs software compiled for Intel chips better than Intel&#39;s own chips do.</p><blockquote><p> Apple executives who didn&#39;t have experience with wireless chips set tight timelines that weren&#39;t realistic, former project engineers said. Teams had to build prototype versions of the chips and certify they would work with the many wireless carriers worldwide, a time-consuming job.</p></blockquote><p> The second sentence here implies that Apple&#39;s modem project executives didn&#39;t expect that they&#39;d need to build prototypes or that worldwide carrier certification would be time-consuming — because I&#39;m sure Apple had no difficulty getting the iPhone certified across all supported carriers prior to the start of this project in 2019.</p><blockquote><p> Executives better understood the challenge after Apple tested its prototypes late last year. The results weren&#39;t good, according to people familiar with the tests. The chips were essentially three years behind Qualcomm&#39;s best modem chip. Using them threatened to make iPhone wireless speeds slower than its competitors.</p><p> The company scratched plans to use the chips in Apple&#39;s 2023 models, and the planned rollout was moved to 2024. Eventually, Apple executives realized the company wouldn&#39;t meet that goal either. Apple instead opened negotiations with Qualcomm to continue supplying the modem chips. Apple&#39;s licensing deal with Qualcomm expires in April 2025, though it can be extended for another two years.</p></blockquote><p> I cannot emphasize enough how goofy the idea is that “late last year” Apple was still hoping to use its own cellular modems in this year&#39;s iPhones.</p><p> Here&#39;s what the Journal is declaring a “spectacular failure”: High-end cellular modems are essential components that are very difficult to engineer, and Qualcomm owns the entire market. Apple bought Intel&#39;s second-tier modem business for $1 billion in 2019 and set an ambitious goal of producing its own modems that match or surpass Qualcomm&#39;s by 2023. They missed that best-case-scenario target and thus are still buying modems from Qualcomm and will continue to for at least the next year or two. Not only is this not a “spectacular failure”, not a word of it is news.</p><blockquote><p> Apple has the cash and the desire to keep pursuing its modem chip, according to people involved with the project. “Apple isn&#39;t going to give up,” said Edward Snyder, a managing director of Charter Equity Research and a wireless industry expert. “They hate Qualcomm&#39;s living guts.”</p></blockquote><p> Finally, a named source in this cursed story who said something accurate.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-21"><p> For example, consider this passage from a February report by Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/apple-watch-blood-glucose-monitor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-care-aapl">about Apple&#39;s progress to invent a blood glucose monitor for Apple Watch</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s system — more than 12 years in the making — is now considered to be at a proof-of-concept stage, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential. The company believes the technology is viable but needs to be shrunk down to a more practical size.</p><p> Engineers are working to develop a prototype device about the size of an iPhone that can be strapped to a person&#39;s bicep. That would be a significant reduction from an early version of the system that sat atop a table.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s how prototypes work. But no one is proposing, with a straight face, that an iPhone-sized blood glucose monitor might go in next year&#39;s Apple Watch. <a href="#fnr1-2023-09-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-09-21"><p> Deaver announced the book on LinkedIn a month ago, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095517841457631232/">one of the comments on his post reads</a> , “Thank you for the early peek into your book Chris 🙏🏽😊 It&#39;s very insightful 👏🏽👌🏽”.
