<p>在研究上<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad">一篇文章</a>的过程中，当时的《纽约时报》餐厅评论家咪咪·喜来登 (Mimi Sheraton) 于 1976 年陪桑德斯上校去曼哈顿的一家肯德基，我了解到她几个月前去世，享年 97 岁。这确实是一个开创性的职业生涯：</p><blockquote><p>喜来登女士是一位冒险家，热衷于另类体验，对食物有着不拘一格的品味，并且能够独立地抵抗餐馆老板和广告商的压力，她是第一位为《泰晤士报》评论餐厅的女性。她开创了乔装点评、戴着假发和有色眼镜就餐以及使用化名进行预订的先河，主要是在高端场所，否则人们会通过重复访问而认识她并对她倾注大量注意力。</p><p>她在 2004 年的回忆录《吃我的话：一生的胃口》中写道：“我对餐馆进行评论的时间越长，我就越相信，这位不知名的顾客与一位尊贵的顾客或一位公认的美食评论家相比，有着完全不同的体验。” ” “出于所有实际目的，他们还不如在不同的餐厅。”</p></blockquote><p>以我对餐饮业的了解，很难相信评论是<em>不</em>经过伪装的。常客（和公认的评论家）得到更好的服务和食物是再明显不过的了，这就是为什么<a href="https://kottke.org/13/09/on-the-regular">找到你最喜欢的地方并成为这些地方的常客是如此令人高兴</a>。</p><blockquote><p>同事和其他餐厅评论家形容她的评论严厉但公平，并且经过严格研究。 《纽约时报》要求在发表评论之前访问一家餐厅三次；她吃了六到八次才做出判断。在一篇有关熟食三明治的文章中，她在一天内收集了 104 个咸牛肉和熏牛肉样本，以评估肉类和三明治的制作技术。 [...]</p><p>她的另一篇评论基于几位《纽约时报》工作人员的盲品，她更喜欢自有品牌酒，而不是苏格兰威士忌、波本威士忌、黑麦、伏特加和杜松子酒等流行品牌。这篇评论是在圣诞节前几周进行的，圣诞节是酒类销售旺季。</p><p> “我听说价值 200 万美元的广告被取消了，”喜来登女士在她的回忆录中回忆道。她找到了执行主编。 “我问阿贝·罗森塔尔这是否属实。他说：‘这不关你的事。这是一个很棒的故事。”</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接“纪念纽约时报美食评论家咪咪·喜来登”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/remembering-mimi-sheraton">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “对于上校来说，这真是令人舔手指” </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzh" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40157</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:40:55Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T19:27:37Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MrBeast 对 MrBeast Burgers 的质量不满意让我想起了肯德基的创始人哈兰·桑德斯上校，他于 1964 年将公司卖给了一家企业集团，然后在余生中一直担任肯德基的付费代言人，尽管事实上他他鄙视他们的食物，并对卖掉连锁店表示深深的遗憾。 1976 年，《纽约时报》餐厅评论家咪咪·喜来登 (Mimi Sheraton) 陪着当时 86 岁的桑德斯去了曼哈顿市中心的一家肯德基：</p><blockquote><p>进入厨房后，上校走到一个装满炸鸡块的大桶前，宣布：“那太黑了。它应该是金棕色的。你要煎 12 分钟——这太长了 6 分钟。更重要的是，你的煎炸油应该在一周前就换掉。这是我见过的最难吃的炸鸡。让我看看你的肉汁土豆泥，你是怎么做的？”</p><p>当辛格尔顿先生解释说他首先将沸水混合到速溶土豆粉中时，上校打断了他。 “然后你就可以粘贴壁纸了，”他说。 “接下来假设你添加一些棕色肉汁，然后你就会得到污泥。” “没有人能让我吞下这些土豆，”他尝了一些后说道。 “还有这个凉拌卷心菜沙拉。这个凉拌卷心菜！他们就是不听我的。应该是切碎的，而不是切碎的，而且应该是用奇迹鞭制作的。其他任何东西都会变成灰色。除了卷心菜之外，里面应该什么也没有。没有胡萝卜！”</p><p>辛格尔顿先生回答说：“我只是按照吩咐去做，先生。”桑德斯上校随后温和地对目瞪口呆的经理说：“好吧，这不是你的错。你只是在为一家不知道自己在做什么的公司工作。”</p></blockquote><p>桑德斯当时代表该连锁店拍摄广告的年薪为 20 万美元。但他们要做什么——解雇他？我想知道今天有多少孩子意识到桑德斯是一个真正的人，他实际上创立了这家连锁店，而不是像麦当劳叔叔或伟大的披萨鉴赏家查克·E·奶酪那样虚构的吉祥物？</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“对于上校来说，这太糟糕了”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> MrBeast 被其虚拟汉堡连锁餐厅背后的公司起诉索赔 1 亿美元</title><link href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/mr-beast-sued-burger-company-100-million-1235689127/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzg" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/mrbeast-burger-suit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40156</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:05:58Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T18:26:37Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>伊丽莎白·瓦格迈斯特 (Elizabeth Wagmeister)，《综艺》报道：</p><blockquote><p>全球最大的 YouTube 明星吉米·唐纳森（又名 MrBeast）正被 Virtual Dining Concepts 起诉，这是一家经营他的虚拟连锁餐厅 MrBeast Burger 的幽灵厨房公司。 [...]</p><p>在唐纳森最初对 VDC 提起的诉讼中，他指责该公司食品质量差，并表示大多数 MrBeast Burger 虚拟餐厅都受到了粉丝的负面烹饪评论，他们“对 MrBeast 将自己的名字印在这款产品上感到非常失望”。诉讼称，VDC“对 MrBeast 品牌和 MrBeast 声誉造成了重大、不可挽回的损害”，并声称虽然该业务赚了数百万美元，但他“没有收到一毛钱”。作为回应，上周，VDC 声称这位 YouTube 明星的品牌“呈指数级”增长，部分原因是“MrBeast Burger 品牌本身”。</p></blockquote><p>唐纳森品牌因汉堡品牌而发展的说法似乎似是而非。但也许我与快餐的最新趋势脱节了——直到最近我才听说过 MrBeast Burger，但事实证明他们到处都有“<a href="https://www.mrbeastburger.com/about">幽灵厨房</a>”，包括在费城。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“MrBeast 被其虚拟汉堡连锁餐厅背后的公司起诉索赔 1 亿美元”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/mrbeast-burger-suit">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>洋基体育场无人机飞越</title><link href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cvs1k8NAfWH/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzf" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/yankee-stadium" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40155</id><published> 2023-08-09T17:26:48Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T17:26:48Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

href="https://friendly.io/insights/privacy/">Friends 的隐私政策</a>声明他们是“Sensor Tower Inc. 的附属公司”。友好社交浏览器是一款带有内置书签的网络浏览器，适用于 Facebook、Twitter 和 Instagram 等网站。友好的流媒体浏览器是一款 Mac 应用程序，它只是一个网络浏览器，带有 YouTube 和主要流媒体网站的内置书签。 （不知何故，友好的流媒体浏览器被苹果认为配得上<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1655204439">这个应用程序商店的专题故事</a>。）<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-shopping-browser/id6443906359">友好的购物浏览器</a>，你猜对了，是一个带有内置书签的网络浏览器，适用于亚马逊、沃尔玛、好市多和塔吉特等购物网站。 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-shopping-insights/id6444090373">Friendly Shopping Insights</a>是一款专门针对亚马逊的应用程序——您使用亚马逊凭证登录，它会向您显示您的消费历史和习惯。我认为，基本上，这是一个应用程序，可以让 Sensor Tower 查看您在亚马逊购买或查看的所有内容以及您的购买历史记录。我说“我认为”是因为我在安装它后实际上并没有登录我的亚马逊帐户。我不知道为什么有人会使用这些应用程序。</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.stayfocusd.com/">StayFocused</a> ——“Google Chrome 的生产力扩展程序，通过限制您在浪费时间的网站上花费的时间来帮助您专注于工作。”</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://adblockluna.com/">Adblock Luna</a> — Adblock Luna 是一款专门用于广告拦截的 VPN。当 VPN 安装并处于活动状态时，所有网络流量都通过 VPN 进行隧道传输。您的 VPN 提供商可以查看（从而跟踪）您在互联网上所做的<em>一切</em>，无论是通过浏览器（包括私人/隐身标签）还是应用程序。 Sensor Tower 声称“已有超过 1500 万用户安装了 Luna”。这些用户是 Sensor Tower 极其丰富的信息来源。</p><p> Adblock Luna<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensortower.luna">位于 Google 的 Play 商店中</a>，但是当您点击 Luna 网站上的“Install for Android”按钮时，它们不会链接到 Play 商店，而是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/08/adblock-luna-android-install.png">显示此弹出窗口</a>，指示您 (1) 启用 Android 设置以允许应用程序从未知来源安装（又名侧面加载）；然后 (2) 安装刚刚下载到您设备的 .apk 应用程序包。我不知道为什么他们引导用户侧载而不是 Play 商店中的 Adblock Luna 版本，但对我来说这是一个危险信号。</p><p> Adblock Luna 不在 Apple 的 App Store 中。对于 iOS 设备，它们会将您引导<a href="https://adblockluna.com/install">至此页面</a>。首先，他们要求您输入出生年份以“证明”您已年满 18 岁。然后您下载 VPN 配置文件，他们将引导您完成“设置”中的步骤以启用其根信任证书。很明显为什么它不在 App Store 中。这与在 iOS 上安装第三方系统软件差不多。</p></li></ul><hr /><p>因此，我看到 Sensor Tower 收集不属于自己的应用程序和网站的使用信息的三种方式：(1) 广告拦截 Web 浏览器扩展，(2) 适用于 Android 和 iOS 的屏幕时间监控应用程序，在 iOS 上需要访问权限屏幕时间，以及 (3) Adblock Luna VPN。 （也许我低估了他们可以从玩 Melody Run 的用户那里收集多少数据。）</p><p>这些应用程序可能很受欢迎——他们再次声称 Adblock Luna 已经被超过 1500 万用户安装——但他们从这些应用程序中收集的数据能代表普通公众吗？ ActionDash 和 StayFree 的广告对象是那些希望“戒除手机成瘾”的人。从这些应用程序收集的数据对于这些用户来说可能是准确的，但自认为对其设备有“成瘾”的用户是否代表典型用户？这似乎有点像试图通过对自称酗酒者进行民意调查来收集饮料消费统计数据——无论是那些积极与毒瘾作斗争的人，还是那些成功戒毒的人，我都认为不太可能代表公众。</p><p>这些应用程序的用户群必须主要由技术上天真的、不知情的用户组成。 （另外：小气鬼，因为 Sensor Tower 的工具是免费的。毫不夸张地说，他们的用户就是他们的产品。）iOS 和 Android 都有内置的屏幕时间监控功能，iOS 上有<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982">屏幕时间</a>，Android 上<a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en">有数字健康</a>。两者都允许您跟踪使用情况并设置限制。如果安装 ActionDash 或 StayFree 而不是使用内置系统功能有什么好处的话，我不知道它是什么。当然，广告拦截非常流行，但使用 VPN 而不是网络浏览器扩展来拦截广告就像使用电锯从玉米棒中取出玉米粒一样 — 不仅杀伤力过大，而且很危险。它不在 iOS 应用商店中，也是 Sensor Tower 引导 Android 用户使用不在 Play 商店中的自托管版本的原因。</p><p>绝大多数公众甚至不会考虑安装第三方屏幕时间监视器。据大多数估计，只有<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+percentage+of+people+use+ad+blockers">40% 的人使用广告拦截器</a>。任何寻求屏幕时间监控和控制的人都应该使用其设备上的内置功能。我很难相信真正了解 VPN 本质的人在寻找广告拦截工具时会选择使用数据分析公司的免费 VPN。但这些人是 Sensor Tower 跟踪的互联网使用情况的人，因此主流新闻媒体通过 Sensor Tower 的声明<sup id="fnr2-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-05">2</a></sup>盲目地引用这些人作为整个世界的代表。</p><p> Adblock Luna 的安装说明对于非技术外行来说无疑是可怕的，对于任何足以了解 VPN 工作原理的专家来说，它们都是彻头彻尾的可怕。那么还剩下谁呢？无知却厚颜无耻。也许这些人的网络和应用程序使用情况确实代表了广大公众。但没有办法知道。例如，我们可以通过将政治民意调查机构的数据与选举的实际结果进行比较来判断其准确性。对于 Sensor Tower 及其同类发布的使用数据，没有这样的计算。这一切都无法证实，但从未被报道过。新闻媒体非常想了解使用数据，以至于他们只接受 Sensor Tower 和其他此类公司的表面声明，而没有描述（更不用说质疑）他们表面上如何知道他们声称了解的非常私人数据的内容。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-05">3</a></sup></p><p>让我怀疑。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-05"><p> Play 商店中有一条 2 星评论，开头是：“我给了 2 个原因：你把你的名字改成了旋律运行，而它应该是旋律运行。我无法访问关卡编辑器！”所以我想这可以解释为什么 Sensor Tower 的网站声称游戏的名称是“Melodies Run”——这实际上<a href="https://melodiesrun.apppage.net/">曾经是这个名称</a>。至少有一名用户对名称更改为

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686828350289887232">Elon Musk, on Twitter/X</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting. People from every corner of the world post incredible content on X, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred dollars a month changes their life.</p><p> While we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%. First 12 months is still free for all.</p><p> Apple does take 30%, but I will speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook">@tim_cook</a> and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30% of what X keeps in order to maximize what creators receive.</p></blockquote><p> A couple of thoughts on this. First, it strikes me as exceedingly unlikely that Apple is going to carve out any sort of exception for X Corp. And even if Apple <em>were</em> to carve out an exception for Twitter creator subscriptions, it certainly wouldn&#39;t be to only take 30 percent of what X Corp keeps from these subscriptions, especially given these — admittedly creator-friendly — terms.</p><p> Second, even if Apple were in the habit of carving out case-by-case exceptions to their in-app-purchase revenue split terms — and they&#39;re not — why in the world would they grant such an exception to X Corp, when Musk&#39;s oft-stated goal is to grow the platform into an “everything app” that encompasses chat, shopping, banking, entertainment, publishing, ride-hailing, and more. Gaming, of course, would be an area near and dear to Apple&#39;s financial interests. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">As I wrote about this “everything app” pipe dream last October</a> , the exemplars in Asia — WeChat in China, Line in Japan, etc. — are best thought of not as <em>apps</em> but as <em>platforms</em> , and we already have platforms that encompass everything: iOS and Android. This is why Apple (and Google) feel fully justified in taking their cuts of digital-goods transactions on their platforms — they&#39;re the ones who built the platforms that enable this commerce. If Musk were to succeed in building X into an “everything app”, it would implicitly mean usurping the role iOS and Android play today as the everything platforms. Why would Apple help X Corp get started down that path by agreeing to let them conduct reduced-fee — let alone no-fee — transactions?</p><p> Third, it&#39;s striking to me that Musk only mentions Apple and Tim Cook. Not a word about Android. One factor is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738370/google-play-cut-music-streaming-apps-10-percent-regulation">Google dropped the Play Store&#39;s revenue split for content subscriptions to 85/15</a> two years ago. I think Apple should drop their entire App Store fee structure to a flat 85/15, for purchases and subscriptions alike, for everything <em>other</em> than gaming (which is both where the money is and where a 70/30 split remains commensurate with the rest of the industry). But still, Google is charging 15 percent on every Twitter/X creator subscription made using the Android app. I suspect they&#39;re escaping Musk&#39;s attention simply because people on Android spend so much less money than people on iOS.</p><p> Last, Musk doesn&#39;t mention that these creator subscriptions can be made on X Corp&#39;s website (twitter.com). Why not just pull the in-app subscriptions from X&#39;s iPhone app and steer all purchases to the web? Probably because people are far less likely to subscribe over the web — which makes Apple&#39;s case for them that they&#39;re entitled to a hefty cut for having built a platform where people are so willing to buy and subscribe to things.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Oh to Be a Fly on the Wall During the Conversation Where Elon Musk Asks Tim Cook to Help X Corp Replace iOS as the Bedrock Everything Platform</title></entry><entry><title> Apple Q3 2023 Results </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-results" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40146</id><published> 2023-08-04T00:28:18Z</published><updated> 2023-08-04T00:28:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> Apple announced its results for its fiscal third quarter on Thursday. As expected, it was a down quarter — though at a 1% drop over the year-ago quarter, it&#39;s a better result than the previous quarter, which was down 3% year-over-year. The company reported $81.8B in revenue and $19.9B in profit.</p><p> The three key hardware categories were all down year-over-year: Mac was down 7%, iPad was down 20%, and the all-important iPhone was down 2%. Things were a little different in the two portions of Apple&#39;s business that have shown indefatigable growth in recent years: Services revenue was up 8% and the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category was up 2%.</p><p> In <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">a press release accompanying the results</a> , Apple CFO Luca Maestri trumpeted that it has broken the billion paid subscriptions barrier.</p></blockquote><p> No big surprises. Still lots of switchers coming to iPhone and Mac, and a lot of first-time iPad buyers.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Today, Apple announced that Apple Card&#39;s high-yield Savings account offered by Goldman Sachs has reached over $10 billion in deposits from users since launching in April. Savings enables Apple Card users to grow their Daily Cash rewards with a Savings account from Goldman Sachs, which offers a high-yield APY of 4.15 percent.</p></blockquote><p> Last week, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-the-partnership-between-apple-and-goldman-soured?rc=jfy0lk">in The Information</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As of earlier this year, the Apple Card had roughly 10 million users, according to a person with direct knowledge of the figure, which hasn&#39;t been previously reported.</p></blockquote><p> That works out to a nice even $1,000 average per Apple Card user. I&#39;m guessing though, that the <em>median</em> is much lower, and the mean average is $1,000 because a smaller number of users have transferred large amounts to take advantage of the 4.15 percent interest rate.

<p>Leaker ShrimpApplePro, on Twitter/X: <sup>*</sup></p><blockquote><p> Apple Watch Ultra 2. Same design. And I can confirm this year we will have the black titanium this year along with the current standard titanium.</p></blockquote><p> Yours truly, reviewing the Apple Watch Ultra last year:</p><blockquote><p> I don&#39;t own the silver link bracelet to try it, but I suspect it <em>doesn&#39;t</em> play paired with the Ultra. Brushed stainless steel and titanium are too different to be considered a match, but too similar to have deliberate contrast. I wish Apple were committed enough to the Link Bracelet to make a new one in titanium to match the case of the Ultra. (I also hope that future generations of Apple Watch Ultra are available with a space gray or black coating.)</p></blockquote><p> The last Apple Watch I bought for myself was a Series 7 in space black titanium. Given that the original Ultra was a hit, it seems like a no-brainer to offer it in a dark option this year. I think the biggest logistical complication for Apple with this is that it will multiply <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands/apple-watch-ultra-49mm">the number of Ultra straps they need to offer</a> — the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands have titanium fixtures that ought to match the watch case, and ideally, they&#39;d color match the buckle hardware on the elastomer Ocean Bands too. But there&#39;s a reason they put the COO in charge of Apple Watch.</p><p> One question I have: is the Action button going to remain orange, or is that color going to change each year? I&#39;m hoping it stays orange. (The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">orange hints on Vision Pro&#39;s head strap</a> suggest the color is more than a seasonal fad.)</p><p> ( <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/">Via MacRumors</a> .)</p><p> <small>* I&#39;ll drop the “Twitter” when twitter.com starts redirecting to x.com, and not the other way around. Even with the slapdash way they&#39;ve enacted this name change, you&#39;d think that would&#39;ve happened by now.

<p>Upstart web browser Arc, which remains exclusive to the Mac <a href="https://arc.net/">for now</a> , is out of beta. I find Arc hard to explain in a nutshell, and personally, it&#39;s not for me. But I&#39;ve got some friends who really dig it, and I can see why. It&#39;s a rethinking of how a web browser should look and work. It&#39;s less like a traditional browser and more like a virtual environment/platform unto itself, where tabs are more like apps inside a parent Arc window.</p><p> The reason it doesn&#39;t resonate with me is that I&#39;m both deeply accustomed to <em>and really like</em> Safari. But if you find yourself dissatisfied with Safari and other traditional browsers like Chrome, you should definitely give Arc a look. It&#39;s clever and ambitious.

<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch last week:</p><blockquote><p> With today&#39;s launch of Flighty 3.0, users will have a new way of sharing their flight information with trusted others, without having to rely on forwarding airline confirmation emails or sending texts.</p><p> Instead, Flighty is introducing the concept of “Flighty Friends,” a way to track loved ones&#39; flight details automatically. The concept builds on the friends&#39; flights feature already available in previous versions of Flighty, which allowed users to share their live flight information with others through the app.</p><p> Now, users can connect directly with one another in Flighty — similar to how you would “friend” someone on a social network. Afterward, the connected users would receive updates about their family members&#39; or friends&#39; flights on an ongoing basis. The app&#39;s notifications would then read something like “mom has landed,” instead of just noting a flight number has landed, and would include the user&#39;s profile photo.</p></blockquote><p> Terrific update to one of my very favorite iOS apps. We don&#39;t fly a ton, but my family flies often enough that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1358823008">Flighty</a> &#39;s $89/year family plan feels like a bargain. It&#39;s just $49/year for a single-user account. Everything about Flighty is just so nice, and so convenient. Its Live Activities widget is so well done that Apple featured Flighty in the WWDC keynote, and gave it an Apple Design Award this year.</p><p> Last year I had a flight get cancelled about an hour before it was supposed to start boarding. I got an alert from Flighty, immediately dashed over to the nearest gate agent, and got rebooked on another flight <em>before</em> American Airlines notified me that the original flight had been cancelled.</p><p> Back in January <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/meanwhile_over_in_androidtown" title="Daring Fireball: Meanwhile, Over in Androidtown">I wrote about the vast discrepancy between best-of-breed apps on iOS compared to Android</a> , using Mastodon clients as an example. Flighty is another such exemplar. It&#39;s exclusive to iOS and MacOS, and there&#39;s simply nothing close to it on Android. Flighty&#39;s free mode is quite useful too, and you get access to Flighty Pro free of charge for your first flight.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/news/travel/flighty-app-friends-flights/">Gunnar Olson writing for Thrifty Traveler</a> , and<br /> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-fly-without-these-five-travel-apps-b17b0755">Dawn Gilbertson writing for the WSJ</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Flighty 3.0’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/flighty-3">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Donald Trump Indicted Over Efforts to Overturn 2020 Election </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/01/us/trump-indictment-jan-6" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz1" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/01/trump-indicted-jan-6" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40141</id><published> 2023-08-01T21:53:24Z</published><updated> 2023-08-01T22:02:28Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Former President Donald J. Trump was indicted on Tuesday in connection with his widespread efforts to overturn the 2020 election following a sprawling federal investigation into his attempts to cling to power after losing the presidency to Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p> The indictment was filed by the special counsel Jack Smith in Federal District Court in Washington. It accuses Mr. Trump of three conspiracies: one to defraud the United States, a second to obstruct an official government proceeding and a third to deprive people of civil rights provided by federal law or the Constitution.</p></blockquote><p> Can you even believe it? Well, other than the fact that we watched him do all of this live on television, repeatedly over the course of his final months in office, can you believe it? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/01/us/trump-jan-6-indictment-2020-election.html">Read the full indictment here</a> . It opens thus:</p><blockquote><p> The Defendant, DONALD J. TRUMP, was the forty-fifth President of the United States and a candidate for re-election in 2020. The Defendant lost the 2020 presidential election.</p></blockquote><p> The indictment, poetically, is 45 pages long.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Donald Trump Indicted Over Efforts to Overturn 2020 Election’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/01/trump-indicted-jan-6">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Reed Jobs Starts VC Fund Focused on Cancer Treatments </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/business/dealbook/steve-jobs-son-venture.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz0" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/01/reed-jobs-yosemite" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40140</id><published> 2023-08-01T19:22:35Z</published><updated> 2023-08-01T19:22:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>DealBook at The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Reed Jobs is stepping into the spotlight: The 31-year-old son of Steve Jobs and Laurene Powell Jobs is starting a venture capital firm to invest in new cancer treatments, DealBook is the first to report. It&#39;s an area that hits close to home, since his father, the iconic Apple co-founder, died from complications of pancreatic cancer in 2011.</p><p> “My father got diagnosed with cancer when I was 12,” Mr. Jobs told DealBook&#39;s Andrew Ross Sorkin in his first interview with a news organization.

This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications.

<p>Katie Paul and Sheila Dang, reporting for Reuters, “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/meta-plans-retention-hooks-threads-more-than-half-users-leave-app-2023-07-28/">Meta Plans Retention &#39;Hooks&#39; for Threads as More Than Half of Users Leave App</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Meta Platforms executives are heavily focused on boosting retention on their new Twitter rival Threads, after the app lost more than half of its users in the weeks following its buzzy launch, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday. Retention of users on the text-based app was better than executives had expected, though it was “not perfect,” said Zuckerberg, speaking at an internal company town hall, the audio of which was heard by Reuters.</p><p> “Obviously, if you have more than 100 million people sign up, ideally it would be awesome if all of them or even half of them stuck around. We&#39;re not there yet,” he said. Zuckerberg said he considered the drop-off “normal” and expected retention to grow as the company adds more features to the app, including a desktop version and search functionality.</p></blockquote><p> Of course there was going to be a drop-off in usage after the initial influx. When brick-and-mortar stores and restaurants have successful grand openings, no one expects that opening traffic not to drop off. By <em>all</em> accounts, Threads has tens of millions of daily users despite being brand new and not yet offering a web interface.</p><p> [ <strong>Sidenote:</strong> It is a bit depressing that among normal people, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/CvAkXe3LOpc/">web apps are equated with “desktop”</a> . But it&#39;s not surprising. People want to use Threads from their desktop computers, and to them, that means typing “threads.net” in their web browser.]</p><p> But this narrative that Threads is a bust <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230727/p38#a230727p38">took hold over the weekend</a> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/zuck-says-threads-doing-better-than-expected-despite-losing-over-half-of-users/">Ars Technica</a> : “Most of the 100 Million People Who Signed Up for Threads Stopped Using It”</li><li> <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/28/elon-musk-touts-record-number-of-x-users-as-threads-stumbles/">The New York Post</a> : “Elon Musk Touts Record Number of X Users as Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Threads Stumbles”</li><li> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-lost-more-than-half-its-users-mark-zuckerberg-says-2023-7?op=1">Insider</a> : “Over Half the People Who Signed Up for Threads Have Stopped Using It Already, Prompting Mark Zuckerberg to Push for &#39;Hooks&#39; to Entice Users, Report Says”</li></ul><p> Dare Obasanjo, writing on Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@carnage4life/post/CvTYp1AJ00Z/">retorted perfectly</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The idea that an app that is clearly an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) doesn&#39;t have 100 million active users is a failure is the sort of addle brained thinking that the tech media has saddled us with.</p><p> The tech press can only write 3 stories:</p><ul><li> This company is a success</li><li> This company is a failure</li><li> Look how much funding this company got</li></ul></blockquote><p> Arguably, “look how much funding this company got” stories are just variations on the first two, depending on the sum of the funding.</p><p> A retention rate of 40-50 percent for a new app is excellent. I see no reason to doubt Zuckerberg&#39;s claim that Threads&#39;s retention is higher than they expected. All you need to do is <em>use</em> Threads to see that it&#39;s thriving. Is it on a path to long-term success? I don&#39;t see how anyone could say that so early, but it sure seems more likely than not. And we haven&#39;t even yet mentioned the fact that Threads is not yet available in the entire EU.</p><p> One interesting data point comes from Google&#39;s Play Store, where the top free apps in the “Social” category look like this, as I write at 8pm ET:</p><ol><li>抖音</li><li>Instagram</li><li> Facebook</li><li>线程数</li><li>X</li><li> Reddit</li><li> Facebook Lite</li><li> Bigo Live</li><li> Text Free</li><li> Plenty of Fish Dating App</li></ol><p> Earlier this evening, that same list had apps 4–7 — Threads, X, Reddit, and Facebook Lite — in a different order. I take this to mean that the first 3 are the big 3, and the next 4 are close to each other in a second tier. And then there&#39;s a dropoff to weird apps.</p><p> The “social networking” category is very different on Apple&#39;s App Store, because many of these apps aren&#39;t in the “social networking” category. In the App Store, the top 5 in the category are WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger; on Android, WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram (and Snapchat!) are all in the “communications” category. And Instagram and Snapchat are in the “photo and video” category. X, just like when it was named Twitter, is in the “News” category, where it can look more popular than it actually is.</p><p> Here&#39;s where these apps rank amongst <em>all</em> apps on the App Store:</p><p> 5. TikTok<br /> 6. WhatsApp<br /> 9. Instagram<br /> 13. Facebook<br /> 16. Telegram<br /> 18. Snapchat<br /> 21. Threads<br /> 31. Messenger<br /> 35. X</p><p> They use different ranking formulas (and both keep their formulas secret, to thwart attempts to game the rankings), but both the App Store and Play Store have Threads ahead of X. You&#39;d never guess that from this weekend&#39;s “Threads is a bust” headlines.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nobody Uses Threads Anymore, It&#39;s Too Crowded </title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.warp.dev/?source=df2" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyv" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/warp_your_terminal_reimagined" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40135</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-08-01T00:50:11Z</published><updated> 2023-08-01T00:50:11Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Naomi Nix and Will Oremus, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> With a mandate from Zuckerberg to take a big risk, Mosseri assembled a lean, engineer-heavy team of fewer than 60 people to hack together a bare-bones app on a breakneck timetable more reminiscent of a start-up than an entrenched tech giant. Speaking to investors this week after Meta reported strong earnings, Zuckerberg held up Threads as vindication of his “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/25/meta-layoffs-future-facebook-instagram-company/">year of efficiency</a> ,” in which he sheared tens of thousands of jobs in a bid for more agile teams that would ship products quickly.</p><p> That Threads was created by such a small group in such a short amount of time has become something of a marvel inside Meta, according to current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, as well as private messages viewed by The Post. Many see its quick rise as a reminder that well-executed product launches might not need all the bureaucratic trappings that a company with some 66,000 employees had grown accustomed to.</p><p> “Quick execution. Nothing fancy,” one person wrote on Blind, an anonymous workplace app. “Just solid engineering that most of our <em>ICs</em> [individual contributors] can do but unfortunately are shackled.”</p></blockquote><p> It continues to astound me that anyone with any experience whatsoever would express surprise that a small-ish talented team was so effective. (I say “ish” because 50-60 people isn&#39;t all that small.) Fred Brooks&#39;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a></em> is somehow simultaneously famous and widely-ignored. A larger team would likely have delayed Threads, not accelerated its launch. A <em>much</em> larger team might have doomed the project to failure.</p><blockquote><p> To keep things moving, the Threads team punted thorny decisions and eschewed difficult features, including private messages and the ability to search for content or view the feeds of people you don&#39;t follow. The company also opted not to launch in the European Union, where regulators are preparing to enforce new rules next year requiring tech companies to provide more information to regulators about their algorithms.</p><p> “You do the simple thing first,” Mosseri said. “And I think that also helps reduce the scope, because often what happens is scope creep and you want to add all these things because they&#39;re all great.”</p></blockquote><p> Get something good out, even if it&#39;s missing obvious important features, and start iterating. That&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">the recipe</a> . I&#39;m very curious what the story is going to be for private messages on Threads, though — yet another new messaging silo, or something tied to Instagram&#39;s? Whatever it is, I sure hope it uses E2EE.</p><p> (Twitter DMs, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">infamously</a> , do not use E2EE, so every single ostensibly private message ever sent on Twitter is readable by Twitter employees with access privileges, and thus potentially exposable to the public by either a bug or spite. The same goes for Mastodon, which offers “mentioned people only” messaging, a feature that should not exist, in my opinion, because it creates the illusion of privacy. Better to offer no private messaging at all than offer it without E2EE.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inside Meta’s Threads Launch’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/inside-threads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Research Suggests Facebook&#39;s Algorithm Is &#39;Influential&#39; but Doesn&#39;t Necessarily Change Beliefs </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/technology/facebook-instagram-algorithms.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyt" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/facebook-research" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40133</id><published> 2023-07-31T19:59:42Z</published><updated> 2023-08-01T21:04:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel, reporting last week for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> In the papers, researchers from the University of Texas, New York University, Princeton and other institutions found that removing some key functions of the social platforms&#39; algorithms had “no measurable effects” on people&#39;s political beliefs. In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8424?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D61761082717445531361376140889916401782%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1690482061">one experiment</a> on Facebook&#39;s algorithm, people&#39;s knowledge of political news declined when their ability to reshare posts was removed, the researchers said.</p><p> At the same time, the consumption of political news on Facebook and Instagram was highly segregated by ideology, according to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade7138?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D61761082717445531361376140889916401782%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1690482061">another study</a> . More than 97 percent of the links to news stories rated as false by fact checkers on the apps during the 2020 election drew more conservative readers than liberal readers, the research found. [...] Still, the proportion of false news articles that Facebook users read was low compared with all news articles viewed, researchers said.</p></blockquote><p> False news articles were low overall, but the articles deemed false were overwhelming consumed by conservatives. That&#39;s no surprise, but to me, gets to the heart of the controversy. A hypothetical social media algorithm that promotes true stories and suppresses false ones, with perfect accuracy, is going to be accused by conservatives of being biased against conservatives, because conservatives are drawn to false stories.</p><p> Jeff Horwitz, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-facebook-polarize-users-meta-disagrees-with-partners-over-research-conclusions-24fde67a">reporting for The Wall Street Journal</a> ( <a href="https://apple.news/AZgaujY9rTG2a3TFHtLQryw">News+ link</a> ), on Facebook overstating the degree to which these new studies exonerate its platforms&#39; influence:</p><blockquote><p> Science warned Meta earlier this week that it would publicly dispute an assertion that the published studies should be read as largely exonerating Meta of a contributing role in societal divisions, said Meagan Phelan, who oversees the communication of Science&#39;s findings.</p><p> “The findings of the research suggest Meta algorithms are an important part of what is keeping people divided,” Phelan told Meta&#39;s communications team on Monday, according to an excerpt of her message she shared with The Wall Street Journal. She added that one of the studies found that “compared to liberals, politically conservative users were far more siloed in their news sources, driven in part by algorithmic processes, and especially apparent on Facebook&#39;s Pages and Groups.”</p></blockquote><p> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-social-media-polarize-voters-unprecedented-experiments-facebook-users-reveal">Kai Kupferschmidt&#39;s summary of the four studies for Science</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Research Suggests Facebook’s Algorithm Is ‘Influential’ but Doesn’t Necessarily Change Beliefs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/facebook-research">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Twitter Finally Turns to &#39;X&#39; in App Store Listing </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/twitter-turns-to-x-apple-app-store/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uys" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/twitter-x-app-store-finally" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40132</id><published> 2023-07-31T17:38:35Z</published><updated> 2023-07-31T17:38:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.

<p>Actual headline on ZDNet this week: “ <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apple-needs-a-foldable-iphone-soon-or-iphones-wont-be-worth-buying">Apple Needs a Foldable iPhone Soon or iPhones Won&#39;t Be Worth Buying</a> ”. Philip Berne writes:</p><blockquote><p> Since I bought my iPhone 14 Pro, much cooler phones have come along, and all of them are foldable phones. If Apple doesn&#39;t make a foldable iPhone soon, there won&#39;t be any excitement left, and Apple&#39;s phones will be hard to recommend against the new innovations.</p></blockquote><p> The promise of a foldable device — pocketable folded, tablet-sized unfolded — is obvious. I&#39;ve <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">often</a> held up the super-thin foldable tablets on <em>Westworld</em> as a vision for the future. But the key adjective there is “super-thin”. Double-thick foldables strike me as a niche, and today&#39;s foldables are double-expensive, not just double-thick. Samsung&#39;s new Fold 5, the phone that prompted Berne&#39;s clickbait column, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold5/buy/">starts at $1,800</a> , and offers no dust resistance, only water.</p><p> A decade ago Apple was late to the big-ass phone game. We called them “phablets” then; we call them “phones” now. Those big Android phones were selling well. In a 2013 presentation for planning the company&#39;s 2014 strategy (which became public during discovery in the <em>Apple v. Samsung</em> lawsuit), Apple itself described the situation thus: “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/4/5571926/apple-document-shows-concern-for-iphone-sales-decline-need-for-bigger-iPhone">Consumers want what we don&#39;t have</a> .” (The first larger-screen iPhone, the iPhone 6 Plus, was announced in September 2014.)</p><p> I would wager heavily there were no “Consumers want what we don&#39;t have” slides at Apple this year regarding foldables.</p><p> <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/survey-28-of-us-smartphone-users-highly-likely-to-opt-for-a-foldable-as-next-purchase/">Here&#39;s a report from Counterpoint</a> , who seem <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-foldable-smartphone-shipments-2027/">quite bullish</a> about foldables in the coming years:</p><blockquote><p> In 2022, the foldables category occupied 1.1% of global smartphone shipments, but it scored a vital presence in the ultra-premium segment, taking about 7% of shipments of smartphones priced above $800. According to Counterpoint Research&#39;s Global Foldable Smartphone Market Forecast, Q3 2022, the global foldable smartphone market is expected to reach 22.7 million units in 2023.</p></blockquote><p> 1 percent of total phones and 7 percent of $800+ phones are not big numbers, and I find that 7 percent figure <em>very</em> hard to believe. <a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys/status/1663133413220515840">Here&#39;s a recent report from another firm</a> , Canalys, which lists the top 15 $500+ best-selling phones in the world for Q1 2023. The only foldable on the list, in 10th place, is Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Z Flip4. Not a single book-style foldable on the list, and the Z Flip4 was only a hair ahead of the iPhone SE.</p><p> Foldables — book-style, flip-style, or both — may well become a thing, but they are not yet a thing, because the technology isn&#39;t there yet to make them compelling. (Including simply making them dust resistant.)</p><p> Berne continues:</p><blockquote><p> The Galaxy S23 Ultra is my favorite phone, and tops our best phones list, because it does everything and more. It&#39;s practically a laptop computer stuffed into a phone. Apple isn&#39;t about stuffing. Apple is about refinement.</p></blockquote><p> Doing more than everything is quite an accomplishment. I&#39;m 110 percent surprised I haven&#39;t heard more about this.</p><blockquote><p> Apple, I&#39;ve got good news. The iPhone is refined enough. It is refined well beyond what other manufacturers even care to accomplish. Other phone makers could build a phone that pays just as much attention to detail, they just don&#39;t care to do so. It isn&#39;t worth the effort or cost.</p></blockquote><p> Other basketball players could play as well as Michael Jordan, they just don&#39;t care to do so. It isn&#39;t <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/michael-jordan-net-worth-7552678">worth</a> the cost or effort.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Jackasses of the Week: TechRadar (Foldable Phones Edition)</title></entry><entry><title> X Corp Has Updated Their Mobile Apps, Finally, But the iOS App Is Still &#39;Twitter&#39; in the App Store </title><link href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyn" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/x-app-android-ios" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40127</id><published> 2023-07-28T20:43:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-29T00:54:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Any normal company planning a product name change would have everything sorted out with the iOS App Store and Android Play Store ahead of time. Needless to say, X Corp is not a normal company and so of course they didn&#39;t have anything sorted out. Yesterday an update to the Twitter app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">appeared in Google&#39;s Play Store</a> , with a new icon and new app name: “X”.</p><p> Today, an update to the Twitter app finally appeared on Apple&#39;s App Store. It has the new icon, but the app&#39;s name in the store is still “Twitter”. The app&#39;s description calls it X, though:</p><blockquote><p> The X app is the trusted digital town square for everyone.</p></blockquote><p> And the name of the app installed on your device is “X”.是什么赋予了？ On <s>Twitter</s> X, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickjsheriff/status/1684935759529480192">Nick Sheriff points to a rule</a> I heretofore wasn&#39;t aware of. Apple doesn&#39;t allow single-character app names:</p><blockquote><p> On iOS, the situation is distinct as Apple does not permit any app to have a single character as their app name.</p><p> If they manage to obtain approval, it would mark the first instance since the inception of the iOS App Store that such a permission has been granted.</p></blockquote><p> The rule Sheriff is referencing is about an app&#39;s <em>title</em> in the App Store, not the name of the app as it appears on your device. So who&#39;s going to budge? Will Apple grant a unique exemption allowing X Corp to have the first and only single-character app name in the entire App Store, or will X name the iOS app something longer ( <em>X App</em> ? <em>X: Everything</em> ? <em>X 69</em> ? <em>XXX</em> ? <em>𝕏 (💦✊🍆)</em> ?)</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> I&#39;ve rewritten this post significantly. I was confused, at first, by the different rules for app names (on device) and app titles (listed on the App Store).

<p>Lovely, heartfelt salute to MKBHD from Jon “Front Page Tech” Prosser. Brownlee is so good at what he does, it almost defies description. His reviews are fair, deeply informed, and fun to watch. His taste is exquisite. He&#39;s a dynamic, compelling presence on screen. He&#39;s incredibly prolific yet always leaves you wanting more. The production values of his videos push the envelope of the state of the art: they look and sound (including the music) better than anything else on YouTube, and top YouTubers long ago surpassed broadcast TV in this regard. He&#39;s simultaneously an expert pundit, worldwide on-camera star, and talented filmmaker.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jon Prosser on Marques Brownlee’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/prosser-mkbhd">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Esther Crawford on Twitter, Before and After Charles Foster Musk&#39;s Takeover </title><link href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1684291048682684416" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/crawford-twitter-x" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40125</id><published> 2023-07-28T01:02:11Z</published><updated> 2023-07-29T00:20:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Esther Crawford (previously mentioned <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/28/musk-crawford-haha">here</a> , when she bragged about sleeping at work to meet an unnecessary deadline at Twitter), wrote a fascinating essay about her time at the company, before and after Musk&#39;s acquisition.</p><blockquote><p> Although I didn&#39;t know much about Elon I was cautiously optimistic — I saw him as the guy who built incredible and enduring companies like Tesla and SpaceX, so perhaps his private ownership could shake things up and breathe new life into the company.</p></blockquote><p> Crawford was inside the company, and I&#39;m far outside it, but that&#39;s exactly why <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/27/musk-twitter-open-letter">I was optimistic</a> about Twitter under Musk too. Twitter had ossified years ago — maybe a decade ago — and needed a drastic shake-up, a jolt to the entire system, both in the company&#39;s culture and the product. And while I think Twitter under Musk is now far worse, he absolutely did shake things up, and the overall state of Twitter-like-services is today far, far better than it was before. Mastodon was irrelevant pre-Musk-buying-Twitter. The growth it saw after November never would have happened otherwise. I&#39;m now optimistically bullish on Threads, and I don&#39;t think Threads would even exist if not for Musk buying and wrecking Twitter.</p><p> I thought this was a keen insight:</p><blockquote><p> Elon has an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a different type of social-emotional intelligence.</p></blockquote><p> Another way to think about this (and I&#39;m cribbing from something Ben Thompson said on <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> this week) isn&#39;t about Musk&#39;s lack of empathy, but simply the nature of software itself. The immutable laws of physics push back against Musk&#39;s unreasonable demands in ways that aren&#39;t applicable to software. He doesn&#39;t seem to listen to people who disagree with him, but he has to listen when physics disagrees.

<p>This clip from Illinois governor JB Pritzker&#39;s commencement speech at Northwestern rings so true to me. The older I get, the more my thinking runs along the exact same line. Worth watching the whole clip, but here&#39;s the nut:</p><blockquote><p> The best way to spot an idiot? Look for the person who is cruel. When we see someone who doesn&#39;t look like us, or sound like us, or act like us, or love like us, or live like us — the first thought that crosses almost everyone&#39;s brain is rooted in either fear or judgment or both. That&#39;s evolution. We survived as a species by being suspicious of things we aren&#39;t familiar with.</p><p> In order to be kind, we have to shut down that animal instinct and force our brain to travel a different pathway. Empathy and compassion are evolved states of being. They require the mental capacity to step past our most primal urges. I&#39;m here to tell you that when someone&#39;s path through this world is marked with acts of cruelty, they have failed the first test of an advanced society. They never forced their animal brain to evolve past its first instinct. They never forged new mental pathways to overcome their own instinctual fears. And so, their thinking and problem-solving will lack the imagination and creativity that the kindest people have in spades.</p><p> Over my many years in politics and business, I have found one thing to be universally true: the kindest person in the room is often the smartest.</p></blockquote><p> I like the idea of responding to acts of cruelty with “Idiot”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kindness as a Signifier of Intelligence’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/pritzker-kindness-intelligence">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> You&#39;ll Never Guess What Twitter Did With the Guy Who Had the @x Handle (Spoiler: You Will Guess) </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/26/twitter-now-x-took-over-the-x-handle-without-warning-or-compensating-its-owner/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyh" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/x-handle" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40121</id><published> 2023-07-27T15:41:06Z</published><updated> 2023-07-27T15:41:06Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Company-wide memo from nominal X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/24/read-ceo-linda-yaccarinos-message-to-twitter-staff-about-the-rebrand-to-x.html">sent this morning</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Hi team,</p><p> What a momentous weekend.</p></blockquote><p> Everyone said to me, “ <em>Linda, what are you thinking? You don&#39;t want to work for that guy. He&#39;s crazy and impulsive. You&#39;ve got a great job at NBC. You&#39;ve got a great future ahead of you. If you take this job it&#39;ll tank your career and your name will be a punchline.</em> ” Did I listen to them?</p><blockquote><p> As I said yesterday, it&#39;s extremely rare, whether it&#39;s in life or in business, that you have the opportunity to make another big impression. That&#39;s what we&#39;re experiencing together, in real time. Take a moment to put it all into perspective.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s OK to day-drink.我是。</p><blockquote><p> 17 years ago, Twitter made a lasting imprint on the world. The platform changed the speed at which people accessed information. It created a new dynamic for how people communicated, debated, and responded to things happening in the world. Twitter introduced a new way for people, public figures, and brands to build long lasting relationships. In one way or another, everyone here is a driving force in that change. But equally all our users and partners constantly challenged us to dream bigger, to innovate faster, and to fulfill our great potential.</p></blockquote><p> Twitter was a simple concept with profound impact.</p><blockquote><p> <em>With X we will go even further to transform the global town square — and impress the world all over again.</em></p></blockquote><p>不只是你。 I have no idea what&#39;s going on either.</p><blockquote><p> Our company uniquely has the drive to make this possible.</p></blockquote><p> Fucking Elon.</p><blockquote><p> Many companies say they want to move fast — but we enjoy moving at the speed of light, and when we do, that&#39;s X.</p></blockquote><p> According to Einstein&#39;s theory of special relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, the object&#39;s mass becomes infinite and so too does the energy required to move it. But this holds true, in degree, for all objects in motion, and a mind-bending aspect of special relativity is that the faster an object is moving, the more slowly it experiences <em>time</em> . If you were able to move at the speed of light, time wouldn&#39;t pass at all. It would be like being damned for eternity, forever caught in the current moment, while the world moves on for everyone else.</p><p> I think about this.</p><blockquote><p> At our core, we have an inventor mindset — constantly learning, testing out new approaches, changing to get it right and ultimately succeeding.</p></blockquote><p> We are hemorrhaging cash and our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/twitter-ad-sales-musk.html">advertisers are still fleeing</a> .</p><blockquote><p> With X, we serve our entire community of users and customers by working tirelessly to preserve free expression and choice, create limitless interactivity, and create a marketplace that enables the economic success of all its participants.</p></blockquote><p> I used to run all advertising for NBCUniversal. Now I&#39;m running an $8/month multi-level marketing scheme where the only users who&#39;ve signed up are men who own a collection of MAGA hats.</p><blockquote><p> The best news is we&#39;re well underway.</p></blockquote><p> There is no hope.</p><blockquote><p> Everyone should be proud of the pace of innovation over the last nine months — from long form content, to creator monetization, and tremendous advancements in brand safety protections.</p></blockquote><p> Have you seen the ads we&#39;re running these days? Last week we were filling everyone&#39;s timeline with ads for discount chewable boner pills, the <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueChew/status/1653025204501721089">punchline of which ads</a> is that you&#39;ll bang your lady so hard she&#39;ll need the aid of a walker afterward. That&#39;s a video we promoted to everyone. This week it&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1684247403065659393">anime for foot fetishists</a> . That&#39;s what we put in everyone&#39;s feed, every three tweets. Or X&#39;s, or whatever we&#39;re now calling them. I used to book hundred-million-dollar Olympic sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Proctor &amp; Gamble.

Leave while you can put on your resume that you worked for “Twitter”.</p><blockquote><p> You&#39;re writing history, and there&#39;s no limit to our transformation.</p></blockquote><p> As if this rebranding disaster isn&#39;t enough, our infrastructure is crumbling. Facebook took Threads from 0 to 100 million users in under a week, without a hitch, at the same time we imposed <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/update-on-twitters-limited-usage.html">comical rate limits</a> on usage. I mean can you even believe that shit? I still can&#39;t. I said to him, “Elon, we are an ad-based business. Our revenue is directly commensurate to usage. This is like running a casino and turning the slot machines off to save on the electricity bill. It makes no sense.” And Elon was like “Bots!”</p><blockquote><p> And everyone, is invited to build X with us.</p></blockquote><p> I think I, saw on a TV show once that a hostage was able, to signal to authorities the need for help without alerting, their captors by placing commas randomly in their sentences.</p><blockquote><p> Elon and I will be working across every team and partner to bring X to the world. That includes keeping our entire community up to date, ensuring that we all have the information we need to move forward.</p></blockquote><p> I found out about this name change when you did, at midnight on Saturday, and I have no idea what that fucker is going to do next or when he&#39;s going to do it. You know this. You know that I know that you know this. But I&#39;m going to persist with the charade that these decisions are being made by a team that I&#39;m a leader of, because to do otherwise would be even more humiliating.</p><blockquote><p> Now, let&#39;s go make that next big impression on the world, together.</p><p> Linda</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p> Linda</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Translation From Hostage Code to English of X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino&#39;s Company-Wide Memo</title></entry><entry><title> Apple&#39;s MLS Deal Seems to Be Doing Well </title><link href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Journal/Issues/2023/07/24/Insiders/sports-media.aspx?ana=top_stories" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyf" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/mls-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40119</id><published> 2023-07-26T00:13:02Z</published><updated> 2023-07-26T22:11:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>John Ourand and Alex Silverman, reporting for Sports Business Journal:</p><blockquote><p> As Apple&#39;s Eddy Cue began speaking to a room filled with MLS owners and executives last week in Washington, DC, he harked back to conversations he had with league officials a year earlier, just as Apple was signing a 10-year deal for the league&#39;s media rights.</p><p> At that time, Cue recalled last Wednesday, when several MLS owners and league executives came up to him and asked what the teams could do to help ensure that the groundbreaking deal was successful, Cue would offer the same response — sign good players.</p><p> Addressing the MLS board of governors just days before the world&#39;s greatest soccer player, Lionel Messi, would debut for Inter Miami CF, Cue smiled and told the group of MLS owners and officials, “Boy did you deliver.”</p></blockquote><p> Messi&#39;s debut on Friday was spectacularly dramatic — <a href="https://twitter.com/InterMiamiCF/status/1682575130269032448">a game-winning free kick in extra time</a> . If you put that in a movie script people would roll their eyes.</p><blockquote><p> The number of MLS Season Pass subscribers is a closely guarded secret. Viewership figures for individual games are never shared publicly. Multiple high-level club business executives said they were required by [Apple, <em>sic</em> ] to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to see any numbers pertaining to the number of MLS Season Pass subscribers. [...]</p><p> Sources said MLS Season Pass is approaching 1 million subscribers, a number that includes season-ticket holders who are provided access as part of their purchase. In early June, those same sources had the MLS Season Pass subscriber base at 700,000, which league executives believe shows good growth, and they expect that number to balloon even further once Messi starts playing.</p></blockquote><p> One of the striking differences between traditional TV broadcasting and streaming — not just for sports, but everything — is that with traditional TV, viewership ratings are public. The networks brag about high ratings. With streaming, viewership is a tightly-held secret. Is 1 million subscribers an accurate count for MLS Season Pass? Only Apple knows. Is that a good number? It&#39;s hard to say, because the NFL, NBA, and MLB keep the numbers for their equivalent subscription packages secret too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple’s MLS Deal Seems to Be Doing Well’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/mls-apple">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Threads Now Has a Chronological Timeline </title><link href="https://www.threads.net/@threadsapp/post/CvIMnF9AQYC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uye" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/threads-following-timeline" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40118</id><published> 2023-07-25T23:38:16Z</published><updated> 2023-07-25T23:38:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jacob Wallace, Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, and Jason L. Schwartz, in a paper published in JAMA Internal Medicine, “Excess Death Rates for Republican and Democratic Registered Voters in Florida and Ohio During the COVID-19 Pandemic”:</p><blockquote><p> Between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021, there were 538,159 individuals in Ohio and Florida who died at age 25 years or older in the study sample. The median age at death was 78 years (IQR, 71-89 years). Overall, the excess death rate for Republican voters was 2.8 percentage points, or 15%, higher than the excess death rate for Democratic voters (95% prediction interval [PI], 1.6-3.7 percentage points). After May 1, 2021, when vaccines were available to all adults, the excess death rate gap between Republican and Democratic voters widened from −0.9 percentage point (95% PI, −2.5 to 0.3 percentage points) to 7.7 percentage points (95% PI, 6.0-9.3 percentage points) in the adjusted analysis; the excess death rate among Republican voters was 43% higher than the excess death rate among Democratic voters. The gap in excess death rates between Republican and Democratic voters was larger in counties with lower vaccination rates and was primarily noted in voters residing in Ohio.</p></blockquote><p> This study strongly suggests that the only thing that mattered regarding COVID mortality was vaccination. Also, COVID was/is a disease that largely kills the elderly — the excess mortality in this study was entirely amongst people 75 and older. Even amongst those 65–74, excess mortality was <em>down</em> .

<p>Si Daniels, principal program manager for fonts and typography, Microsoft Office design (my god do people at Microsoft have long titles), in a <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230713/p36#a230713p36">much-noted</a> post last week on Medium, <sup id="fnr1-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn1-2023-07-21">1</a></sup> “ <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/a-change-of-typeface-microsofts-new-default-font-has-arrived-f200eb16718d">A Change of Typeface: Microsoft&#39;s New Default Font Has Arrived</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Dear every human on earth that&#39;s ever typed text,</p></blockquote><p> I know this is just a lighthearted salutation, but it&#39;s not the <em>typing</em> of text that exposes “everyone” to Office&#39;s default font, it&#39;s the <em>reading</em> of text. I have never regularly used any Office app other than Excel, and that was over 20 years ago. But it&#39;s impossible not to encounter documents created with Office, whether you personally use it or not. Thus, Microsoft&#39;s typographic choices affect us all. (I&#39;ve never once set anything in Arial, for example, but it&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/arial">a near daily irritation</a> thanks to its ubiquity.)</p><blockquote><p> For 15 years, our beloved Calibri was Microsoft&#39;s default font and crown keeper of office communications, but as you know, our relationship has come to a <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">natural end</a> . We changed. The technology we use every day has changed. And so, our search of the perfect font for higher resolution screens began. The font needed to have sharpness, uniformity, and be great for display type. It was exciting at times, but also intimidating. How do you replace Calibri? How do you find that one true font that can take its place as the rightful default?</p><p> As we <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">shared</a> before, Microsoft commissioned five new fonts: Bierstadt, Grandview, Seaford, Skeena, and Tenorite. It was our hope that one of them would be our next default font for Microsoft 365. All of them were added to the drop-down font picker. From there, as you got a chance to use them, we listened to your impassioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421384582733827">feedback</a> and chose the one that resonated most which was Bierstadt. But as there was a change of guard so too the name. Bierstadt is now known as Aptos.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t know if Microsoft actually chose Aptos (née Bierstadt) based on customer feedback, but it says a lot about the company either way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ" title="Steve Jobs: “Microsoft has no taste.”">Companies that have taste</a> do not conduct design via surveys. (My guess is they&#39;re full of shit and probably knew all along they were going to go with Aptos/Bierstadt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/microsofts-new-default-font-options-rated/" title="Devin Coldewey at TechCrunch: “Microsoft’s New Default Font Options, Rated”">the obvious choice</a> , from the start. The “survey”, such that it was, seemingly consisted of <a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421384582733827">just reading people&#39;s replies on Twitter</a> .)</p><p> What I find weird about the whole thing is that Microsoft still hasn&#39;t really shown any of these new fonts. They&#39;ve provided glimpses of them, but mostly at large display sizes, not text sizes, which is where they really matter in the context of Office documents. I&#39;m not the only one <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/aptos-default-office-font/">to find this curious</a> .</p><p> So I took matters into my own hands, and created rudimentary specimens for each of Microsoft&#39;s five new typefaces (and Calibri to boot). A–Z in upper- and lowercase, 0–9, and the most common punctuation marks. Then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/30/hoeflers-proof">a paragraph of sample text</a> at 11 points. Dear reader, you really owe me for this one, because I had to use the web app version of Word, by way of Microsoft 365 <sup id="fnr2-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn2-2023-07-21">2</a></sup> to produce these PDFs. To describe this software as brutal and frustrating is an understatement. Herewith, the PDF specimens, and my brief comments:</p><ul><li><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Aptos%20(Bierstadt)%20Specimen.pdf">Aptos</a> — Designed by <a href="https://mattesontypographics.com/">Steve Matteson</a> . I don&#39;t know why Microsoft states as fact that Calibri somehow <em>needed</em> to be replaced as their default font just because it&#39;s 15 years old. A good default font should stand the test of time for decades, if not a literal lifetime. <sup id="fnr3-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn3-2023-07-21">3</a></sup> But if Microsoft feels the need to chase fleeting fashion rather than timeless style, Aptos is the trendiest of the bunch: grotesque sans serifs are having a moment. Aptos is by no means a rip-off of <a href="https://medium.com/@amachino/the-secret-of-san-francisco-fonts-4b5295d9a745">Apple&#39;s San Francisco</a> , but it is, by far, the most San-Francisco-esque of any of these typefaces. Noteworthy characters: J (stunted and ugly), Q (small tail), R (inspired by <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/1160/univers">Univers</a> ?), g (double-story, reminiscent of <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/1763/itc-franklin-gothic">Franklin Gothic</a> &#39;s), and the numeral 1 (curved hat, <em>à la</em> , of all fonts, Arial). But the most distinctive character is the lowercase L, which has a curve to differentiate it from the uppercase i and numeral 1.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Grandview%20Specimen.pdf">Grandview</a> — Designer <a href="https://www.sajatypeworks.com">Aaron Bell</a> <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">admits</a> Grandview was largely inspired by DIN, and it certainly looks like it. Far too mechanical to serve as the default font. For chrissake look at those quotation marks and apostrophes.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Seaford%20Specimen.pdf">Seaford</a> — Designed by <a href="https://frerejones.com/about">Tobias Frere-Jones, Nina Stössinger, and Fred Shallcrass</a> . Seaford strikes me as the only other font in the bunch that might conceivably have been chosen as the new default. If Microsoft had better (any?) taste, they <em>would</em> have chosen Seaford. Seaford strikes my eye as most similar to <a href="http://www.martinmajoor.com/1_scala.html">Martin Majoor&#39;s rightfully renowned and beloved Scala Sans</a> , with — <em>maybe</em> — a wee dose of influence from, of all typefaces, Frere-Jones&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/16/hfj">ex-partner</a> Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s aptly-named <a href="https://typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/styles">Ideal Sans</a> . <sup id="fnr4-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn4-2023-07-21">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Skeena%20Specimen.pdf">Skeena</a> — Designed by <a href="http://www.tiro.com/">John Hudson</a> and <a href="https://www.tandemtype.co/">Paul Hanslow</a> .

Admittedly inspired by Adrian Frutiger&#39;s hall-of-fame typeface <a href="https://www.fontshop.com/search#?q=Avenir">Avenir</a> , and looks like it.

It&#39;s not my bag, personally, <sup id="fnr5-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn5-2023-07-21">5</a></sup> but Calibri is both a very good sans serif and a fine default for Office. There&#39;s no reason Microsoft couldn&#39;t have stuck with Calibri for decades to come.</p></li></ul><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/New%20Office%20Font%20Specimens.zip">Here&#39;s a zip archive of all 6 specimens</a> , if you&#39;d prefer to download them all.</p><h2> Original Postscript</h2><p> The kerning is rather awful in all of these PDF specimens, at times jarringly so. I suspect, or at least hope, the problem is with the web version of Word (which I presume has its own text rendering engine), not the fonts themselves. Look, for example, at the words <em>milliner</em> and <em>Uncle</em> (which looks like “Unde” in some of them) in the sample text. If these fonts were available for download, I&#39;d have typeset the specimens using better software, but they&#39;re not, so I can&#39;t. I suppose I could fish out the web fonts used by Microsoft 365, but this whole endeavor has consumed enough of my time as it is.</p><h2> New Postscript, Updated 22 July</h2><p> The kerning problem with the original PDFs I produced was indeed, ultimately, caused by the fact that I was using the web version of Microsoft Word. Friend of the show <a href="https://glennf.com/">Glenn Fleishman</a> used the native Mac version of Word to produce new PDFs from my Word documents, and the kerning problems are gone. All of the above links now go the updated PDFs. (And of course Glenn, of all people, cared enough to lend a hand.)
