<p>沙漠岛唱片是BBC音频采访计划，由Lauren Laverne主持（或<em>提出</em>）。头是要求客人命名八首歌，一本书和一本“奢侈品”，如果滞留在荒岛上，他们会带来的“奢侈品”，而这些挑选（包括播放歌曲）在整个采访中都散布着。本周的客人是乔尼·艾夫（Jony Ive），这是我遇到过的最好的采访之一。令人难以置信的周到和鼓舞人心，Laverne掩盖了很多地面，而且似乎最少匆忙。</p><p>来自我的一些亮点：</p><blockquote><p>我认为，我的斗争之一在某种程度上是我认为，我认为，我努力在现在挣扎，因为将来我一生都在脑海中度过了很多。我试图理解未来的方式是我对过去着迷。因此，现在经常被错过的位是现在。</p></blockquote><p>我知道那种感觉。</p><p>关于他在苹果的早年，在与史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）统一之前和史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）的回归之前，我谈到了该公司严重的财务困扰偏向对产品的看法：</p><blockquote><p>我认为当您挣扎时，目标可能只是商业问题。我明白 - 我的意思是，如果您损失了很多钱，您想停止损失很多钱。问题在于，这意味着您专注于金钱，而且通常会损失钱，因为产品不正确。从92年到97年，这是一个非常非常困难的季节。我非常感谢 - 但有时我仍然会感到颤抖。</p></blockquote><p>该段落中使用的讲述词是“正确的”。他本来可以说问题是苹果90年代中期的产品不是“好”，但他没有。判断他们是好是坏，这不是正确的框架。他们是不对<em>的</em>。正确的主观性。 <em>Je ne Sais Quoi</em> 。最初的iMac启动了Ive与史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）的漫长而富有成果的合作，这并不是一件好事，因为它很好，因为它显然是<em>正确的</em>。</p><p> <a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/">（</a>英国广播公司（BBC <a href="https://overcast.fm/uploads">）</a>的<a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/b006qnmr.rss">《沙漠岛光盘》的播客供稿</a>似乎在网站上大约一个月后运行。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“荒岛碟片”上的“乔尼·艾夫”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/ive-desert-island-discs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>苹果股东肯定地拒绝抛弃公司“包容性和多样性”政策的提议；特朗普以他通常的平等回应</title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/trump-on-apple-diversity-policies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/apple-shareholders-reject-proposl-to-ditch-diversity-policies" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41608</id><published> 2025-02-26T16：42：13Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T18：19：47Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>迈克尔·利德克（Michael Liedtke），报道AP：</p><blockquote><p>苹果股东拒绝了试图向技术趋势趋势者施加压力，以加入总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的努力擦洗旨在使劳动力多样化的公司计划。</p><p>国家公共政策研究中心起草的<a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2025/Proxy_Statement_2025.pdf">提案</a>（<a href="https://nationalcenter.org/about/">一个自称为保守的智囊团</a>）敦促苹果遵循<a href="https://apnews.com/article/companies-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-lawsuits-753f027bb73a1035a919482427553ea3">一系列备受瞩目的公司，</a>这些公司已从特朗普政府十字准将目前在多元化，公平和包容性计划中撤退。</p><p>经过有关反对提案的简短演讲，苹果宣布股东拒绝了它。在周二晚上提交的监管文件中，苹果透露，有97％的选票是对该措施的投票。</p></blockquote><p>特朗普总统今天早上8点<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114070315739588346">在他自己的非常受欢迎的社交网络上</a>：</p><blockquote><p>苹果应该摆脱DEI规则，而不仅仅是对它们进行调整。 Dei是一个骗局，对我国非常有害。 Dei走了！！！</p></blockquote><p>不用说，国家公共政策研究中心是一堆叮当，特朗普根本不知道<a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/">苹果的实际政策和目标是多样性的</a>- 他只是知道他希望他们离开。 （我喜欢Macrumors的Joe Rossignol<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/trump-on-apple-diversity-policies/">为他的故事提供的报告</a>。）</p><p>确实存在着一个正式的dei世界，直到使用该缩写。将其视为<em>Dei™</em> 。尽管结果<a href="https://jabberwocking.com/does-dei-even-work/">强烈地表明它不起作用，</a>并且<a href="https://jabberwocking.com/university-dei-statements-are-a-demeaning-charade/">一些明显令人反感的教条要求</a>，但一些<a href="https://jabberwocking.com/how-is-dei-going-at-the-university-of-michigan/">大学似乎对此有所超越</a>。但是，从这些话来说，任何公司（或大学或组织）都应该关注多样性和包容。不仅是道德的“<em>应该成为事物的方式</em>”的原因，而且<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">经验研究表明</a>，不同的组织更加成功。</p><p>这是一个频谱。美国许多大学都位于该范围的最左边。特朗普政府及其支持者显然是在这个范围的最右边，他们现在正在寻求向公司施加压力，甚至没有以“多样性”的意义对自己的“多样性”施加压力，并且正在政府机构词“女人”和“残疾”等政府机构擦洗。我过分简单地将左/右划分为一维的划分。例如，特朗普的“正确”与20年前的布什 - 切尼时代相比，迎来了截然不同的“正确”。但是DEI™“左”与<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/cancel-culture-illiberalism-dead/681031/">真正的自由自由语音左语的</a>左派截然不同。自由主义者反对Dei的僵化，教条和表演性质；特朗普及其同伙反对实际的人类多样性和包容性。</p><p>近年来，一些大公司在“ DEI倡议”方面越来越遥遥无期，并且正在利用当前的政治时刻<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lowes-dei-harley-davidson-john-deere-tractor-supply/">将朝向（对我来说，明智的）中心纠正</a>。但是，本课程更正始于特朗普连任。这是<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html">2023年12月的CNBC故事，</a>在Google和Meta缩放正式的DEI计划上。</p><p>从我的观察中，苹果长期以来一直在此类问题上绘制了自己的一致课程，直到将其政策称为“包容性和多样性”，而不是名字品牌“ dei”。苹果没有在#MeToo和Black Lives Matter Matters动作的左侧向左冲刺，因为它们不需要。因此，他们现在不需要纠正。苹果股东似乎同意。</p><div> <a  title="与苹果股东的永久链接肯定拒绝抛弃公司的“包容性和多样性”政策的提议；特朗普以他通常的平等回应’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/apple-shareholders-reject-proposl-to-ditch-diversity-policies">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Rene Ritchie真正地谈论iPhone 16e</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5OdiEzJNgk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/25/rene-ritchie-iphone-16e" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41607</id><published> 2025-02-25T22：55：12Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T22：55：12Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>迈克·艾伦（Mike Allen）为阿克西奥斯（Axios）写信，标题为“特朗普制造胜利：苹果将在美国花5000亿美元，雇用20,000美元”：</p><blockquote><p>特朗普周四在椭圆形办公室与库克会面。然后，特朗普感到非常兴奋，以至于他过早地揭示了计划，并在与州长会面时说，库克正在“投资数千亿美元。我希望他已经宣布了这一点 - 我希望我没有宣布，但是到底是什么？我要做的就是说实话 - 这就是他告诉我的。现在他必须这样做，对吗？”</p><p>特朗普继续说：“他也投资了数千亿美元。” “我们将有很多芯片制造商进来，很多汽车制造商进来。他们在墨西哥停止了……开始建造的两家植物。他们只是停止了他们 - 他们将在这里建造它们，因为他们不想支付关税。关税很棒。”</p></blockquote><p>我敢肯定，苹果和蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）很高兴今天宣布以这种方式将其描绘成“特朗普制造的胜利”，尽管事实上，这似乎完全符合苹果自2018年以来为美国创造工作的轨迹，其中包括<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">2021年几乎相同的公告（在2021年的</a>一项近乎相同的宣布（在很大程度上是很大程度上，但<a href="https://abc11.com/post/apple-nc-east-coast-hub-on-hold-research-triangle-park-3-years-later-1-billion-project/14997218/">并非完全</a>，但遵循）。</p><p>不过，墨西哥角度响起了我的耳朵。彭博社上也拿起了这一点，在周末的标题上，上面写着“<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tim-cook-meeting-trump-220006653.html">特朗普说库克将苹果制造业从墨西哥转移到我们</a>”。</p><p>我记得苹果在墨西哥组装的最后一件事是1995年的少数晚模型扩展了键盘II（<a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">不如其美国制造的型号</a>，就像我用来写这件模型一样）。在随后的几十年中，我很有可能会忽略一些墨西哥制造的苹果产品，但是如果有的话，它们不是最近的。因此，我怀疑蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）上周在与特朗普的会晤中卖给了他一份商品，并且或多或少地说服了特朗普，苹果<em>一直</em>在委托墨西哥的一些新植物（一个如此讨厌<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco">特朗普的国家（Trump）没收了他们的海湾</a>），但由于特朗普总统鼓舞人心的领导层，苹果公司将在德克萨斯州的大型苹果公司中建立了这些植物，这是苹果公司在所有苹果公司中都付诸实践。</p><div> <a  title="与“完成任务的任务：特朗普”的永久链接，尤其是关于墨西哥的计划，我认为不是真实的”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/mission-accomplished">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>苹果宣布计划在未来四年内在美国花费超过5000亿美元（这可能正是他们一直在计划做的事情） </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41603</id><published> 2025-02-24T20：23：36z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T01：43：49Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>苹果新闻编辑室：</p><blockquote><p>苹果今天宣布了有史以来最大的支出承诺，计划在未来四年内在美国支出和投资超过5000亿美元。</p></blockquote><p>当然，在这一宣布方面做出了重要意义的背景是，苹果正在寻求免税特朗普政府的关税。甚至5000亿美元的资金也是很多钱，即使对于苹果来说，在未来四年中，有20,000个新工作是很多工作，尤其是在许多大型科技公司裁员而不是雇用的时候。 （如果您还没有听说，联邦政府也试图解雇很多员工。）但是，<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-earmarks-500-billion-for-u-s-expansion-19ca11a0">正如WSJ在此公告中的故事中所指出的那样</a>，这20,000个新工作是他们现有的招聘增长的延续：“截至9月，该公司在过去五年中每年增加了164,000名全职同等雇员，在过去的五年中每年增加了5,400名。”</p><p>苹果四年前宣布了类似的计划 -  4,300亿美元和20,000个工作岗位。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">苹果在宣布2021年计划的宣布中说</a>：“在过去的三年中，苹果在美国的捐款大大超过了该公司在2018年的最初五年目标。”</p><p>因此，我认为这一消息根本不是胡说八道。但是我也认为，如果卡马拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）在11月的少数州中获得了1-2％的<em>选票</em>，那么苹果今天宣布的今天与他们将要做的事情大不相同。不同之处在于，每个人都在寻求交易额，总统返回办公室。</p><p>再次苹果：</p><blockquote><p>作为其新投资的一部分，Apple将与制造合作伙伴合作，于今年晚些时候在休斯敦开始生产服务器。一个250,000平方英尺的服务器制造工厂将于2026年开放，将创造数千个就业机会。</p><p>以前在美国以外制造的服务器很快将在休斯敦组装，在为Apple Intelligence提供动力方面起着关键作用，并且是Private Cloud Compute的基础，将强大的AI处理与有史以来最先进的安全体系结构相结合，用于AI Cloud Computing。苹果工程师将服务器汇集了多年的研发，并将苹果硅的行业领先安全和性能交付到数据中心。</p></blockquote><p>有趣的是，大型制造新闻是苹果甚至没有销售的产品，而仅用于其自己的使用。我不<em>认为</em>这暗示他们可能会<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/05/apple-discontinues-xserve-only-available-until-january-31st/">再次</a>出售服务器，但是谁知道呢？我也想知道，在这里而不是在中国，是否有一个公司 - 高级安全角度来组装这些服务器。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“苹果公司宣布计划在未来四年内在美国花费超过5000亿美元（这可能正是他们计划做的事情）"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>惠普添加了电话支持电话15分钟的等待时间</title><link href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/20/hp_deliberately_adds_15_minutes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41602</id><published> 2025-02-24T17：59：57Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T18：49：42Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>自从12月发行以来，我一直在意思，链接到“ Linus Tech Tips”名声的<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">Linus Sebastian的这段视频</a>，并且本周iPhone 16e下降了，现在似乎是个好时机。这是一种常见的流派，可以追溯到YouTube甚至是一件事之前的几十年：平台X的长期用户切换到竞争对手的平台y几周，然后解释他们喜欢的东西，他们不喜欢的东西，他们没有让他们感到困惑等。这种事情总是会增加黑客，因为有一个自然的人类倾向于获得部落的倾向 - 如果不挑剔的宗教 - 关于一个选择的平台。塞巴斯蒂安（Sebastian）的介绍（播放YouTube的算法）以某种方式将其构图似乎使他对iOS的总体看法将是炎症的。他说，就在20分钟视频的前30秒内：</p><blockquote><p>在我的iOS挑战赛几天后，我开始对我一生中的苹果用户有所不同。他们描述了苹果产品的营销口号，例如“它只是有效的”，就好像他们真的相信他们一样，这让我感到奇怪，苹果公司对真正的信徒有一个版本的产品，然后对像我这样的磨砂膏有不同的产品？因为我在iPhone 16 Plus上的时间绝对充满了不直觉的设计选择，功能不必要的功能以及我多年来遇到的一些最奇怪的错误。</p></blockquote><p>我第一次观看视频时，我的手指在这一点上开始徘徊在封闭式按钮上。但是，这个挑衅的开放并不能真正代表塞巴斯蒂安的实际观察和抱怨。这只是YouTube/社交媒体风格。我？我会以最少的炎症方式开始一篇文章，例如，以最少的炎症方式打扰我，以开放人们的思想，并获得尽可能多的Android支持者放松身心，并听取我的论点。然后，我会尝试提出案例，建立一个渐强的措施，在那里我只能在最后得出炎症结论。 YouTube的工作方式相反 - 您以挑衅性的方式开始，以提高骇客，因为愤怒会促进参与度，但随后又回到了合理的方向上。</p><p>塞巴斯蒂安（Sebastian）是一位长期的Android用户，但他根本不是一个电话。通常，他通常不会审查手机。他自己的个人Android手机已经使用了几年。他的兴趣和知名度完全在PC领域。因此，他的视频并不是真正的“ <em>Android Power用户评论iOS</em> ”，而是“<em>也是Android用户也尝试一个月的PC Power用户</em>”。</p><p>我喜欢这些视频，因为此时我全面介绍了iOS。自2010年Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One">Nexus One</a>以来，我一直在桌子上保留了一部Android手机，但是仍然在我的桌子上的那张手机是一个五岁的像素4。我对Android上的最新时间比以往任何时候都感到更加不联系。因此，这样的视频是从与围栏iPhone一侧的最先进的人过时的人的角度来看，这真的很有趣。</p><p>塞巴斯蒂安（Sebastian）结束了对iOS和iPhone体验的精明批评。他们都不是我的新手，他们都没有真正让我因不加入Android的一员而失去任何东西。但是他的大多数抱怨都是完全合法的 - 其中很多是苹果应该解决的问题。他反复抱怨iOS的动画过渡，使一切感觉都很慢。这是100％真实的。作为日常iPhone用户，我完全习惯了。但是这些动画确实使iPhone感觉比它们慢。就技术规格而言，iPhone实际上是地球上最快的手机。苹果的A系列硅曾经，而且一直比最好的硅货币在Android手机中购买的数年要领先数年。但是，由于iOS（NOR IPADOS）无需选择加速的动画过渡，因此iOS的许多方面<em>都比</em>Android慢。它应该。并且可以完全关闭动画的可访问性设置无法解决问题；我想要的，我认为塞巴斯蒂安想要什么，是<em>更快的</em>动画。 （Sebastian还合理地抱怨这样的事实是，许多有用的iOS设置被掩埋在可访问性下。可访问性中的许多设置与可访问性有关，但是其中许多设置在不存在的“高级”部分中会更好地找到。）</p><p>塞巴斯蒂安还正确地将iOS串成令人困惑的音量设置； Android肯定会在这里获胜。重新布置的主屏幕图标很吸引iOS。 Carplay有烦人的错误。我的新鲜眼睛被我的刚刚接受的东西感到恼火：苹果的第一方应用程序倾向于将其偏好设置放在设置应用程序中，但是第三方应用程序往往会将其及其应用。 （但是现在，苹果也开始使用像Sports这样的新应用程序来做到这一点。）</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">给视频手表</a>。再说一次，这并没有让我在栅栏的Android方面造成嫉妒的一生，但它使我想起了iOS上的一堆事情，这些东西没有任何意义，而且看来它们的方式仅仅是因为它们一直是它们的样子。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“转向iPhone 30天后，莱纳斯·塞巴斯蒂安的想法”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>深入“深” </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/18/deep-peak-deep-deepseek-ai-tech-chatgpt-naming/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/22/going-deep-on-deep" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41599</id><published> 2025-02-22T15：42：55Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T19：05：57Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>苹果在今天早上发给媒体的非常精确的措辞陈述中：</p><blockquote><p>苹果不再向新用户提供英国的高级数据保护（ADP），而当前的英国用户最终将需要禁用此安全功能。 ADP使用端到端加密保护iCloud数据，这意味着只有拥有数据的用户才能解密数据，并且只能在其受信任的设备上进行解密。我们感到非常失望的是，鉴于数据泄露和对客户隐私的其他威胁，ADP提供的保护将无法为我们的客户提供。通过端到端加密增强云存储的安全性比以往任何时候都更加紧迫。 Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">As we have said many times before</a> , we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.</p></blockquote><p> The context for this is the news that broke two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM4OTA0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwMjg2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzg5MDQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImRiNmNkODlmLThiZjMtNDkwMy05ZjJlLTFkYmIxOGJmNTViNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDIvMDcvYXBwbGUtZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1iYWNrZG9vci11ay8ifQ.jmi16EkHDs4oV8NT_duwmo2NQd8rxE3enCtbFsh8KNU&amp;itid=gfta">by Joseph Menn in The Washington Post</a> , and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57b391a0-c531-4cde-a5e9-c5d60b21a161">Tim Bradshaw in the Financial Times</a> , that (quoting Menn&#39;s report, emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p> Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. The British government&#39;s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. [...]</p><p> The office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence, the people said. The law, known by critics as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, <em>makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand</em> . An Apple spokesman declined to comment.</p></blockquote><p> By definition, end-to-end encryption can have no secret backdoor, so compliance with this order from the UK would, in broad strokes, require Apple to abandon end-to-end encryption — not just for users in the UK but all users in all countries globally. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-21"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-21">1</a></sup> More insidiously and outrageously, they are apparently forbidden by UK law, under severe penalty (imprisonment), from even informing the public about this demand, or, if they were to comply, from telling the public what they&#39;ve done. The UK expects Apple to give them secret access to all iCloud data without Apple telling anyone — including, I believe, <em>even the US government</em> — that they&#39;ve granted the UK government this breathtaking access.</p><p> Rather than comply, Apple is choosing instead to pull Advanced Data Protection from the UK. For UK users not already using ADP, the ability to enable it was already turned off before Apple&#39;s statement was sent. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">This report from BBC News</a> has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/uk-adp-screenshot.jpeg">a screenshot</a> of what UK users see if they attempt to enable it today.</p><p> Re-read Apple&#39;s statement above, which I&#39;ve quoted in full, including the hyperlink. What stands out is that Apple is offering no explanation, not even a hint, <em>why</em> the company “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature”. On issues pertaining to security and privacy, Apple always explains its policies and features as best it can. The fact that Apple has offered no hint as to why they&#39;re doing this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">canary statement</a> of sorts: they&#39;re making clear as best they can that they&#39;re under a legal gag order that prevents them from even acknowledging that they&#39;re under a legal gag order, by not telling us why they&#39;re no longer able to offer ADP in the UK. This sort of read-between-the-lines implicit confirmation that they&#39;re under a gag order is the only sort of confirmation they can legally offer, at risk of imprisonment.</p><p> Enabling ADP is controlled server-side, so Apple was able to disable the ability for UK users to turn on ADP without requiring a software update to devices. But it&#39;s an open question how this will play out for users in the UK who already have ADP enabled. Apple cannot disable ADP remotely. With a moment&#39;s thought, you can realize why they can&#39;t: it would defeat the entire purpose. In the same way that Apple can&#39;t hold its own key to decrypt a user&#39;s data with ADP, they also can&#39;t hold the ability to disable ADP.</p><p> Enabling ADP is reversible, however. After turning it on, a user can revert to standard protection, turning it off. But they must <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/adp-turn-off-screenshot.png">manually confirm</a> it. I suspect what Apple is going to do for UK users with ADP already enabled is begin issuing warnings, instructing them to disable it manually, before some deadline. Once that deadline passes, I think Apple will have to stop allowing iCloud access to ADP-protected accounts in the UK. That won&#39;t leave the data of those users unprotected — they simply will lose access to sync until they disable ADP and revert to standard protection.</p><p> The bottom line is that the UK government is proceeding like a tyrannical authoritarian state. That&#39;s not hyperbole. And the breathtaking scope of their order — being able to secretly snoop, without notice that they even have the capability, not only on their own citizens but every Apple user in the entire world — suggests a delusional belief that the British Empire still stands. It&#39;s simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hack-us-telecoms-salt-typhoon-88cabc592dae2fa870772c5ce4ace5ea">recent Salt Typhoon attack</a> China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK&#39;s actual power and standing in the world.</p><p> Apple is, rightly and righteously, telling them to fuck off.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-21"><p> If you use Advanced Data Protection, your iCloud data can only be decrypted (a) by your own devices, (b) using the recovery key that you control from when you enabled ADP, or (c) by any recovery contacts you&#39;ve created in iCloud. Apple insists that you must generate a recovery key or specify at least one recovery contact to enable ADP. Lose your devices, lose your recovery key, and lose your iCloud passphrase, and no one, including Apple, can recover your iCloud data. That level of cryptographically guaranteed security is the benefit of ADP. It&#39;s also the risk of ADP. And there&#39;s a convenience cost. For example, web access to iCloud. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Quoting from Apple&#39;s own ADP documentation</a> :</p><blockquote><p> When a user first turns on Advanced Data Protection, web access to their data at iCloud.com is automatically turned off. This is because iCloud web servers no longer have access to the keys required to decrypt and display the user&#39;s data. The user can choose to turn on web access again, and use the participation of their trusted device to access their encrypted iCloud data on the web.</p><p> After turning on web access, the user must authorize the web sign-in on one of their trusted devices each time they visit iCloud.com. The authorization “arms” the device for web access. For the next hour, this device accepts requests from specific Apple servers to upload individual service keys, but only those corresponding to an allow list of services normally accessible on iCloud.com. In other words, even after the user authorizes a web sign-in, a server request is unable to induce the user&#39;s device to upload service keys for data that isn&#39;t intended to be viewed on iCloud.com, (such as Health data or passwords in iCloud Keychain). Apple servers request only the service keys needed to decrypt the specific data that the user is requesting to access on the web. Every time a service key is uploaded, it is encrypted using an ephemeral key bound to the web session that the user authorized, and a notification is displayed on the user&#39;s device, showing the iCloud service whose data is temporarily being made available to Apple servers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s for reasons like “I lost my only device and forgot my iCloud password”, and to provide easy access to iCloud through the web, that Advanced Data Protection is not the default for all users.</p><p> I think it&#39;s technically possible that Apple could maintain “end-to-end encryption” in a pedantic sense while adding an additional UK-controlled signing key to all encrypted data in iCloud. Let&#39;s say you own two Apple devices, an iPhone and a Mac, and you use Advanced Data Protection. Your data can only be decrypted by those two devices, or by your recovery key, or by a device controlled by one of your recovery contacts. Apple could do something like add the UK government as, effectively, a recovery contact, to each and every user in the world&#39;s encrypted iCloud data. That would still be “end-to-end”, it&#39;s just that the UK government would control one of those end points. But the way iCloud security is designed, something like that cannot be added silently. When a new device is added to your iCloud account, all of your existing devices get a notification that a new device has been added. I personally see these notifications hundreds of times a year, every year, as I add new review unit devices to my account. Like back in September, I got four iPhone 16 review units, two Apple Watch review units, and purchased my own iPhone 16 Pro. And I own several Macs, several Apple Watches, and an iPad. Each one of those devices, when added to my iCloud account, even just temporarily for testing, generated a notification about the new device being added to my iCloud account to each and every one of my other devices, new or old, currently signed into my iCloud account. That&#39;s a minor annoyance for me as a product reviewer, but of course I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Apple&#39;s system is built such that new devices cannot be added to the chain without a notification being generated and sent to every existing device in your account. This notification regarding new devices happens even with standard protection — it&#39;s not exclusive to users who&#39;ve enabled ADP.</p><p> So while in theory some company could (I think?) build a system that is fairly (but deceptively) described as “end-to-end encrypted” where one of the “ends” is secretly and silently controlled by the UK government, Apple&#39;s iCloud is not such a system. Apple is prevented by UK law from explaining this, unfortunately, but I think it&#39;s true that as iCloud currently stands, Apple cannot comply with the UK&#39;s demands for ADP-protected accounts, because they can&#39;t add a UK-controlled decryption key to existing iCloud accounts without notifying every device signed into every account. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple Pulls Advanced Data Protection From the UK, in Defiance of UK Demand for Global Backdoor</title></entry><entry><title> Yankees Loosen The Boss&#39;s Facial Hair Policy </title><link href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/yankees-change-facial-hair-policy" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/yankees-facial-hair" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41595</id><published> 2025-02-21T16:10:45Z</published><updated> 2025-02-21T16:17:43Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner:</p><blockquote><p> “In recent weeks I have spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees — spanning several eras — to elicit their perspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy, and I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback. These most recent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue that dates back several years.</p><p> “Ultimately the final decision rests with me, and after great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.”</p></blockquote><p> The appropriate time to change this was years ago, but better late than never. It&#39;s the most Yankees story possible that this policy change is much bigger news than the fact that the team today also signed manager Aaron Boone to a two-year extension through the 2027 season. MLB reporter Bryan Hoch:</p><blockquote><p> The grooming policy dates to George M. Steinbrenner&#39;s purchase of the team. As the legend goes, its roots grew in 1973, when Steinbrenner observed his team on the first-base line for Opening Day against the Cleveland Indians.</p><p> Steinbrenner was not yet “The Boss,” so new in the role that he could not identify the players by their faces. Instead, he focused upon their hair — unkempt mustaches, mutton chops and shaggy locks. He scowled, scribbling uniform numbers on a scrap of paper urgently dispatched to manager Ralph Houk. Tell these men to get a haircut, Steinbrenner commanded.</p></blockquote><p> My favorite Yankee, Don Mattingly, not only ran into grief over this policy with George Steinbrenner, but <a href="https://youtu.be/BMzeznCyX8w">again with the next team he played for</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Yankees Loosen The Boss’s Facial Hair Policy’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/yankees-facial-hair">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Barbara Broccoli on Amazon, in Private: &#39;These People Are Fucking Idiots&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db?st=P86jBM&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/broccoli-amazon-idiots" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41594</id><published> 2025-02-20T19:42:32Z</published><updated> 2025-02-20T19:42:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Erich Schwartzel and Jessica Toonkel, reporting for The Wall Street Journal back on December 19, under the headline “Where Is James Bond? Trapped in an Ugly Stalemate With Amazon” ( <a href="https://apple.news/A4AvCvPCIScSH_SJzKGD7gQ">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Nearly three years after Amazon acquired the right to release Bond movies through its $6.5 billion purchase of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio, the relationship between the family that oversees the franchise and the e-commerce giant has all but collapsed. The decaying partnership has scuttled any near-term hope of a new Bond film — a black eye for Amazon&#39;s ambitions in Hollywood, since at the time of the MGM sale, the Bond franchise represented a significant share of the $6.5 billion the company paid for the studio.</p><p> When it comes to Bond&#39;s future, the power lies in the hands of Barbara Broccoli, who inherited the control from her father, Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, and who for 30 years has decided when a new Bond movie can go into production. She has told friends she doesn&#39;t trust algorithm-centric Amazon with a character she helped to mythologize through big-screen storytelling and gut instinct. This fall, she characterized the status of a new movie in dire terms — no script, no story and no new Bond.</p><p> To friends, Broccoli has characterized her thoughts on Amazon this way: “These people are fucking idiots.”</p></blockquote><p> One way out of a stalemate, apparently, is to sell. Here&#39;s Broccoli&#39;s public statement today, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/global/james-bond-amazon-mgm-gain-creative-control-1236313930/">accompanying the news</a> that Eon Productions has reached a deal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">that shifts creative control over the franchise to Amazon</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of &#39;No Time to Die&#39; and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”</p></blockquote><p> Broccoli&#39;s brother Michael Wilson was ever so slightly more magnanimous in his statement, saying “Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future,” but it&#39;s rather striking that Broccoli said not a word about Amazon in her statement, and Wilson&#39;s praise only went so far as the lone adjective <em>trusted</em> . But the lie to Wilson&#39;s attempt at even slight magnanimity is that Eon Productions and Amazon were <em>never</em> partners. It was the old MGM Studios, before Amazon&#39;s acquisition, that was Eon&#39;s partner from the very beginning ( <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/646-dr-no">1963&#39;s <em>Dr. No</em></a> ).</p><p> I meant to post a link to this WSJ story when it broke, and mistakenly thought I had, but it slipped through the cracks around the holidays.

<p>Alex Ritman, with blockbuster news at Variety:</p><blockquote><p> Amazon MGM Studios is set to take creative control of the James Bond franchise. The shock announcement — which is sure to shake and, indeed, stir the industry — was made Thursday, alongside the news that long-time producers and custodians of 007, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, would be stepping back.</p><p> As per details of the historic agreement, Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli have formed a new joint venture to house the James Bond intellectual property rights. The three parties will remain co-owners of the iconic franchise but Amazon MGM will have creative control.</p></blockquote><p> The villains in Bond stories are often bald billionaire industrialists who either build rockets or own media companies, with lasciviously-dressed women on their arms. It&#39;s hard to imagine how we could come closer to a real-life Bond villain taking control of the franchise. (At least it wasn&#39;t Musk.)</p><p> “Nepo babies” is a term that tends only to be used pejoratively, but family ownership is a proven model to nurture and maintain — to protect — exceptional companies with exceptional cultures. Berkshire Hathaway owns several where their agreements not only allowed, but encouraged, the families to maintain control post-acquisition. <a href="https://www.sees.com/about-us/sees-family">See&#39;s Candies</a> comes to mind.<a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/SpecialLetters/WEB%20past%20present%20future%202014.pdf">This letter from Warren Buffet</a> describes their strategy. But Berkshire is itself an exceptional company. Most corporate conglomerate acquisitions of creator/family-run endeavors wreak devastation upon everything that made those smaller operations unique and special. Look at what&#39;s happened to The Washington Post now that Bezos owns it. There&#39;s much to complain about The New York Times in general, and current publisher AG Sulzberger in particular (sixth generation of family control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company">since Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896</a> ), but The Times is still The Times.</p><p> Heretofore, Barbara Broccoli did that with the 007 franchise. The output was uneven under her and Wilson&#39;s producing stewardship, but the Daniel Craig era was a splendid return to form. There&#39;s no other movie franchise like it. The closest is <em>Mission Impossible</em> but that franchise is a distant second place, in my mind. It lacks a certain magic, a timeless but yet somehow always modern <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of the 007 franchise. Always the same, but somehow always fresh.</p><p> I expect Amazon to bleed it dry, alas. Spinoffs and “universe” expansion galore, of generally low quality in all regards: writing, casting, production values. But most of all I expect they&#39;ll make the same fundamental mistake Disney has made with <em>Star Wars</em> — instead of leaving us craving more, they&#39;ll produce as much dreck as they can and leave us saying “ <em>enough, stop</em> ”, with the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/330459-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story">occasional</a> <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83867-star-wars-andor">gems</a> fighting for attention in a <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/page-b4e74f38-aa35-4b12-965c-93f4a931f78a">river</a> of <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled/">downright embarrassing unwatchable crap</a> . Somehow they managed to ruin Boba Fett.</p><p> What&#39;s the best original show or movie Amazon has ever made? <em>The Peripheral</em> was pretty good but they cancelled after its first season. <em>Reacher</em> is fun but it&#39;s junk-food fun, not serious fun. Amazon taking control of James Bond is like McDonald&#39;s taking over a great steakhouse chain like <a href="https://www.delfriscos.com/location/del-friscos-double-eagle-steakhouse-philadelphia-pa/">Del Frisco&#39;s</a> .</p><p>我对此有一种不好的感觉。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Amazon MGM Studios Takes Creative Control Over James Bond Franchise’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/thoughts_and_observations_on_todays_iphone_16e_announcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3b" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41591</id><published> 2025-02-20T04:42:10Z</published><updated> 2025-02-22T01:52:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">Tim Cook teased</a> a “newest member of the family” product announcement coming today; turns out it was <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/">the iPhone 16e</a> , a device whose name briefly paralyzed me with indecision regarding how to capitalize it, <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-19">1</a></sup> which replaces the three-year-old iPhone SE (3rd generation) in the lineup.</p><h2> The Announcement</h2><p> Apple made the announcement in a 13-minute video that is currently atop their home page, but seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">only perma-linkable at YouTube</a> . (Maybe <a href="https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-16e/2025/d9015f23-5cc1-45b4-b25a-2b1caee9d7ac/films/announcement/iphone-16e-announcement-tpl-us-2025_16x9.m3u8">this</a> ?) It was also, of course, announced in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a press release on Apple Newsroom</a> . The first three minutes of the video feature Tim Cook (talking about how great iPhones are, the iPhones 16 in particular, and Apple Intelligence). Cook hands things off to iPhone product marketing VP Kaiann Drance for the next five minutes; Drance mostly recaps iOS 18&#39;s tentpole features, especially, of course, Apple Intelligence. Drance hands off to keynote first-timer (I think) Lucy Browning, a director of iPhone product design, who talks up the 16e specifics. The most unusual thing about the video is its setting: not Apple Park, not the Steve Jobs Theater, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I&amp;t=2727s">the infinite white void</a> , where, in a bygone era, Apple TV commercials like the famed Hodgman/Long “I&#39;m a Mac / I&#39;m a PC” series were set. (The new infinite void is arguably light gray, not white.)</p><h2> The Name</h2><p> First, the name. It&#39;s not the fourth-generation iPhone SE, and instead sports an altogether new “e” suffix. Apple has used an “S” suffix with the iPhones 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS; “C” with the iPhone 5C, and “R” with the XR. We shall see if this “e” is a one-off. In an online press briefing today, when asked whether the “e” stands for anything, an Apple rep said no, it does not stand for anything, but that it&#39;s built for everyone. I don&#39;t think she meant to imply that the “e” secretly stands for <em>everyone</em> , if only because I&#39;m pretty sure Apple doesn&#39;t want everyone buying the lowest-price iPhone model. Apple never had an explanation for the “SE” name either, although in my head I&#39;ve already read that as maybe sorta kinda standing for <em>special edition</em> ? Way back in the day, I think Phil Schiller once said the “S” in “iPhone 3GS” stood for <em>speed</em> , because the 3GS was in fact strikingly faster than the prior year&#39;s 3G, and the “C” in “iPhone 5C” definitely, if unofficially, stood for <em>color</em> . But it&#39;s best not to waste too much time trying to find any logic to this other than that Apple thinks “iPhone 16e” looks and sounds cool. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not the “iPhone 16 AI”.</p><p> Using the “16” generation as part of the name is more interesting than the new “e” suffix. It perhaps suggests that e-edition phones might become annual. I wouldn&#39;t bet on that. But the SE models came out in March 2016, April 2020, and March 2022, so the gaps have been irregular. At the very least though, the 16e name will help make it clear, in years to come, what the basic specs of this iPhone were and when, roughly, it debuted. Every time I&#39;ve referenced the third-gen SE in the last year or two, I&#39;ve had to look up exactly when it debuted and which A-series chip it sported (A15, same as the iPhone 13).</p><h2>定价</h2><p>As expected, the existing third-gen iPhone SE is now out of the lineup. The third-gen SE debuted in March 2022 with a starting price of $430 (for a paltry 64 GB) with 128 and 256 GB configurations for, respectively, $480 and $580. The new iPhone 16e starts at $600, which, depending on how you look at it, is either a $170 increase (in the price of the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells) or a $120 increase (in the price of the cheapest 128 GB iPhone Apple sells). I&#39;ve already seen gobs of people arguing that the iPhone 16e “should” start at just $500, but if you look at Apple&#39;s pricing for the entire iPhone 16 lineup, there are $200 gaps, for the same storage tiers, between the 16e and regular 16, and between the regular 16 and 16 Pro. So I&#39;d argue that $600 is the “right” price. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39;s inflation calculator</a> , $500 in January 2022 is about $565 in January 2025 dollars.</p><p> Here&#39;s a table with the lineup of new iPhones Apple currently sells. I&#39;m including the now-discontinued iPhone SE for reference. Also note that while these are the only models Apple itself sells to consumers, other old models are still sold by various carriers and retail partners around the world, including the iPhone SE for now. </p><table class="table-5EE26071-E20E-463E-860C-F4FEB8AD1841" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The 16e does support inductive Qi charging, but only at a pokey 7.5-watt rate. The regular 16 and 16 Pro models support MagSafe charging at up to 25 watts, and the iPhone 15 at 15 watts. You can charge an iPhone 16e using a MagSafe charging puck, but only at 7.5 watts, and it won&#39;t magnetically snap into place. It&#39;ll just function as a non-magnetic pad. I don&#39;t know if this decision was about component pricing (the $200 difference has to come from somewhere, and it&#39;s not going to be Apple&#39;s margins), the internal space that MagSafe components occupy in the device (see next section), or marketing differentiation. Probably some combination of all three. The old SE only supported 7.5-watt no-MagSafe Qi charging as well.</p><h2>电池</h2><p>Battery life is better than the regular iPhone 16. This is equally surprising to me. From Apple&#39;s own Comparison page:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png" class="noborder"><img
    src   = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Apple's comparison of battery life specs between the iPhone 16 Pro, 16, and 16e."
    width = 525
  /></a></p><p> How exactly is the 16e achieving battery life that surpasses the more expensive iPhone 16, and is effectively on par with the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro? I suspect it&#39;s a combination of a larger battery and a more efficient cellular modem. As rumored, the 16e is Apple&#39;s first iPhone with an in-house–designed modem, which, in the video, Kaiann Drance introduces thus (emphasis added): “And with iPhone 16e, we&#39;re expanding the benefits of Apple silicon with C1, the first Apple-designed cellular modem. It provides fast and reliable 5G connectivity, and <em>it&#39;s the most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone</em> .” Just as with CPUs and GPUs, Apple&#39;s interest in custom silicon isn&#39;t only about price and performance — it&#39;s about efficiency too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=199">Drance then continues</a> (speaking over a cool breakaway animation of the 16e&#39;s internal components), “We combined the incredible power efficiency of Apple silicon with an all-new internal design for iPhone 16e that has been optimized for a larger battery. Together, it paves the way for an unprecedented level of battery life in a 6.1-inch iPhone.” There might be other changes that allow the 16e to accommodate a larger battery than the regular 16, but from the spec sheet, the obvious one is the omission of MagSafe.</p><h2> Apple&#39;s C1 Chip</h2><p> The power efficiency sounds great, and of course the modem supports “5G”, but it doesn&#39;t support mmWave / ultra wideband, the crazy super-fast variant of 5G with Wi-Fi-like speed <em>and</em> Wi-Fi-like short range from carrier antennas that serve it. Block-by-block here at home in Philadelphia, I see ultra wideband from Verizon on some blocks of the city ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118203">denoted by the “5G UW” icon in the status bar</a> ), but not most. But do I really care? I honestly don&#39;t know why I&#39;m supposed to care about 5G at all compared to LTE. Using LTE instead of 5G (let alone 5G ultra wideband) makes no practical difference for anything I do over cellular on my phone. Obviously Apple wants to support ultra wideband in its own modems eventually, but their renewed deal with Qualcomm — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">announced and crowed-about only by Qualcomm</a> , because Apple despises them and deeply resents its own dependence upon them — covers “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026”. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a C-series chip in this September&#39;s expected iPhone 17 or 17 Pro — but perhaps we&#39;ll see one in the rumored iPhone 17 “Air”.</p><p> Remember too that when last I saw it tested — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">by Nicole Nguyen in 2022</a> — disabling 5G and exclusively using LTE extended the battery life of an iPhone 13 Pro from 13 to 15.5 hours in her video-streaming test. Ultra wideband 5G <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">is indeed insanely fast</a> , and regular 5G is generally faster than LTE, but for most people in most places not in ways that practically matter, especially considering the effects on battery life. “Plenty fast enough, with longer battery life” is a better trade-off than “way faster than you&#39;ll notice, with somewhat shorter battery life”.</p><p> Speaking of wireless, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the C1 chip, but the iPhone 16e supports only Wi-Fi 6, not 7, and doesn&#39;t support Thread networking.</p><h2> Just One Camera on the Back, but It&#39;s “2-in-1”</h2><p> No surprise here — cameras are expensive, and only offering one makes for very obvious differentiation. Apple&#39;s calling this lone camera “2-in-1” because, like the main camera on other recent iPhone models, it offers both 1× and 2× <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6110937480">optical fields of view</a> (1× uses the entire 48MP sensor, producing a 12MP image by treating the sensor pixel array as “quad pixels; 2× produces 12MP images by cropping the center 12MP of the sensor). The lack of a second ultra-wide camera means not just no 0.5× lens, but also no macro photography, and no spatial photos or video. The 16e also offers only “Photographic Styles”, not the “latest-generation Photographic Styles” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16#photography">offered by the 16 and 16 Pro</a> .</p><p> If you really care about your <em>camera</em> , the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t the iPhone for you. As mentioned above, it has fewer lenses and the imaging pipeline doesn&#39;t support the next-generation Photographic Styles (which, five months in, I continue to really enjoy in my own photography). But that doesn&#39;t mean the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t a valid choice for people who care about their photos. Some people really do care about their photography, but also really just point and shoot using their main 1× camera, no matter which iPhone model they own. Not worrying about camera hardware and only concerning yourself with lighting and framing is a philosophy shared by many seriously talented photographers.</p><h2> No Camera Control Button</h2><p> The other camera-hardware-related ding against the 16e is that it doesn&#39;t have the new Camera Control button/slider on the side. I know several iPhone 16 owners who claim they never use it or even flat out dislike it, because they find themselves invoking it only by accident. I really like it, and use it as my primary way to launch the Camera app and to capture images. But, you know, we all captured images and videos just fine for 17 iPhone generations without that hardware button. No matter how much you like it, you certainly don&#39;t need it.</p><p> But, up until now, you <em>did</em> need the Camera Control button to invoke <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-visual-intelligence-with-camera-control-iph12eb1545e/ios">the visual intelligence feature of Apple Intelligence</a> . A press-and-release of Camera Control launches your favorite camera app; a long-press invokes visual intelligence. Apple&#39;s solution to enable visual intelligence on the iPhone 16e, despite it lacking the Camera Control button, is two-fold. First, visual intelligence is now available in Control Center. Second, as demonstrated by Apple in the announcement video, you can assign the Action Button to visual intelligence. (By default, just as with other iPhones equipped with the Action Button, it defaults to toggling silent mode, like the dedicated ringer switch of yore — where by “yore” I mean still on the iPhone 15.)</p><p> Apple representatives also told me today that owners of the iPhone 15 Pro will soon be able to bind their Action Button to visual intelligence, “in a future software update”. I suspect that future software update is iOS 18.4, which should be launching in beta any day now, but Apple wouldn&#39;t comment, on or off the record, when exactly this feature will come to the iPhone 15 Pro. They also confirmed that the Control Center button to launch visual intelligence is also coming to iPhone 15 Pro (and presumably iPhone 16 models, too). The iPhone 15 Pro, despite qualifying for Apple Intelligence, has heretofore lacked the visual intelligence feature, because the visual intelligence feature has only been trigger-able via the Camera Control button. It&#39;s a little odd, frankly, that Apple didn&#39;t enable this feature via the Action Button and Control Center for 15 Pro users months ago — perhaps they really wanted to wait for the 16e announcement?</p><h2>展示</h2><p>The 16e display specs seem pretty good, but the front sensor array is behind a notch, not a dynamic island. That&#39;s a reasonable design trade-off for the lowest-price model. The 16 and 16 Pro displays offer maximum brightness specs of 1,000 nits (typical), 1,600 nits (HDR), and 2,000 nits (outdoor). The 16e display offers 800 nits (typical), 1,200 (HDR), and doesn&#39;t go higher than that. The 16 and 16 Pro dislays also go down to just 1 nit minimum brightness; Apple doesn&#39;t list a minimum brightness for the 16e display.</p><h2>硅</h2><p>The A18 chip in the iPhone 16e seems (on the specs page) nearly identical to that of the iPhone 16, except for the number of GPU cores: the 16e has only 4 GPU cores, but the regular iPhone 16 has 5. (The A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max has 6 GPU cores.) No big whoop.</p><p> What&#39;s more interesting than comparing to the iPhone 16 is comparing to the iPhone 15, which costs $100 more than the 16e. Because the only A17-generation chip was the A17 Pro that went into the iPhone 15 Pro models, the regular iPhone 15 has the same A16 chip from the iPhone 14 model year. Aside from all the general performance improvements in the A18 compared to the two-year-old A16, the big functional difference is that the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 15 does not. As covered extensively when Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC last June, that&#39;s mainly a function of RAM, but whatever the reasons, the less expensive iPhone 16e has Apple Intelligence, and the iPhone 15 does not. Maybe that&#39;s not a <em>big</em> whoop, but it&#39;s definitely a whoop of some sort.</p><p> Perhaps, like the three generations of SE models, the iPhone 16e is designed to stay around for several years at this price point. If it does, the fact that it costs $100 less than the “year-old regular iPhone” will make more sense come September, when that $700 year-old model is the iPhone 16. But until September, the iPhone 16e looks like a better phone in several ways than the iPhone 15. It has a faster chip that supports Apple Intelligence and significantly longer battery life. The iPhone 15 does have a 0.5× ultra-wide camera, and it has a slightly better display (that includes the nicer dynamic island instead of a notch). And of course the iPhone 15 comes in colors like pink, yellow, green, and blue. But if you keep your phone in a case all the time, like most people do, you probably don&#39;t care about the color of your phone much. The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less.</p><h2>颜色</h2><p>You can get any color 16e that you want, so long as it&#39;s black or white. The third-gen iPhone SE came in midnight, starlight, and Product Red. (Is Apple done partnering with Product Red now? I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-marks-world-aids-day-with-red/">Apple Watch Series 9 was the last device offered with Product Red</a> .)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-19"><p> For a while with the iPhone 4S, there was some ambiguity whether Apple intended the “S” to be upper- or lowercase, because their marketing materials used a small-cap “S”, and a small-cap “S” looks almost exactly like a lowercase “s”. They settled on uppercase for the 4S. But when the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, Apple not only styled both of those suffixes lowercase, they retroactively re-styled the &#39;S&#39; in the &#39;4S&#39; as lowercase. I wrote about this at length <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">in this footnote in my iPhone 5S and 5C review in 2013</a> , in which I explained my decision to uppercase them. But I sort of like the way “16e” looks. It&#39;s ... friendly? And the lowercase “e” carries the correct implication that this is a lesser sibling to the regular iPhone 16, not an upgrade or superior of some sort. So for now, I&#39;m going with the flow and keeping the “e” lowercase. One friend, to whom I vented my consternation regarding how to handle this, unhelpfully suggested I go with <em>iPhone 16ᵉ</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Thoughts and Observations on Today&#39;s iPhone 16e Announcement</title></entry><entry><title> &#39;Oh, the Humane-ity&#39; </title><link href="https://spyglass.org/humane-ai-pin-strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/oh-the-humane-ity" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41590</id><published> 2025-02-19T16:48:23Z</published><updated> 2025-02-19T16:48:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

It&#39;s a fire sale for a company that has been under duress for months after their product, the Ai Pin, failed to catch fire in the market. Actually, that&#39;s not technically true.

<p>From Humane&#39;s “AI Pin Consumers FAQ”, which <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers">they link to</a> with one of the best euphemisms of the year thus far — “We understand this transition may be difficult, and you may have questions”:</p><blockquote><p> Key Dates to Remember:</p><ul><li> <em>Effective immediately</em> : Ai Pin is no longer available for new purchases.</li><li> <em>February 28, 2025 at 12pm PST</em> : Ai Pin devices will no longer connect to Humane&#39;s servers, and .Center access will be fully retired.</li><li> <em>February 28, 2025 at 12pm PST</em> : All customer data, including personal identifiable information (PII), will be permanently deleted from Humane&#39;s servers.</li></ul></blockquote><p> This was a $700 purchase (for the matte black base model — polished metal ones were $800) with a mandatory $24/month service charge (which included cellular networking) and extra battery “boosters” were $70. Customers who bought when it launched last April have spent at least $1,000, but probably more, all told. Humane gave them 10 days notice before the thing turns into a brick.</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will I receive a refund for my Ai Pin?</em></p><p> Refunds are only available for customers who are still within the 90-day return window from their original shipment date. You are eligible to receive a refund if your product shipped on or after November 15th, 2024. All device shipments prior to November 15th, 2024 are not eligible for refunds. All refunds must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.</p></blockquote><p> Translation: tough shit.</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will my Ai Pin work with another cellular provider after the shutdown?</em></p><p> No. Once the service is discontinued, your Ai Pin will no longer function as a cellular device or connect to Humane&#39;s servers. This means no calls, texts, or data usage will be possible. [...]</p><p> <em>Can I still use my Ai Pin for offline features?</em></p><p>是的。 After February 28, 2025, Ai Pin will still allow for offline features like battery level, etc., but will not include any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access.</p></blockquote><p> You can check the battery of a device that no longer offers any useful functionality. I get it, companies go bust, and when they go bust, their services go bust with them. But this is exactly the sort of outcome that made Humane&#39;s AI Pin seem more like a scam than a product all along.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘When ‘FAQ’ Stands for ‘Fucking Angry Questions’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/humane-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> We Found the Sucker Willing to Buy Humane, and as Promised, I&#39;m Going to Be Insufferable, Because of Course It Was HP </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/hp-116-million-deal-for-humane-includes-ip-but-no-ai-pin-device" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w38" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41588</id><published> 2025-02-18T22:42:14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-18T22:49:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Brody Ford, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> HP Inc. will acquire assets from Humane Inc., the maker of a wearable Ai Pin introduced in late 2023, for $116 million.</p><p> The deal will include the majority of Humane&#39;s employees in addition to its software platform and intellectual property, the company said Tuesday. It will not include Humane&#39;s Ai pin device business, which will be wound down, an HP spokesperson said.</p><p> Humane&#39;s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate artificial intelligence into the company&#39;s personal computers, printers and connected conference rooms, said Tuan Tran, who leads HP&#39;s AI initiatives. Chaudhri and Bongiorno were design and software engineers at Apple Inc. before founding the startup.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale">Yours truly, last May</a> , when news broke that Humane was looking for a buyer, “seeking a price of between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale”:</p><blockquote><p> I suspect they&#39;ll sell for a pittance — way less than the $230 million they&#39;ve raised. I just don&#39;t see what they have to offer. Humane doesn&#39;t own the AI that powers the AI Pin — that comes from OpenAI, which seemingly not only doesn&#39;t want to buy Humane, but is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893939/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence-device">supposedly in exploratory talks</a> with Jony Ive&#39;s LoveFrom to design and build their own AI devices. The laser projector idea seems to be a bust, and the hardware&#39;s battery life is measured in hours between battery pack swaps.</p><p> Off the top of my head, the only company that could afford a $1 billion-ish price for Humane <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/304397/the-hp-autonomy-lawsuit-timeline-of-an-ma-disaster.html">is dumb enough</a> to do it is HP.</p></blockquote><p> Well, at least we can say HP was smart enough not to spend $1 billion on this. But they were dumb enough to bring into their company Chaudhri, who was described to me, by someone who worked with him at Apple (and a person whom I&#39;ve never heard badmouth a single other former colleague), as “an utter fraud”. But a fraud whose <a href="http://www.imranchaudhri.com/">personal website</a> is an inadvertent testimony to the lunacy of the US patent system — that it serves ego inflation, not innovation.</p><p>但是谁知道？ Maybe I&#39;m all wet and Humane will prove to HP what NeXT proved to Apple, and we&#39;ll all be hanging on every thread of Imran Chaudhri keynotes in a few years and he&#39;ll lead HP back to greatness.

<p>You saw the news last week, I&#39;m sure, that both of the major mapping-app providers, Google and Apple, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">have updated their maps to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”</a> . Microsoft&#39;s Bing Maps, which I would describe as a minor provider, has made the change too. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-17">1</a></sup> It&#39;s all actually quite a bit more complicated than “they renamed the Gulf of Mexico”, but bear with me for now.</p><p> You&#39;ve also seen, I&#39;m equally sure, a lot of people angry at Google and Apple for going along with this. That anger is — to some degree — misplaced. I get where the anger comes from, but it&#39;s still misplaced. My initial take, right in the midst of Trump&#39;s inauguration speech on January 20, was that if he went through with it, Apple and Google and everyone else who publishes maps should just ignore it. Trump, obviously, did go through with it: the United States Geological Survey, an agency within the Department of the Interior, which is within the executive branch and thus under the president&#39;s purview, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/gulf-america">officially made the change on February 7</a> . Now that it&#39;s official US government policy, “just ignore it” really isn&#39;t feasible. If that&#39;s still your stance, I implore you to consider at least a bit more nuance.</p><p> But let&#39;s first stipulate up front that there are multiple far more important and urgent issues facing the United States and the world, just four short weeks into the Trump 2.0 administration. Off the top of my head: Ukraine, Gaza, tariffs, DOGE, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/nyregion/scotten-letter.html?unlocked_article_code=1.w04.Lkj2.Tu4sBTtDGwqQ&amp;smid=url-share">the rule of law</a> . Whether you approve or disapprove of Trump&#39;s actions on any or all of those issues, there should be no question that all of them are important and consequential. The name we see on maps for a body of water, not as much. But it&#39;s the smallness, the relative unimportance, the spiteful pettiness of the renaming in the first place — down to the fact that until Trump&#39;s executive action, there was no controversy, <em>zero</em> , <em>none</em> , <em>nada</em> , anywhere in the world, amongst any group of people, regarding the name of the Gulf of Mexico — that makes it interesting to examine in detail how Google and Apple have chosen to deal with it. It&#39;s only because this particular issue is so spectacularly piddling that we can consider it in full.</p><p> The motivation behind the name change is simple as well. Trump didn&#39;t change the US&#39;s officially recognized name of, say, the Atlantic Ocean or the continent of Africa. He just as easily could, but he won&#39;t. And it&#39;s not like “Gulf of Mexico” was on a list of “debatable or controversial names” until he created this controversy out of thin air. It&#39;s just the one name on the globe that a president of the United States can change to stick it to Mexico, a country Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/judge-curiel-trump-border-wall/index.html">has objectively racist feelings toward</a> . Trump never campaigned on building a wall at our <em>northern</em> border with Canada, nor has he (yet?) attempted to rename Lake Ontario. It&#39;s about Mexico, and asserting power by fiat. Trump has a lifelong history of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trump-in-name-only-how-investors-lost-millions-buying-into-t">putting his name on buildings he doesn&#39;t own</a> . He&#39;d rather have his name emblazoned on a building he doesn&#39;t own than own a building that doesn&#39;t bear his name. To Trump, the name on the sign is more important than the deed. So too, now, with the name on a map. The Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water that belongs to no nation, but declaring this new name implies that it heretofore belonged to Mexico, and now belongs to us, which is to say belongs to him, our unquestioned dear leader. That Trump took it from Mexico, without firing a shot — when in fact all he did was order a string to be changed in a government database. Shakespeare would have us believe that a sea by any other name would taste as salty. Trump doesn&#39;t read Shakespeare.</p><h2> How Google and Apple Are Labelling the Gulf, Globally</h2><p> The first important thing to know is that Google Maps and Apple Maps are not singular global atlases. They both show different names (and in rare cases, different geographies) in different regions around the world. They each are more like a collection of regional atlases. In constrast, there&#39;s only one <a href="https://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a> . If the OED changes a word&#39;s definition, or adds a new word, those changes appear to everyone in the world. My OED is your OED, no matter where you and I live or currently find ourselves on the globe. Google and Apple Maps aren&#39;t like that. It&#39;s better to think of them as services that provide region-by-region maps.</p><p> Google, to their credit, has a blog post <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">describing and illustrating exactly what users around the world now see in Google Maps</a> :</p><blockquote><p> In the US, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) has officially <a href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730">updated</a> “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” As we <a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951">announced</a> two weeks ago and consistent with our longstanding practices, we&#39;ve begun rolling out changes to reflect this update. People using Maps in the US will see “Gulf of America,” and people in Mexico will see “Gulf of Mexico.”其他所有人都会看到两个名字。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/google-maps-gulf.png">As their illustration shows</a> , “both names” means putting “Gulf of America” in parentheses for users who are anywhere else in the world other than the US or Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</p><p> Apple&#39;s approach has been more Apple-like, which is to say without comment. They made no public comment before changing the name in Apple Maps, and they have made no public comment since. (I&#39;ve asked Apple PR for comment, but gotten none.) I&#39;d appreciate a statement, like Google&#39;s, stating what users around the world should expect to see. But I also understand their desire to say as little as possible. In a sense, the labels on Apple Maps speak for themselves, and are the only thing that actually matters. I also appreciate, that by never declaring a policy on the matter, Apple can change its map labels without rescinding or amending a policy.</p><p> So without a statement from Apple describing how the Gulf is labelled around the world, I did what I could: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114003192100392251">I asked my followers on Mastodon who are outside the US what they saw as the Gulf&#39;s name</a> , and to include screenshots if possible. That was on Friday, 14 February, after Apple Maps began showing “Gulf of America” in place of “Gulf of Mexico” to users here in the US. The response was overwhelming, with replies from people in over two dozen countries from around the world. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-17">2</a></sup> And at the time, their replies suggested that Apple was taking a subtly but intriguingly different approach from Google. To wit, while everyone in the US saw “Gulf of America” (with no mention of the established name), everyone everywhere else in the world still saw “Gulf of Mexico” (or their language&#39;s translation of that name), with no mention, in parentheses or otherwise, of the new name now recognized by the United States.</p><p> I hoped that that was Apple&#39;s plan, which would have been quietly subversive in isolating the United States as the only country in the world to even see the name “Gulf of America”. But I feared that Apple was simply slower than Google, that changes had been applied for users in the US first, but changes for the rest of the world simply hadn&#39;t propagated. My fears were warranted.</p><p> Late in the evening (US Eastern Time) on Saturday, 15 February, new responses to my entreaty on Mastodon began showing labels in Apple Maps that matched Google&#39;s:</p><ul><li> In the US: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> In Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> I believe that the determining factor for what label you see, at least for Apple Maps, is unrelated to your physical location as determined by GPS or your IP address, but simply the region setting of your OS. On both MacOS and iOS, that&#39;s in Settings → General → Language &amp; Region → Region. This makes sense — you can use Apple Maps (and Google Maps) with Location Services turned off. You can play with this setting on your device to see what users around the world see in Maps without leaving your home, and without changing your device&#39;s language. Thus, if you&#39;re an American with your device set to the “United States” region, if you travel outside the US without changing your device settings, you&#39;ll still see the US-specific new name for the gulf: “Gulf of America”, with its historic and world-recognized name — dare I say, its unambiguously <em>correct</em> name — not even referenced in parentheses.</p><h2> The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment</h2><p> This whole thing, needless to say, sucks. It&#39;s profoundly stupid, and the aspects that aren&#39;t stupid are jingoistic. But the notion that Google or Apple might reasonably just ignore this and tell Trump (and the entire Republican Party, and their supporters) to go pound sand is facile. I&#39;m not saying they <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do it. Of course they <em>could</em> . That&#39;s like saying Trump <em>can&#39;t</em> just declare a new name for an international body of water with a heretofore uncontroversial 400-year-old name.</p><p> But it wouldn&#39;t be reasonable. It is reasonable for Google and Apple Maps to defer to, or at least acknowledge, the officially recognized names for each region in which they&#39;re available. It&#39;s not Google&#39;s or Apple&#39;s place to determine and adjudicate the official names on a map; their job is to recognize and display those names. In theory Google and/or Apple <em>could</em> position themselves as a global authoritative reference for geographic names. To be to maps something akin to the OED or Merriam-Webster to the English language. But if they were to pursue that route they&#39;d put themselves in the position of adjudicating any and all controversies and disputes over names and borders. Civic government is where we should <em>want</em> such disputes arbitrated, if not resolved. Not by private companies. If Apple Maps is to be available in China, Apple Maps needs to present names and borders ( <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">and even the size of land masses</a> — more on this below) that are amenable to the Chinese government. China sticks out because their demands are in stark contrast to the names and borders recognized by the rest of the world. Chinese maps are governed by CCP-mandated dogma. Most maps are governed by geographic and geopolitical reality. Taiwan, for example, is in fact an independent nation. Chinese maps (including those served by Apple to mainland Chinese users) label Taiwan as a province of China.</p><p> Now the United States is governed by another such dogma-driven regime.</p><p> In theory, maps ought not be political. In practice, they are and always have been. In theory, reasonable decisions and objectively correct decisions are one and the same when it comes to cartography. In practice, politics intercedes and they conflict. You can argue (and many people are) that Google and Apple should stick with the 400-year-old, recognized-the-world-over, and heretofore uncontroversial name “Gulf of Mexico”, and apply it globally. To simply ignore the new officially-recognized name of the gulf by the United States government. They <em>could</em> do that.如果他们这样做的话，没有人会去监狱。不会有罚款。但是要付出代价。毫无疑问，忽略了美国政府认可的新“美国湾”名称。 Republicans started to complain <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dan-crenshaw-complains-to-tim-cook-that-apple-maps-hasn-t-changed-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america/ar-AA1xIK2t">that Apple Maps hadn&#39;t adopted the new name</a> three weeks ago, before the change was even made official in the government&#39;s GNIS reference database.</p><p> To ignore political reality is to court political controversy.这不符合大型跨国公司的利益。 But it&#39;s not possible to <em>avoid</em> controversy. What is reasonable is to minimize controversy. There&#39;s a famous quote from Michael Jordan, when he declined to publicly endorse the Democratic challenger to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/08/29/jesse-helms-white-racist/42090cb6-2e9b-4b13-a820-2a9b74c88fbe/">unabashedly racist</a> Republican Jesse Helms in the 1990 North Carolina Senate race: “ <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29130478/michael-jordan-stands-firm-republicans-buy-sneakers-too-quote-says-was-made-jest">Republicans buy sneakers, too.</a>透明</p><p>Some might say “That&#39;s the problem with capitalism.” I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s one of the <em>benefits</em> of capitalism.除非您认为极端两极分化是为社会服务的，否则您希望看到非政治性的主要机构。 For-profit corporations naturally serve that role. Yes, there&#39;s a profit motive. Republicans don&#39;t just buy sneakers, they buy phones and conduct web searches too. But who wants to see a world where everything is polarized politically, where every retailer, every device maker, every online service provider, every restaurant, every single thing you do, buy, or visit, is viewed through a polarized political prism? That way lies madness.</p><p> Most Americans, and most people in the western world, are beyond exhausted by our current levels of societal polarization. Escalating tensions further is not just contrary to the bottom-line interests of Apple and Google, it&#39;s in none of our interests. People just want good accurate maps. They don&#39;t want to choose — or worse, to be forced to choose — between right-leaning maps and left-leaning maps.</p><p> So if your argument is that neither Apple nor Google should be showing the name “Gulf of America” to anyone, anywhere, I&#39;m with you that that&#39;s the correct cartographical stance.但这将构成政治上的渎职行为。 Maps are important services to both companies, but the editorial integrity of their maps isn&#39;t close to their primary business or purpose. Maps aren&#39;t to Google or Apple what the English language is to the OED or Merriam-Webster. (Or what the news is to, say, the Associated Press. Hold that thought.)</p><p> So whether Google and Apple should show the new name at all shouldn&#39;t be the question we&#39;re asking. The right question is necessarily more nuanced: Who should see which names, where? And Google and Apple&#39;s answers to <em>that</em> question are, alas, disappointing and worrisome. I&#39;ll repeat the seemingly identical policy both companies are <em>actually</em> presenting today, by region:</p><ul><li> United States: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> The best politically realistic option they could have chosen would be (I&#39;ll use italics to emphasize that these are my own suggestions):</p><ul><li> <em>United States: “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”</em> .</li><li> <em>Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico”</em> .</li></ul><p> There&#39;s no good reason to even show “Gulf of America” in parentheses outside the US. We&#39;re the ones with the stupid name change on the books, so we&#39;re the ones who should get stuck seeing the stupid name. No one else should suffer the consequences of our political idiocy. But it <em>is</em> correct to show us, in America, the new dumb “Gulf of America” name. Again, if it were up to me, American users would see “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”, and everyone else would just see “Gulf of Mexico”. But that&#39;s surely the best we in the reality-based community could hope for.</p><p> It&#39;s absurd that users here in the US no longer see “Gulf of Mexico” at all. You can search for that term, and the “Gulf of America” will be the first result, but the 400-year-old name “Gulf of Mexico” no longer appears as a label on maps to US-region users for either Google Maps or Apple Maps. In any even vaguely reasonable political climate, even those in favor of the name change would endorse, perhaps even insist upon, a transitional period where the previous, familiar name appears in parentheses. Insisting that the name be changed in a snap, with no parenthetical reference to the previous name (a name that, again, has been recognized globally for over 400 years, and remains on every single printed map in existence, and every single work of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-old-man-and-the-sea-the-hemingway-library-edition-ernest-hemingway/15532053?ean=9781476787848&amp;next=t&amp;next=t">literature</a> and history referencing the Gulf) has some truly Orwellian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a> vibes. We&#39;ve always been at war with Eastasia. It&#39;s always been the Gulf of America.</p><p>美国的政治权利经常利用“<a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/snowflake/">雪花</a>”一词来暗示左边的人微妙而脆弱。但是，反对“墨西哥湾（墨西哥湾）”作为地图标签似乎肯定是雪花。棍子和石头可能会折断他们的骨头，但是历史上准确的括号地图标签会伤害他们吗？ Food for thought as you enjoy your <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/congress-french-freedom-fries-iraq/">freedom fries</a> .</p><p> Consider the simple premise that a map ought to make sense to someone who doesn&#39;t follow current events.这应该是毫无争议的。但是对于过去两个月中没有新闻的人来说，这种变化似乎令人困惑。更糟糕的是，这是一种误导。 There&#39;s no reason for most people even to suspect, let alone know, that both Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and labels.总的来说，美国人倾向于是狭och的。 Showing Americans the name “Gulf of America”, without “(Gulf of Mexico)” strongly implies that this is now the new world-recognized name, when in the fact the truth is quite the opposite: it&#39;s a name recognized by one and only one country. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-17">3</a></sup></p><p> Not showing the new name, at all, to Americans would be unreasonably provocative to the Trump administration and its supporters.但是向世界上每个地区展示新名称，但墨西哥本身对特朗普及其支持者来说是不必要的。 And making Mexico an exception to global naming policy isn&#39;t an honor or a favor to them — it&#39;s an implied insult. It insinuates that there&#39;s something wrong with them, too, legitimizing the notion that outside the US Trumpist right, there&#39;s a legitimate debate about the Gulf&#39;s name. The implied message is “ <em>Here you go, you delicate idiots, we&#39;ll make you the second of only two nations in the world regarding the displayed name of this body of water — you, and the United States.</em> ” Mexico neither asked for nor provoked any of this. (Mexico only achieved independence from Spain in 1821; the “Gulf of Mexico” name is twice as old as Mexico as a nation, and at least 150 years older than the United States.)</p><p> There are numerous countries where Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and differing disputed borders ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/9wq9vf/why_is_there_no_border_on_google_maps_between/">or lack thereof</a> ). From <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/">a 2020 report in The Washington Post</a> :</p><blockquote><p> And the line in Western Sahara marking the northern border with Morocco disappears for Moroccans seeking it out on the Web — along with the region&#39;s name altogether. The sparsely populated northwest Africa region is disputed between Morocco, which seized it in 1975, and the indigenous Sahrawi.</p><p> Sometimes that flies in the face of international consensus. Google Maps users inside Turkey can find the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or TRNC, represented in the northern third of the Mediterranean island nation. The territory is not recognized by the United Nations, nor Google&#39;s mapping competitors.</p></blockquote><p> There are other places around the world where Apple and Google show downright crazy or incorrect things on maps. The latter have one thing in common: they are to comply with the demands of countries governed by thin-skinned autocratic men who surround themselves with sycophants. As mentioned above, in China, Taiwan <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/fact-check-apple-maps-taiwan-03072024174451.html">is falsely labelled as a province of China in Apple Maps</a> . <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-17">4</a></sup> (Google Maps, like Google services generally, aren&#39;t available in China.) In 2021, in a report for The Information headlined “ <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">Inside Tim Cook&#39;s Secret $275 Billion Deal with Chinese Authorities</a> ”, Wayne Ma reported:</p><blockquote><p> Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China&#39;s State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu Islands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from them. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn&#39;t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.</p><p>该团队的一些成员最初在加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺的苹果总部回到了需求。但是地图应用程序已成为苹果公司的优先事项，因此最终该公司遵守了。当中国大陆的苹果地图中观看时，杜尤亚群岛（Diaoyu Islands）的出现比周围地区更大。</p></blockquote><p>您将站在坚定的地面上，批评苹果对中国对此的要求。 But the root problem clearly isn&#39;t Apple. It&#39;s that China is governed by communist authoritarians, and authoritarianism warps minds — including those of the authoritarian leaders themselves. You know what no one says? “ <em>The leadership of China is completely sane and sensible, and their edicts are based on reality, not dogma.</em>透明</p><p>If you don&#39;t see that Trump&#39;s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is on the same spectrum of nuttiness, then your mind, at least on this matter, has been warped. We can argue how far along that spectrum this “Gulf of America” thing is, but the only reasonable debate is of matters of degree. Apple and Google&#39;s decision to show this made-up name in parentheses to everyone around the world is akin to showing China&#39;s fictionally inflated size of the Diaoyu Islands to everyone in the world, as, say, a dotted outline surrounding the geographically accurate representations of the actual islands&#39; sizes.这个东西有一个词，这个词是<em>宣传</em>。</p><p>想象一下，如果法国政府命令英国频道现在是“法国频道”。 Now imagine that Google and Apple Maps complied, even just to the degree of changing the label, <em>outside</em> France (which, per their company policies, should see “French Channel”) and the United Kingdom (which would still see only “English Channel”) to show the rest of the world, including us in the United States, “English Channel (French Channel)”.这将被认为是侮辱性的。</p><p> The only difference from my hypothetical and our reality with the Gulf of Mexico is that France, in addition to not having a narcissistic would-be autocrat as its president ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-gets-new-government-after-weeks-uncertainty-2024-09-21/">yet</a> ?), is not the world&#39;s lone remaining superpower.这就是使Google和Apple的默许令人担忧的原因，而不仅仅是令人讨厌。 As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamellebouie.net/post/3lia22gxsgk24">pithily observed over the weekend</a> , on Bluesky, “My take is that your willingness to accept this Gulf of America nonsense is an indicator of your willingness to accept much worse things coming from this administration.”</p><p> Google和Apple自然应该努力实现的微积分是在两个轴之间找到正确的平衡。 One axis is integrity: both the cartographic integrity of the labels on the companies&#39; maps, and the institutional integrity — <em>dignity</em> even — of the companies themselves.全球数十亿人信任Google和Apple。他们对这个映射问题的决定 - 无论事物的宏伟计划多么微不足道 - 都应该加强而不是侵蚀这种信任。</p><p>另一个轴是最小化争议。</p><p> Simply maximizing integrity — by ignoring the “Gulf of America” name completely — would incur volcanic controversy within the United States. This calculated balance is behind my suggestion of showing “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” within the United States, and showing just “Gulf of Mexico” everywhere else.也许在括号内包含了长期名称，对于吃肉食的共和党人来说太多了。 But showing the new “Gulf of America” name in parentheses to everyone around the world is itself incurring controversy, and, more tellingly, is a strike against the integrity of both the companies and their maps.</p><p>稳定性是固有的。 Google和Apple是骄傲的公司。但是，两者都选择了这个新的美国名字给全世界的无尊严的陈述。 Their mutual decision here ultimately seems driven not by integrity (to be sure), nor the minimization of controversy, but instead by a third, unnatural factor: fear.</p><p> Neither company will comment on it but surely this issue — inconsequential in the grand scheme of things though it may be — rose to the highest ranks of leadership. I&#39;ll eat my hat if Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook didn&#39;t both sign off on, if not actively participate in the decision-making process, how to represent the Gulf of Mexico&#39;s name. Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. But so eager are Pichai and Cook to avoid the wrath and vindictiveness of Trump that they&#39;re willing to peddle his foolish “Gulf of America” name to everyone in the world who doesn&#39;t live in Mexico.将其包裹在括号中就像在报纸上包裹一条死鱼一样 - 它不包含恶臭。</p><p>当然，“美国湾”的名字很愚蠢。特朗普很愚蠢。 Not stupid meaning dim or dull — would that he were, but he remains sharp, cunning, and highly agitated — but stupid because he&#39;s nuts, warped by a narcissistic disorder of Napoleonic dimensions.新名字就像他的杂志帽子一样愚蠢。他可能还将<a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Subsidized_Time">命名权</a>出售给了马斯克和特斯拉。 There is something really wrong with him, and this “Gulf of America” name change exemplifies at least one aspect of his narcissistic insanity.每个人都知道。甚至他的支持者也知道。他们只是告诉自己很好。这就是部落主义变成邪教的方式。</p><p> The false note in Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s parable “The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes” is that once the emperor is called out, for in fact strutting around stark naked while ostensibly wearing a suit of clothes so fine that they&#39;ve visible only to the eyes of smart and discerning people, is that <em>all</em> the townsfolk laugh at him. That wouldn&#39;t happen.许多人会笑。大多数，一个希望。但是，皇帝的顽固支持者会在嘲笑的爆发中愤怒地反应，而不是加入笑声。 He looks great, they&#39;d insist, not like the jackass their own lying eyes tell them he is.</p><p> There is something wrong with Trump — and there is something lesser, but worrisomely wrong with those defending him.</p><p> Apple Maps and Google Maps do not consider themselves cartographic editorial authorities. They choose not to show one universal set of mapping (and naming) data to the world.他们可以。但是他们没有。 Actual editorial authorities, on the other hand, are under no obligation to follow the US GNIS&#39;s official decisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Wikipedia correctly still calls it The Gulf of Mexico</a> . The Associated Press, whose stylebook is followed by many publications, small and large, <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/">issued the following guidance after Trump&#39;s executive order last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.水体在美国和墨西哥之间共享边界。特朗普的命令仅在美国范围内具有权力。 Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years.美联社将以其原始名称来指代特朗普选择的新名称。 As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.</p></blockquote><p> The Trump administration — petty, stupid, vindictive, and most of all, <em>insecure</em> fools that they are — has lashed out, and is now in the midst of a weeklong standoff <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/white-house-continues-its-absurd-ban-against-the-associated-press/">during which they&#39;ve prevented AP journalists from attending official events</a> , entirely and solely because of the AP&#39;s perfectly reasonable style guidance on the Gulf&#39;s name. If Trump and his 2.0 administration had any modicum of confidence that this name change is correct and justified, they&#39;d roll their eyes, not lash out, at the Associated Press for continuing to stipulate otherwise. What kind of government does stuff like that? Everyone knows the answer: tin-pot dictator autocracies. （我们可以希望<em>的是</em>独裁者。） <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-17">5</a></sup>这整个“美国湾”的事情是，如果您退后一步，客观地搞笑。就像匹诺奇奥变成一个真正的男孩一样，特朗普重命名墨西哥湾就像是一个深夜喜剧笑话变成了真实的笑话。 It&#39;s beyond parody.如果这在2024年的竞选期间一直在SNL上，那您会笑。你现在应该笑。嘲笑是一种强大的颠覆性武器，反对权威 - 我认为，<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists">比吉他</a>更有效。</p><p>但是，值得在Google和Apple上引导我们的笑声。 They&#39;re squandering their own hard-earned reputations for integrity to suggest there&#39;s even a parenthetical alternative-name level of international legitimacy — not merely one man&#39;s vanity — behind this.

<p>乔·罗森斯特（Joe Rosensteel）：</p><blockquote><p> Netflix深感遗憾地意外地使Netflix成为其客户更好的产品。 It temporarily pushed out a change that let people <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/have-apple-and-netflix-finally-made-an-apple-tv-deal/">see Netflix shows in the Apple TV app</a> , a change people have been asking for since the debut of the Apple TV app in 2016 with its Up Next queue and content aggregation features. Fortunately, Netflix swiftly corrected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">the error</a> before too many of its users could experience anything approaching joy, or satisfaction with Netflix.客户绝对应该放弃这个问题，而不是按Netflix打开肯定会重新存在的功能。</p></blockquote><p>我明白了为什么Netflix坚持使用该枪支，但它们在错误的一面。 Apple TV users were overjoyed yesterday when the Netflix app briefly started integrating with the TV app for “what next”, etc. Steven Aquino described it as “ <a href="https://www.curbcuts.co/blog/apple-and-netflix-must-do-right-and-finally-make-tv-app-peace-for-accessibilitys-sake">jubilance</a> ”.</p><p> Netflix用户只有一个小子集（也许是Netflix的Grant Global Scare，Dertright Minuscule）使用Apple TV硬件。 But those of us who do, do so because we love it. Most people think “Why pay extra for yet another box to connect, yet another remote control, yet another thing to learn, when Netflix and most other popular streaming services are just built right into my TV?” Apple TV users go the extra mile to buy the extra box — which isn&#39;t cheap — because they have good taste and want an experience that is superior in all regards: technically, UI-wise, and privacy-wise.</p><p> So it&#39;s not just a random small subset of its users that Netflix is disappointing by refusing to adopt the idiomatic conventions of good tvOS citizenship, it&#39;s the subset of users who care the most, for good reasons. It&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like making a Mac-like Mac app rather than serving Mac users warmed-over cross-platform slop. Or, as MG Siegler put it <a href="https://spyglass.org/netflix-apple-tv/#update">when he updated his post</a> after it turned out this was a rug pull, “Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck.

<p>Jay Peters and Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Nearly a month after it was banned in the US, TikTok has returned to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8">App Store for iPhones</a> and other Apple devices as well as the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&amp;e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign">Google Play store</a> for Android phones and tablets.</p><p> The return follows US Attorney General Pam Bondi sending a letter to Apple assuring that it won&#39;t be fined for hosting the app, according to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">which first reported that the app would return</a> .</p></blockquote><p> From Mark Gurman&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">brief report for Bloomberg</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. will restore ByteDance Ltd.&#39;s TikTok to the US App Store on Thursday, following a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m surprised but not shocked by this.但是我肯定想看看那封信到底怎么说。 The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521">PAFACA Act</a> — the law that bans TikTok in the US now that the deadline has passed for ByteDance to sell it to a US company — hasn&#39;t changed or been rescinded, and the current delay in enforcement <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">has no basis in law</a> . Neither Apple nor Google, wisely, have been talking publicly about this at all, but it seems clear that they&#39;ve been acting in concert throughout the process. It is not a coincidence that they both de-listed and now re-listed TikTok simultaneously.</p><p> Also, still no idea how this is going to end, because I really don&#39;t think the CCP is going to allow ByteDance to sell TikTok.

The document does not specify which Tesla model, but the electric Cybertruck, which has a body of high-strength stainless steel, would be the most suitable vehicle.</p><p> Mr. Musk spent more than $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump, who then appointed him as the leader of a cost-cutting initiative that&#39;s been called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p> The purchase of Cybertrucks, an atypical choice for government armored transport, is likely to raise conflict of interest issues, especially as Mr. Musk trumpets his own efforts to root out what he regards as unnecessary spending.</p></blockquote><p> “可能会加薪”在那里做很多工作。这根本不可能是很好的干净采购，每个人都知道。 Either Musk should run his businesses and have nothing to do with the government or he should defer from accepting any and all government contracts for his businesses.即使有人试图从道德上做这件事也无法管理它。这是本质上不道德的。 It&#39;s being reported that this deal started under the Biden administration, which is worth noting, but even if it did, clearly Musk should recuse Tesla from consideration.</p><p>目前，一方无能为力，而另一方面则正处于党派腐败作为政策的全面拥抱中。使特朗普如此难以忽视的一件事是，他的嫁接是公开的。 He ran a luxury hotel with his fucking name on it two blocks from the White House during his first term, and everyone with business before his administration — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/03/05/tmobile-trump-hotel">like when T-Mobile was trying to get approval for its acquisition of Sprint</a> — knew they were expected to stay there.</p><p> trump，正是隐藏的交易和贿赂的“捕捉”表明腐败被根植。但是您无法“抓住”做公开的事情。我们只需要称其为：腐败。</p><p><strong>另请参阅：</strong>吉米·卡特（Jimmy Carter）的2017年专栏文章：“ <a href="https://theonion.com/you-people-made-me-give-up-my-peanut-farm-before-i-got-1819585048/">你们让我在担任总统之前就放弃了我的花生农场</a>”。</p><p><strong>更新：</strong> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/g-s1-48571/trump-administration-order-400-million-worth-of-armored-teslas">Bobby Allyn在NPR报告中</a>：</p><blockquote><p> The State Department said Thursday it is abandoning plans of purchasing $400 million worth of armored Tesla vehicles after a public document detailing federal contracts for fiscal year 2025 gained wide attention.</p><p> That expected purchase of Teslas, which was slated for September of this year, is now on hold, according to the State Department, which now says it has no plans of fulfilling the contract.</p></blockquote><p>好吧，没关系。这里没有腐败。一切都很好。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“ Quid Pro Cyber​​truck”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/quid-pro-cybertruck">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）在他最喜欢的网站上戏弄Apple Product下周发布</title><link href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41572</id><published> 2025-02-13T21：30：00z</published><updated> 2025-02-14T02:14:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

  /></a></p><p> I noticed the change immediately (of course), and my knee-jerk instant reaction was negative. <em>Too big, too bold, too different.不喜欢。</em>那很自然。 Human beings evolved to be alarmed by change. If everything looks the same as usual, everything is probably as safe as usual. If something looks jarringly different, it might be a sign that you&#39;re about to be killed. (Evolutionarily speaking.)</p><p> So I started studying and <em>considering</em> the changes to Fox&#39;s scorebug. I quickly not only warmed up to the new scorebug, I decided I <em>really</em> like it. It&#39;s better than Fox&#39;s old one, and better than every other network&#39;s (which all largely look the same), in almost every single regard.</p><p> I like the new scorebug so much I (cross-)posted about it to social media during the game. My posts, in order of engagement: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">Threads</a> (~6,600 likes, ~700 replies and reposts), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">Bluesky</a> (~3,900 likes, ~600 replies and reposts), and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">Mastodon</a> (179 likes, 53 replies and reposts).</p><p> No change an app developer can make will generate more commentary and emotional feedback from users than changing the app&#39;s icon. Everyone sees an app&#39;s icon, and has an opinion about them. That opinion, after a change, is usually “ <em>I like the old icon and hate the new one.</em> ” Likewise with a game broadcast&#39;s scorebug — everyone sees them, and everyone has an opinion when they change. Most reactions to Fox&#39;s new scorebug were negative, and many of those were <em>really</em> negative. Yahoo Sports ran a story under the headline “ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">Super Bowl: Fox Sports Debuts New Scorebug, to Universally Negative Reaction</a> ”. The sports media-focused site Awful Announcing ran a take by Drew Lerner under the headline “ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">Please Stop Debuting New Scorebugs During the Super Bowl</a> ” (subhead: “Can&#39;t I just watch one Super Bowl without having to learn a new graphic?”). I have not even come close to reading all the replies to my social media take (well, except on Mastodon — it was quick to catch up there), but if you peruse them, you&#39;ll be quick to see that most replies are from people who despise the change. A representative tasting:</p><p> “ <em>It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn&#39;t bother having someone check it first.可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “<em>哈哈。 Muted for being a dumbass.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>It&#39;s hideous, and its overbearing size distracts from the actual content of the game.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don&#39;t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.</em>透明</p><p>“Looks like something out of Fortnite” isn&#39;t the dis the last commenter thinks it is. A lot of people play and love Fortnite.</p><p> Here&#39;s an expanded (from what I posted to social media) version of why I like, perhaps even love, the new scorebug. First, the primary items: who&#39;s playing and what&#39;s the score:</p><ul><li> <em>Team initialisms</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Team logos</em> : None. Colors say enough.</li><li> <em>Score</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Game clock</em> : Big enough and centered.</li><li> <em>Needless chrome</em> : None.</li></ul><p> Every team in the league is known by fans by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation of its home location, sort of like airport codes or stock tickers. They&#39;re all obvious ( <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">unlike many</a> airport codes). The Dallas Cowboys are DAL. The New England Patriots are NE. For the two cities which have two teams, New York and Los Angeles, the cities conveniently abbreviate to two letters and a third letter is drawn from the team nicknames: the Giants and Jets are NYG and NYJ; the Rams and Chargers are LAR and LAC.</p><p> Team logos are not as instantly identifiable, especially at small sizes. A bunch of teams have angry bird mascots: Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Cardinals. Do you remember the Tennessee Titans&#39; logo? Or the Houston Texans&#39;? The Cleveland Browns don&#39;t even have a logo to speak of. (And they&#39;re also not brown.) But I guarantee you know which teams are TEN, HOU, and CLE. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p> And, importantly, these team initialisms are not represented by typography alone: they are in a box with the team&#39;s primary color. That use of color does all the branding work necessary, and does it more effectively, at small sizes or viewed from far distances, than the team logos. (One small niggle I have is that the team initialisms are big white letters but are outlined by the team&#39;s secondary color. If you look closely at my screen capture from yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl above, you&#39;ll see that “KC” is outlined in yellow and “PHI” in silver. This has the effect, at a normal viewing distance, of making the initialisms look a little fuzzy. The secondary color outlines are too subtle to have their intended effect of further branding the teams, and instead have the unintended effect of making the text look poorly rendered on screen. I bet Fox tweaks this by next year.)</p><p> The elimination of all needless chrome is arguably the most striking change of all, because Fox&#39;s old scorebug had the most chrome with the most superfluous “3D” styling and textures. This isn&#39;t minimalism, per se, but it&#39;s a strike against needless decoration — reminiscent to my mind of Jony Ive&#39;s radical redesign of iOS 7 a decade ago. Elements that can be conveyed by type and color alone <em>are</em> expressed by type and color alone.</p><p> Other noteworthy features:</p><ul><li><p> <em>Timeouts remaining</em> : Prominent but not distracting. Seeing how many timeouts a team has remaining was a huge problem with Fox&#39;s old scorebug, and with most other networks&#39; current scorebugs. (Remaining timeouts are very important in close football games.)</p></li><li><p> <em>Current down and yards to go indicator (eg “1st &amp; 10”)</em> : Placement atop the team initialism conveys which team has the ball. Fox&#39;s old scorebug did have a “possession” indicator, but scroll back up to look at it, and see how long it takes you to figure out what it is. I&#39;ll put the answer in a footnote. <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p> <em>Typography</em> : Classic, legible, bold, timeless. It is also very “Fox” — the C in “KC” looks like the O in the classic “FOX” wordmark, and the zero (a digit Chiefs fans became very familiar with until the final seconds of the third quarter, because that&#39;s how many points they&#39;d scored until then — the Eagles cycled through a bunch of different digits en route to taking a 34-0 lead) looks pretty much exactly like the uppercase o in “FOX”.</p></li></ul><p> Bigger and bolder typography adds clarity. But removing the background chrome lets viewers “see through” to any game action that happens at the bottom of the screen. To me, after just one game, the old Fox scorebug looks hopelessly dated; old-fashioned without any nostalgic charm. If anything, the new typography-first design is the one that looks timeless, evocative of the graphics from classic NFL Films productions.</p><hr /><p> Here&#39;s the thing. NFL broadcasts didn&#39;t always have scorebugs. I don&#39;t mean that they had smaller score indicators on screen. I mean they had none at all. This was true for all major sports on TV, not just football (eg the premise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">this gag from <em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a> ). Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials. But while the game played, there was no score on screen. Part of that is technology: game telecasts were low-fidelity over-the-air transmissions to relatively small TV screens that were viewed from across the room. Go back far enough and there wasn&#39;t even color. But a bigger aspect is inertia. Not showing the score at all times was the way games were always broadcast, so it was the way they were still broadcast.</p><p> Then came Fox.</p><p> For decades, there were three major TV networks in the US: ABC, NBC, and CBS. CBS had the Sunday game rights to the superior National Football Conference. “Superior” for the related reasons of team popularity <em>and</em> <a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">team market size</a> , which matters for ratings. Chicago, Philly, Washington, Dallas, Frisco. NBC had the Sunday game rights for the American Football Conference with teams from generally smaller cities. Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Miami. Good teams, but smaller cities. (In 1993, though, NFC teams had won 9 consecutive Super Bowls.)</p><p> Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox network was an attempt — soon enough proven successful — to establish a fourth US network. At the time of their debut in 1987, Fox only had prime time programming on one night a week (Sundays, conveniently). In 1993 Murdoch and Fox upended the world of sports broadcasting by outbidding (stupid, tightfisted, hubristic) CBS for the rights to broadcast the NFC games on Sundays.</p><p> In 2018, Bryan Curtis published at The Ringer a comprehensive oral history of the deal and its consequences: “ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever</a> ”. If this sort of thing interests you at all, read that. It&#39;s a great story, well told.</p><p> But so in 1994 Fox took over the NFC broadcasts. They poached from CBS all the announcers, cameramen, directors, and producers. (CBS didn&#39;t need them anymore, because they had no football games to broadcast.) But while the voices announcing the game were familiar (including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">the best duo ever to do it</a> : John Madden and Pat Summerall), the look and feel of the broadcasts was intentionally new and fresh and, well, because it was Fox, brash. This included an innovation they called the “Fox Box”. Quoting from Curtis&#39;s oral history at The Ringer:</p><blockquote><p> <em>David Hill&#39;s most controversial idea about the NFL was his simplest: He thought the score and clock should have a permanent home on the screen — a feature that became known as the “Fox Box.” A noisy group of critics and rival executives thought the Fox Box was a terrible idea. It would clutter the screen and drive people away from blowouts. But Hill was convinced, because he&#39;d created a proto–Fox Box after a frustrating afternoon watching soccer in the UK</em></p><p> <strong>Hill:</strong> We&#39;d been out walking our dogs. We&#39;d come in, got a cup of tea, and switched the BBC on. I watched the game for a good 15 minutes. I don&#39;t know what the score is. I&#39;m thinking to myself, “Shit, I&#39;d really like to know what the score is.” So I thought, “That&#39;s easy. On a chyron, I&#39;ll just put it up in the corner.” So I did it.</p><p> <strong>Madden:</strong> Instead of saying, “No, that&#39;s a stupid idea, we got other things we have to do,” he said, “If the score and the time is the most important thing, why don&#39;t we just put it up and leave it there?” That&#39;s where the Fox Box came from. That was David Hill.</p><p> <strong>Dolgin:</strong> All the networks told us, “You&#39;re screwing this up. You&#39;re idiots to do this.”</p><p> <strong>Albert:</strong> The thought was, some networks won&#39;t leave the time and score up because it&#39;s a blowout and they didn&#39;t want you to <em>know</em> it&#39;s a blowout.</p></blockquote><p> The “Fox Box” idea wasn&#39;t just controversial, it was widely panned as stupid. The networks literally thought it would be better if many viewers didn&#39;t know the score. And when the Fox Box appeared, many critics agreed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">Dan Cox&#39;s review of Fox&#39;s opening week broadcast for Variety</a> , in September 1994:</p><blockquote><p> The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game. Fox Sports prexy David Hill has said it&#39;s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.</p><p>好吧，是的。 But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p></blockquote><p> Who seems stupid now? Imagine the outcry if Fox had broadcast yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl without any scorebug at all — you know, for those who would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business. Smokers want to smoke and would stay home if they couldn&#39;t, the argument went. Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better. But better necessarily implies different.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-10"><p> You know how when you&#39;re watching most TV channels — not just sports, but any sort of show at all — they keep a logo for the channel in one of the corners of the screen? Those omnipresent logos are called <em>bugs</em> (perhaps because everyone knows they&#39;re slightly annoying?). Hence: scorebug for an always-present score indicator. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-10"><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF Style Guide</a> has no entry for “Roman numerals” because no obscenities or expletives are strong enough to convey the policy. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-10"><p> The one matchup this design might not work great for would be a Rams-Chargers game, because in addition to sharing a city (and stadium), they even share the same team colors: blue and yellow.

<p>Well, the Philadelphia Eagles, of course, won the actual Super Bowl, winning in a romp so one-sided that they would have embarrassed the Chiefs <em>less</em> if they had pantsed Patrick Mahomes at the 50-yard line. But the second contest is for best commercial. And my vote goes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">to Nike</a> .</p><p> The problem with modern Super Bowl commercials is they&#39;re bland. Offensively bland. It really makes no sense to me. The commercial time is famously expensive — Fox was supposedly selling 30-second spots for last night&#39;s game for $8 million — but the sponsors who buy that time tend to squander it with absolute mindless pap.</p><p> Fewer and fewer sponsors each year, it seems, attempt to bring something actually interesting.不同的东西。 Something with some punch. Something that&#39;s <em>actually</em> funny. Something that makes you actually <em>feel</em> . You don&#39;t have to make a genuinely artistic short film, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I">Apple&#39;s Ridley-Scott-directed <em>1984</em> spot</a> heralding the introduction of the Macintosh — the ad that is justifiably regarded as the best commercial ever made. Some of what I&#39;d list among the best Super Bowl ads ever were silly gimmicks that revelled in their abject silliness, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Bowl">the “Bud Bowl” commercials</a> (featuring anthropomorphic bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light playing football) — very far from “high art” but very fun, and created specifically to be shown once and only once, in the context of the Super Bowl. One simple measure is whether the ads are memorable. Most of the ads in last night&#39;s game I forgot by the time the game resumed after the break.</p><p> I don&#39;t know why anyone would book and commission a Super Bowl commercial if they weren&#39;t trying to <em>do</em> something or <em>say</em> something memorable with the spot. Still, though, there are always at least a handful of standouts.</p><p> My favorite yesterday was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">Nike&#39;s “So Win” spot</a> , a heralding of its own — not for a new Nike product, but for the explosion in interest in women&#39;s sports, featuring WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark and a few other top women&#39;s athletes. Gorgeous black and white cinematography. Led Zeppelin&#39;s rollicking “ <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whole-lotta-love/580708374?i=580708471">Whole Lotta Love</a> ” as the soundtrack. And a righteous manifesto of a message, delivered with pitch-perfect gusto by narrator Doechii. Nike, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/nikes-super-bowl-ad-puts-women-athletes-center-stage-on-a-male-dominated-field/">it turns out</a> , hadn&#39;t run a Super Bowl ad since 1998, and they came back with a banger that to me reinvigorated the Nike brand. They&#39;ve been in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/former-nike-ceo-john-donahoe-leadership-lessons-choosing-ceo/">a bit of a free fall</a> and I think this ad was intended as much to inspire Nike employees as it was to female athletes and sports fans. (Shades of Apple&#39;s “Think Different” campaign.) I&#39;ve re-watched this spot a few times while writing this post and I like it more each time.</p><p>荣誉提及：</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/608476/openai-super-bowl-chatgpt-commercial">ChatGPT&#39;s branding spot</a> , positioning AI alongside historical breakthroughs in technology.喜欢它。 I think it was supposed to be a mystery until the very end of the 60-second spot who the ad was for and what exactly it was about, but I guessed “ChatGPT” about 5 seconds in. I kind of hate making a third comparison to an old Apple ad, but ChatGPT&#39;s spot does evoke — not as a rip-off, but homage — the 90-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAEPqUtra6E">“There are a thousand no&#39;s for every yes” opening film from WWDC 2013</a> , perhaps the nadir of Apple&#39;s post-Steve-Jobs grief.</li><li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoeGC-eL4I">Stella Artois</a> : David Beckham learns that he has a twin brother, named Other David Beckham, whom his parents abandoned at birth in America. Beckham sets off to meet him. Don&#39;t read anything more about it, just watch. Good kicker at the end, too.</li></ul><p> Dishonorable mention:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi</a> is a streaming platform owned by Fox. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Apparently</a> it&#39;s existed since 2014 and has been owned by Fox since 2020, but I&#39;d forgotten it existed until this week, when it was in the news as the streaming platform carrying the Super Bowl. Fox ran a couple of house ads, intended to promote Tubi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMDrZDhxWBs">about a young man born with a head shaped like a cowboy hat</a> . Memorable, yes, but the execution was revolting, not funny. The message I took was that Tubi is the streaming app that will make you feel grossed out.</li></ul> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nike&#39;s &#39;So Win&#39; Won the Super Bowl</title></entry><entry><link href="https://go.clerk.com/2n40MWr" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2f" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/02/clerk_--_complete_user_managem" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41559</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-02-10T22:04:37Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T22:04:38Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

For those that have changed, I&#39;ve noted last year&#39;s grade in parentheses.当我编写成绩单时，我没有意识到这一点，但是从去年开始的每个成绩都<em>降低了</em>。没有一个年级上升。 Thinking about that as I write this preamble today, it feels correct: there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent excellence in 2024, but I can&#39;t think of a single area where Apple levelled up.不是一个。 That feels like a problem. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-07">2</a></sup></p><!--less--><p>还值得注意的是，“ Siri”不是成绩单中的独立类别。我们的评分者只是将其评论为其他类别和产品（例如HomePod或Apple Music）中的一个方面。从历史上看，这是有道理的 - 当它<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/10/04Apple-Launches-iPhone-4S-iOS-5-iCloud/">开始</a>时，Siri只是iOS 5的一个浮华的新功能。但是，在这一点上，我认为“ Siri/Apple Intelligence”显然应该被视为本身的类别。思考它的一种方法：任何构成<a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">苹果高级高级主管</a>的整个领域的东西都可能应该是报告卡上的类别。 For Siri and Apple Intelligence, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a> . For another: Apple&#39;s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=apple+intelligence+commercials">heavy marketing of Apple Intelligence</a> suggests they themselves consider it a category-level aspect of the company. I&#39;ve suggested this to Snell, and he&#39;s considering adding it as a proper category next year. (And, unsurprisingly, given his own <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/where-will-apple-intelligence-go-next/">sharp writing on the subject</a> , he was already thinking about it before I pinged him.)</p><p> If “Siri/Apple Intelligence” <em>were</em> a category for this report card, I&#39;d have graded it a D — and much closer to an F than a C. Longstanding Siri features have not only <em>not</em> gotten better, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">they&#39;ve seemingly gotten worse</a> . Apple is simply not a relevant player in the explosively popular LLM game. The features under the “Apple Intelligence” umbrella mostly feel like Apple shipped them a full year ahead of readiness simply because the rest of the industry — and Wall Street — is way ahead of them, and they felt the need to ship what they had, ready or not. There are a lot of obviously useful potential AI-powered features — ones that integrate between apps, and/or use your personal data on-device — that, thanks to the tightly restricted sandboxing system Apple itself designed for iOS, only Apple itself can provide via AI. It doesn&#39;t matter that Apple doesn&#39;t offer, say, its own web search engine, because Safari can use whatever search engine <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/kagi">you want</a> . It <em>does</em> matter that Siri sucks because only Siri can tightly integrate at the system level with your device, and with your private cross-application data. The saving grace — what kept me from giving this if-it-were-a-category category an F — is that a few of Apple&#39;s ML/AI features are actually pretty great. Image search in Photos is excellent, downright amazing at times. The new Clean Up generative AI object/person removal tool in Photos is very good — both technically, and in terms of striking an opinionated balance regarding the nature of photography itself. Private Cloud Compute is a tremendously ambitious initiative — but we haven&#39;t seen much fruit from it yet.</p><h2> Mac: A</h2><p> The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years. Even better, both now seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. Personally I am especially pleased, borderline ecstatic, regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150 extra. (They don&#39;t even charge more for the option on the 16-inch models than 14-inch.)</p><p> The only hitch in the lineup are the Macs Apple <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111835">remain</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111343">unchanged</a> since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC&#39;s first-generation 3nm process, and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC.</p><p> MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release. Reliable and familiar. Apple Intelligence features that I largely don&#39;t use (or at least don&#39;t use much <em>yet</em> ) are easily ignored and do not get in the way of what is tried and true about, by far, the greatest computing platform the world has ever seen.</p><h2> iPhone: A</h2><p> If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.关于iPhone阵容，什么都没有破坏，苹果没有试图修复任何东西。这很好。为了变革而变化是公司下降的最可靠迹象。停滞和傲慢是任何巨大成功的产品的关注点，但是让出色的设计自信地说明自己而不必进行不必要的改变。</p><p> Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I&#39;d like to see the actual button improve (I think it&#39;s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Also: kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models.</p><p> iOS 18是精致，成熟和熟悉的。</p><h2> iPad: C</h2><p> iPad硬件故事很棒。 iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac, and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. （请，苹果：将纳米文本带到iPhone。拿我的钱。）iPad Air在5月对M2芯片进行了很好的更新。 And the iPad Mini got its first update since 2021, and thus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/transcript-phil-schiller-craig-federighi-and-john-ternus-on-the-state-of-apples-pro-macs/">continues to be a product in Apple&#39;s lineup</a> .</p><p>但是，iPados仍然使我成为无人区的平台：在Mac的生产力方面远没有能力； nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months.我发现自己对此有所提高。 Trying to work on an iPad, for me, continues to feel like trying to perform surgery while wearing mittens.</p><h2>总体可穿戴设备：b</h2><p> AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update. AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements this year — most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods continue to exemplify Apple at its best.</p><h2> Apple Watch: C (last year: B)</h2><p> Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn&#39;t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/faces-and-features-apde9218b440/watchos">Flux and Reflections</a> . Setting aside the fact that I personally don&#39;t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11提供了我的快速计数，至少33个不同的手表面提供了非数字秒或指示器。 And only 2 of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate?那是胡扯。 And it wasn&#39;t just a launch thing, because here we are in February, with WatchOS 11.3, and zero additional watch faces have been updated to support it. I will admit to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch">caring far more about always-on seconds hands than most people</a> , but this isn&#39;t how a serious watchmaker deals with technical breakthroughs like this new display with a 1Hz refresh rate. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch.</p><p> Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that&#39;s it. Kind of weird for a watch that starts at $800 — and that seems quite popular — to skip a year of silicon improvements.</p><h2> Vision Pro：B（去年：N/A）</h2><p>这是一个热门吗？不，远离它。 But I remain <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/vision_pro_bites_dog">unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope</a> that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it&#39;s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today&#39;s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the primary impetus for John Sculley and Apple&#39;s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company.这个时代的许多专家都自信地宣称，GUI的整个概念是一个gi头，没有未来。</p><p> Am I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has <em>a</em> bright and essential future ahead of it. The entire concept and paradigm is so new and different that, like the Macintosh 40 years prior, the product had to ship years before a version will be made at a price that appeals to the mass market, and years before there&#39;s all that much to do using it.</p><p>但是，就目前而言，Vision Pro今天为观看传统电影和节目提供了令人难以置信的体验，以及观看空间内容的突破性经验。 If Bang &amp; Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price. Spatial computing feels fun to me, but not very productive. That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro&#39;s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118521">Mac Virtual Display</a> feature is a highly-productive environment for work.</p><p> I can&#39;t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A&#39;s in future years.</p><h2> Home: D (last year: C)</h2><p> I can&#39;t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something.</p><h2> Apple TV: C (last year: B)</h2><p> I&#39;m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024?任何事物？ It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we&#39;re grading what happened in 2024.</p><p> Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. The current one is their best yet, but it has obvious flaws.</p><h2>服务：b</h2><p> TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I&#39;d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: <em>Wolfs</em> should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+&#39;s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: <em>Slow Horses</em> had another crackerjack season, <em>For All Mankind</em> finished a good fourth season, and new shows like <em>Dark Matter</em> , <em>Bad Monkey</em> , and <em>Presumed Innocent</em> were all strong.电视+也是小孩的出色流媒体平台。</p><p> iCloud, especially with iCloud Plus, remains secure, fast, and reliable.它可以在设备之间实现如此多的无缝连续性（因此，这些功能的“<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">连续性</a>”伞品牌）。</p><p> But here we are again, with me repeating the same gripe from previous years: it&#39;s miserly that Apple is still offering a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier, and have left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged since like forever. I crap bigger than 5 GB.我想知道那里有多少千亿iPhone用户没有设备备份，因为他们只有一个带有5 GB的iCloud帐户？ The Apple One bundle is a good deal, but the free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do.</p><h2>硬件可靠性：</h2><p>在这一类别中，没有消息仍然是个好消息。</p><h2> Apple OS质量：B<br/> Apple Apps: B</h2><p> Unchanged comment, and grades, from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple&#39;s software <em>design</em> is headed (or in some ways, has been now for years), but their software <em>reliability</em> has been very good for me.</p><p> One odd trend: several of Apple&#39;s newest apps, like Journal and Sports (and now, though outside the temporal boundary for a 2024 report card, Invites) are only available for iPhone.甚至没有iOS，包括iPhone和iPad。只是iPhone。 Journal in particular belongs on iPadOS and MacOS, too, where people have hardware keyboards for writing.</p><h2> Developer Relations: D (last year: C)</h2><p>连续第四年与基本相同的评论：对App Store政策的不满。 App Store审查过程的挫败感似乎尚未解决。苹果的目标应该是使开发人员关系变得如此好，以至于开发人员寻找借口以专门为苹果平台创建软件。 The opposite is happening.</p><p> The big change globally this year is the Digital Markets Act going into effect in the EU.我与库比蒂诺（Cupertino Punditry）球拍中的许多人分开，鼓掌苹果（Apple）的合规工作。 I think they&#39;ve complied with a terrible law as best they can while protecting their own vision for how their platforms should be designed and work. (And, of course, protecting their own vision for how Apple should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can&#39;t and won&#39;t argue that any of Apple&#39;s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers.</p><p>尽管情况在很大程度上没有变化，但我已经将这个主题从C到D的成绩调整了，因为停滞正在赶上苹果。更多的是使事情变得更糟。 And I think we saw that with the relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro. There&#39;s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- <em>and</em> third-party apps and games.</p><p> With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform. That enthusiasm was tempered greatly last year for VisionOS, and I think it was a lot more about how developers feel about Apple and the App Store than how they feel about Vision Pro itself.</p><h2>社会和社会影响：B（去年：A）</h2><p> Snell&#39;s prompt for this category states, “Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple&#39;s work force, and other political and policy stances.” Apple&#39;s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary.他们的可访问性功能远远领先于行业的其余部分，以至于我什至不知道谁位居第二。 On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple&#39;s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now sharply right.</p><p> If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade.但是：政治。 I understand (I think) Tim Cook&#39;s thinking and approach. I wouldn&#39;t want his job, and genuinely wonder at times who would. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">Sing-song congratulatory tweets</a> leave a bitter taste, but I&#39;m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they&#39;ve been dealt, not the cards they&#39;d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don&#39;t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can&#39;t donate $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/the-great-american-tradition">a mere $43,200 to Biden&#39;s</a> and expect us to do anything but laugh at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">the supposed justification</a> that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That&#39;s Tim Cook&#39;s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it&#39;s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it.</p><p> I genuinely believe Cook is doing what&#39;s best for Apple, and that&#39;s quite literally his job. But it was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/cook_trump_campaign_ad">true during the first Trump administration</a> , and already is again in the second, that what&#39;s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what&#39;s best for the country and for the world.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-07"><p> In my previous report cards I&#39;ve described my scale as A to E (A = 5 ... E = 1), but here in the US, schools <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/9283/grading-system-why-a-f-and-not-e">traditionally</a> (but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uofu/comments/bofpny/what_is_the_difference_between_an_e_grade_and_an/">not always</a> ) omit E as a letter grade and use F as the grade below D, as the obvious shorthand for <em>fail</em> — and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">apparently</a> , to disambiguate from some weirdo schools that use a system in which E stands for <em>excellent</em> . （我给该分级系统一个F。）我从来没有不必对E和F进行过很多思考，因为我从来没有想到要在任何类别中给出失败的成绩是适当的。但是，考虑了今年的假设“ Siri/Apple Intelligence”类别，使我对失败的成绩进行了漫长的思考。 And I realized that should be an F, not an E. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-07"><p>如果您对我说：“<em>来吧，您无法想到一个</em>单一的<em>区域，苹果在2024年比2023年做得更好吗？ Not one? There has to be something...</em> ” I would offer as a response, without hesitation, Apple TV original content. As I wrote just over a month ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/31/">in my final post of the year</a> , I would argue with anyone that the average quality of an Apple TV+ original show is higher than that for any other streaming platform. It really is the new HBO — not the most content, but the best content. That&#39;s very <em>Apple</em> .</p><p> But that&#39;s not a separate category on the Six Colors Report Card. Apple TV+ falls under “Services” (under which category I call it out for praise in this very report card), and my very high esteem for Apple TV+&#39;s original content doesn&#39;t justify bumping up my grade for “Services” as a whole — a sprawling category that, financially, a decade ago become Apple&#39;s second-biggest and is <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">seemingly on a trajectory</a> to <a href="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apple-earnings-1.png?ssl=1">eventually surpass even the iPhone</a> — from a B to an A.</p><p> I don&#39;t see Apple&#39;s foray into entertainment production as a distraction. Apple的人们从事计算机硬件，软件和服务的工作，无论是工程师，设计师，经理，甚至是高级管理人员，都不以任何方式参与TV+。这并不是说苹果是现金浪费的，并将有限的资源转移到娱乐生产预算上，而牺牲了产品开发或研发。 Apple, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, can act a bit like a conglomerate without losing focus on its core business of making the world&#39;s best computers, on which customers enjoy the world&#39;s best computing experiences. TV+ is an important leg on the stool of reasons for people to subscribe to an Apple One services bundle.但是，至少，我认为苹果去年最有所进步的地区至少有点令人担忧，这与该核心业务完全无关。</p><p>卓越，无论持续多长时间，总是不稳定 - 微妙而脆弱 - 在屈服于傲慢和父亲时代的边缘。 <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★我的2024 Apple成绩单</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
