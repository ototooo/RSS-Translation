<p>Peter Coy，在《纽约时报》的订阅者专栏中（我使用了礼物分享链接，希望对你们所有人都有效）：</p><blockquote><p>苹果公司在假期期间销售了大量智能手表，但今年圣诞节后的第二天，其大多数 Apple Watch 型号的销量很可能会下降 100%，甚至为零。</p><p>这是因为国际贸易委员会周四<a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files?file=secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1276_notice10262023sgl.pdf">裁定</a>，大多数 Apple Watch 所含部件侵犯了医疗技术生产商 Masimo Corp. 及其姐妹公司 Cercacor Laboratories Inc.（均位于加利福尼亚州欧文市）持有的专利。进口禁令和停止销售令均将于 12 月 26 日生效——除非拜登总统在 12 月 25 日之前推翻这一决定，而这似乎不太可能。 （总统<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">很少</a>否决这个<a href="https://www.usitc.gov/">独立的无党派机构</a>，该机构<a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub0000.pdf">成立</a>于 1916 年，当时名为美国关税委员会。） [...]</p><p>苹果拒绝提供一位高管公开发言。该公司的立场是，Masimo 正在推行一种诉讼而非创新的策略，希望能产生新的特许权使用费，因为过去诉讼的特许权使用费已经枯竭。苹果公司指出，5 月份陷入僵局的联邦陪审团以 6 比 1 的比例支持苹果公司，这表明 Masimo 距离提出自己的主张还有很长的路要走。</p><p>这场战斗还远没有结束。 “我的目​​标不仅仅是击败苹果，”基亚尼在去年夏天的一次采访中告诉我。 “这是为了让苹果改变它的方式。”</p></blockquote><p>无论如何，我预计 Apple Watch 仍将在美国销售，但距离最后期限只有两个月了。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“可能使苹果手表退出市场的专利斗争”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/apple-watch-masimo-patent-suit">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “Scary Fast”的幕后花絮 — 使用 iPhone 15 Pro Max 拍摄</title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v42" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40322</id><published> 2023-10-31T17:12:56Z</published><updated> 2023-10-31T19:54:57Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Stephen Robles 测试了 iPhone 15 Pro 的 11 款皮套，并<a href="https://youtu.be/6WNnw9Swhyc?si=ydQemaV8V6iubGZN">制作了一段精彩的视频评测</a>。如果您正在市场上为您的新 iPhone 15 购买皮革 iPhone 保护壳，您绝对应该观看他的视频。</p><p>在过去的三四年里，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll">我一直</a>从<a href="https://bullstrap.co/products/magsafe-iphone-cases-sienna?variant=43515355300034">Bullstrap</a>购买 iPhone 皮革保护壳。它们很贵——89 美元——但他们帮我勾选了每一个框：</p><ul><li>高品质皮革。感觉很好，闻起来很好，很适合老化。</li><li>镂空的下唇。这种设计曾经很常见，但在 iPhone 手机<em>壳</em>上越来越难找到。我认为这是因为人们更喜欢带有围绕手机正面整个圆周的边缘的保护壳，“以提供保护”，但覆盖底部边缘的额外保护对我来说似乎可以忽略不计。我非常喜欢从手机底部向上滑动时无底唇保护壳的感觉——我每天会执行数十次这个动作。此设计还解决了 iPhone 封装时有关 USB-C 或 Thunderbolt 电缆安装的<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+case+usb-c+cable+doesn't+fit">任何问题</a>。</li><li>好按钮。按钮不是很好，但是很好。这包括用于操作按钮的按钮，而不是切口。</li><li>相机切口周围独特的（嗯，有点像——见下文）“柔和的驼峰”设计。我觉得这看起来不错，而且<em>感觉</em>很棒。我不喜欢相机切口周围有锋利的塑料环。</li></ul><p>罗伯斯对 Bullstrap 的评价很高，但落后<a href="https://ryanlondon.com/collections/leather-iphone-cases/products/leather-iphone-15-pro-max-shell-case-magsafe-saddle-brown?variant=46641687822656">于 Ryan London 的案例</a>。我不知道这两家公司之间的交易是什么，但他们的案例几乎相同。相同的形状（没有下唇），相同的按钮，相机切口周围相同的轻微驼峰。我怀疑这两家公司在中国使用的是同一家制造商。 Robles 更喜欢 Ryan London，因为他更喜欢其皮革的外观和触感。它看起来确实质感略有不同。此外，Ryan London 手机壳要便宜一些：59 美元（可选的 8 美元附加服务，可以用一些浮雕文字个性化您的手机壳）。</p><p><strong>之前：</strong><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll">我从 4 月份开始就 DF 读者的案例使用情况进行了读者调查</a>。我发布了<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/bullstrap-case-before-after.jpeg">这张照片，将一年前的 Bullstrap 保护壳与我去年 iPhone 14 的全新保护壳进行了比较</a>。</p><p><strong>后记</strong>：我其实很喜欢苹果的 FineWoven 手机壳。我带着 iPhone 15 Pro 在佛罗里达州度假了一个星期。 （我大部分时间都不戴保护壳，但就像在旅行时使用保护壳一样，此时我更有可能用手机拍摄大量照片。对我来说，带保护壳的 iPhone 感觉更像是相机，抓地力更好。）对我来说最重要的不是 FineWoven 材料，我实际上有点喜欢这种材料。相反，它是下唇。如果苹果的 FineWoven 保护壳底部有一个切口，那可能是我唯一会使用的保护壳。</p><p><strong>天哪，另一个后记：</strong>我，呃，今天早上碰巧遇到了来自 The Verge 的<a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dan-seifert">Dan Seifert</a> ，你难道不知道吗，他的 iPhone 15 Pro 上有一个全新的 Ryan London 皮套。我带着 Bullstrap，我们进行了比较，我们都同意 Ryan London 皮革看起来同样好，但感觉略有不同，但感觉更好。它们中的任何一个都不会出错——它们总体上确实非常相似，几乎可以肯定是由同一家中国制造商制造的——但考虑到它便宜 30 美元，我想我会推荐 Ryan London。不过，我实际上很喜欢 Bullstrap 浮雕标志。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 最适合 iPhone 15 Pro 的皮套</title></entry><entry><title>“马修·佩里是《老友记》中讽刺的灵魂” </title><link href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/matthew-perry-death-friends-chandler-bing-sarcasm-sitcom-1234865183/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v40" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40320</id><published> 2023-10-29T19:28:47Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T20:44:23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>艾伦·塞平沃尔（Alan Sepinwall）为《滚石》杂志撰稿：</p><blockquote><p> <em>《老友记》</em>试播集中马修·佩里的出场次数并不多，但他却讲了其中最有趣的笑话之一。当这伙人围坐在 Central Perk 附近时，刚离婚的罗斯承认他只是想再次结婚。一秒钟后，雷切尔浑身湿透，穿着婚纱走进咖啡店。佩里饰演的钱德勒·宾毫不犹豫地宣称：“我只想要一百万美元！”</p><p>就像钱德勒的许多妙语一样，它的讽刺很快又尖锐。就像钱德勒的许多妙语一样，佩里的表达将它从几十个演员可以说出的自作聪明的俏皮话提升为你无法想象从其他人嘴里说出的话。</p><p>注意事情的时间和重点。 “And I”之后的停顿，他用力敲击“I”的方式，以及他在说“Million Dollars”时声音充满游戏节目主持人的方式，所有这些结合起来，给这个笑话带来了超出预期的音乐性。 <em>《老友记》的</em>创作者玛塔·考夫曼和大卫·克兰在页面上写道。这是一集中的一个小时刻，主要涉及钱德勒·宾以外的角色。但当你观看它时，你想听他一次又一次地说类似的话。</p></blockquote><p>佩里在<em>《老友记》</em>中表现出色，但我最喜欢他参加的节目是<em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/studio-60-on-the-sunset-strip/umc.cmc.2shyb7anow8v1rlv12c6lsx7v">日落大道上短命的 Studio 60</a></em> ，这是 2006 年亚伦·索金 (Aaron Sorkin) 的节目，我一直认为它部分失败<sup>*</sup>因为它比它早了几年时间。该剧仅有 22 集，在 NBC 播出。对于网络电视来说，它太智能、太电影化了。它应该在像 HBO 这样的有线频道上播出，或者如果十年后播出的话，应该在流媒体服务上播出。这部剧非常精彩（有时，22 集对于追求如此品质的剧集来说太多了），而且佩里也很出色。</p><p>佩里也值得赞扬，因为他对自己长期与毒瘾作斗争的坦诚态度，以及他真诚地愿意帮助任何人和其他人解决这个问题。安息。</p><p> <small>* 我不知道这是否伤害了<em>日落大道上的 Studio 60</em> ，但另一个奇怪的事情是它与蒂娜·菲 (Tina Fey) 的名人堂搞笑情景喜剧<em><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/30-rock/6240863759978157112">《30 Rock》</a></em>同年在同一网络上首次亮相。这两部剧有着相同的基本前提：它们都是关于<em>《周六夜现场》</em>的虚构版本。他们的头衔中甚至都有数字，而且这些数字出奇地相似。 <em>《Studio 60》</em>是一部搞笑剧， <em>《30 Rock》</em>是情景喜剧中的情景喜剧，但我一直想知道同时推出两部关于<em>《周六夜现场》</em>的<em>罗马谱号</em>是不是一个坏主意。</small></p><div> <a  title="永久链接“马修·佩里是《老友记》的讽刺灵魂”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “马修·佩里让事情看起来很简单” </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-chandler-bing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3z" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40319</id><published> 2023-10-29T19:17:26Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T19:17:27Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>亚历克西斯·索洛斯基（Alexis Soloski）为《纽约时报》撰文：</p><blockquote><p>坦白说：当我收到演员马修·佩里（Matthew Perry）去世的消息时，我的脑海里浮现出佩里完善的钱德勒·宾（Chandler Bing）角色的特殊节奏，他在 NBC 情景喜剧《<em>老友记》</em>中扮演了 10 季的角色。我的想法是这样的：“这<em>还能</em>更悲伤吗？”</p><p> 54 岁的佩里在<em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething">《朋友、恋人和可怕的大事》</a></em>出版近一年后<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html">去世</a>，这是一本异常坦率的关于毒瘾和康复的回忆录。正如他在那本书中详细描述的那样，他职业生涯中最美好的岁月是在健忘、回避、麻木中度过的——这些条件通常不会鼓励出色的表演。但他很棒。希望清醒能让他好起来，让他恢复到巅峰时期那种紧张、本能的光彩，这似乎是合理的，虽然有些玫瑰色。现在这个希望已经破灭了。 [...]</p><p>说他从未做过像<em>《老友记</em>》之前或之后那样好的事情，并不是贬低他的成就。即使在他的搭档们难以抑制的才华中，佩里也脱颖而出，他以一种橡胶般、漫不经心的肢体喜剧方式和大多数秒表都会羡慕的瞬间计时。如果你看过该剧的几集以上——而且有数以百万计的人看过，包括在首播几年后出生的粉丝——你就会吸收钱德勒的节奏、他的流行语，以及佩里英俊、​​月亮般的脸像氨纶一样伸展的方式。 ，卖出反应越好。他既对一条线的要求有绝对的承诺，又以一种温和地讽刺这条线的方式。他的性格是笑柄。佩里也参与了同样的笑话。他身上有一种孩子气，这似乎可以为他的角色在<em>《老友记》</em>和随后的角色中最糟糕的行为找借口。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接“Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>脱口秀节目：“情歌太多了吗？” </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/27/ep-387" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/the-talk-show-387" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40317</id><published> 2023-10-28T00:51:01Z</published><updated> 2023-10-28T00:51:01Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell 在《六色》上撰文介绍了 iOS 17.2 中新的“在消息中使用表情符号作为贴纸反应”功能，该功能今天刚刚作为公开测试版发布：</p><blockquote><p>相反，要发送贴纸回复，您必须点击并按住一条消息，然后从出现的上下文菜单中选择“添加贴纸”，然后选择贴纸或表情符号。这是一个实际上没有必要的额外步骤，并且使贴纸感觉像是事后才想到的，而事实显然确实如此。</p><p>情况变得更糟。当您添加贴纸反应时，它会放置在您要做出反应的消息的顶部，遮盖部分文本！为什么苹果会选择一个让人无法阅读正在回复的文本的位置呢？这些反应的正确位置是……等等……与 Tapbacks 出现的位置相同，在一个小气泡中，依偎在正在反应的消息上。</p></blockquote><p>这个设计让我感觉有点恶意。我怀疑苹果公司内部有两支队伍：“ <em>Tapbacks 本身就是完美的”一方（他们</em>更喜欢只有六种——心形、竖起大拇指、竖起大拇指、哈哈、“!!”，以及“？”——谁坚持认为它们是单色的），而“<em>天啊，世界上所有其他流行的消息平台都允许用户用他们想要的全彩表情符号做出反应</em>”。这个新的表情符号贴纸功能对于后者来说是一个小小的胜利，但 Tapbacks 是完美的一方正在发号施令，并将 Tapbacks 作为唯一的反应，(a) 非常容易应用，并且 ( b) 不要模糊消息的文本。</p><p>我一直在使用该功能，我发现的一个表情符号<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/emoji-stickers-finger.jpeg">仅<em>勉强</em>遮盖了它所应用的消息文本，</a>而这恰好是表达我对该功能当前如何工作的感受的完美表情符号：🖕。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“iOS 17.2（Beta）贴纸反应臭”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/ios-17-sticker-reactions-stink">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Google 每年花费 260 亿美元成为几乎所有地方的默认搜索引擎（其中大部分都归谁所有） </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934961/google-antitrust-trial-defaults-search-deal-26-3-billion" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40314</id><published> 2023-10-27T19:31:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T19:53:50Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>大卫·皮尔斯（David Pierce）为 The Verge 撰文：</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates"><em>美国诉谷歌</em>反垄断审判</a>涉及很多事情，但最重要的是，它涉及违约的力量。即使切换浏览器、平台或搜索引擎很容易，打开它时出现的那个也很重要。谷歌显然同意这一点，并支付了巨额费用来确保其成为默认搜索引擎：审判中的证词显示，谷歌在 2021 年总共花费了 263 亿美元，以成为多个浏览器、手机和平台的默认搜索引擎。 [...]</p><p>简单来说一下这 263 亿美元的背景：谷歌母公司 Alphabet 在 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23929496/google-alphabet-q3-2023-earnings-ads-ai-sge">其最近的收益报告</a>中宣布，谷歌搜索广告业务在过去三个月中带来了约 440 亿美元的收入，去年约为 1650 亿美元。其整个广告业务（还包括 YouTube 广告）的利润略低于 900 亿美元。这都是纸巾后面的数学，但本质上，谷歌正在将其搜索收入的约 16% 和利润的约 29% 放弃给这些分销交易。</p><p>当然，大部分资金都流向了苹果。 《纽约时报》最近报道称，谷歌成为谷歌产品 Safari 中默认搜索引擎的交易使该公司在 2021 年损失了 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion">约 180 亿美元</a>。</p></blockquote><p>高盛分析师多年来一直在估计这个数字，2021 年的 180 亿美元与他们的估计基本一致。 （高盛<em>保守</em>估计，到 2023 年，谷歌向苹果支付的<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traffic-acquisition-cost-tac.asp">TAC</a>费用约为 170 亿美元。这将是最低值——苹果<em>至少</em>从谷歌那里获得了这么多的合作伙伴关系。）</p><p> Apple 将这一收入计入服务项目，该<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/">收入每季度增长超过 200 亿美元</a>。因此，Apple 服务收入的 20-25% 仅来自 Google 的这些付款。你可以明白为什么<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google">苹果在这场诉讼中支持谷歌</a>。</p><p>与谷歌的整个合作关系是苹果整体隐私立场中最薄弱的环节。谷歌通过用户跟踪从搜索中赚取了如此多的钱，苹果会认为这违背了自己的内部价值观。如果苹果运行自己的搜索引擎，它将比谷歌搜索<em>更加</em>私密。但相反，他们与 Google 合作，将 Google 设置为所有平台上 Safari 的默认设置，并分享 Google 每年约 200 亿美元的利润。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Google 每年花费 260 亿美元成为几乎所有地方的默认搜索引擎（其中大部分都归谁所有）”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>更像 RipoffOS，我说得对吗？ </title><link href="https://www.gizchina.com/2023/10/19/hyperos-xiaomi-poco-redmi/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/xiaomi-hyperos" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40313</id><published> 2023-10-27T18:44:03Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T18:44:04Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>轴：</p><blockquote><p>新众议院议长迈克·约翰逊（路易斯安那州共和党人）在他作为议长的第一次采访中告诉福克斯新闻的肖恩·汉尼蒂，现在不是讨论立法解决大规模枪击祸害的时候，他补充道：“问题在于人心，不是枪。”</p></blockquote><p>由于地球上没有其他文明国家发生过这样的屠杀，约翰逊含蓄地认为问题不在于<em>人心</em>，而在于<em>美国人的</em>心。</p><p>或者，也许问题在于，美国是<em>唯一一个</em>军用级突击步枪不仅合法，而且像缅因州的这个疯子这样患有精神疾病的愤怒男子也可以合法获得的国家。</p><p>要么我们是地球上最糟糕的人，要么我们拥有最糟糕的枪支法。</p><blockquote><p>重要性：在缅因州刘易斯顿发生导致 18 人死亡的枪击事件后，拜登总统和国会民主党人敦促采取行动。约翰逊认为，“在危机期间”讨论枪支管制是不合适的，他认为，“问题不是武器，而是根本问题。”</p></blockquote><p>每次枪支屠杀之后，共和党人都会提出“<em>现在不是时候</em>”的论点。就在他们发布“思考和祈祷”的推文之后。废话。大屠杀之后是要求采取理智的枪支管制措施的<em>时候</em>了。这时候问题就清楚了。共和党人会认为 10 月 8 日不是以色列讨论哈马斯恐怖主义的“合适时机”吗？ 2001 年 9 月 12 日是否“不是讨论基地组织的最佳时机”？罗斯福是否应该在 1941 年 12 月 8 日向全国发表讲话，建议我们放松，让冷静的头脑占上风，因为日本袭击珍珠港的后果“不是考虑报复的时候”？</p><p>想象一下，一名委内瑞拉难民下周非法越过美墨边境，并用他携带的炸弹杀死了 18 名美国公民。汉尼蒂是否会邀请福克斯新闻的嘉宾——比如迈克·约翰逊——辩称“在危机之中，现在不是谈论边境安全的时候”？</p><p>我们对这些屠杀的情绪反应是合理的。趁着铁和我们的血液还热的时候出击。让我们的情绪加剧我们试图以<a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/instant-intel/house-gun-legislation-background-checks-polling">压倒性的受欢迎的枪支管制立法</a>做出回应的紧迫性，并让共和党人在两周后进入选举反对他们。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“大屠杀的后果永远是推动枪支立法的时候”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/aftermath">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CT 扫描揭示了 Apple 售价 129 美元的 Thunderbolt 电缆的复杂性</title><link href="https://twitter.com/jonbruner/status/1714696044356005949" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/apple-thunderbolt-cable" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40309</id><published> 2023-10-26T00:00:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T00:57:06Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Also, there&#39;s a risk of legal trouble, getting your internet service disabled, or just plain embarrassment if some piracy watchdog catches you (bad).</p></li><li><p> <strong>Pay:</strong> Cough up the monthly subscription fee for the service (bad), feel no guilt because you&#39;re not stealing anything (good), avoid the hassles of obtaining and managing bootlegged media content (good), and enjoy the ease of use of the official app for the service.</p></li></ul><p> I didn&#39;t put a “(good)” or “(bad)” after that last one, because it varies so wildly from one service to another. The only content I&#39;ve bootlegged in years are those rare films that aren&#39;t available through legitimate channels, like the wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition">“de-specialized” editions of the original Star Wars trilogy</a> . In addition to the fact that I have more money than sense, I&#39;m incredibly lazy when it comes to consuming entertainment. I don&#39;t want to work, at all, to find it, download it, or manage it. But some streaming apps are so bad they make it feel like as much work to watch their content legitimately as it would be to pirate it.</p><p> That&#39;s one thing that is vastly under-remarked-upon regarding Netflix: they&#39;ve always provided a terrific user experience. Their apps are fast, reliable, and well-designed. Netflix never forgets or expires my sign-in credentials. You can tell that everyone at Netflix, right up to Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings, <em>cares</em> about the entire user experience. Netflix, culturally, is much like Apple in that regard: they have good taste baked into the company DNA.</p><p> As for Apple&#39;s price hikes today, I&#39;m an Apple One Premier subscriber, and I&#39;m fine — not happy, of course, but fine — with paying an extra $5/month for everything I get. Of the three component services whose standalone prices went up, TV+ and Arcade seem justified. News+, however, does not.</p><p> I&#39;ve been saying for a few years that Apple TV+ is becoming the new HBO — a channel dedicated to prestigious original content, quality over quantity — and that feels more true than ever now that HBO is being <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/warner_max">watered down inside Max</a> . Apple TV+ is home to a steady stream of original shows that my family really enjoys. I&#39;m pretty sure we have more favorite shows on TV+ than any other service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">Unlike Netflix</a> , Apple sticks with all its good shows and renews them for multiple seasons, allowing them to end satisfyingly. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-25">1</a></sup> TV+&#39;s average content quality is way higher than that of Disney+, which has been cranking out <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CyHm6Ots64Q">embarrassing franchise-tanking turds</a> like <em>Ahsoka</em> and <em>Secret Invasion</em> , relative disappointments like <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> (a bloviating six-part series which should have been cut down to one solid two-hour movie), and only occasional gems like <em>Andor</em> . And while Apple TV+ has long stood out for its relative dearth of old library content, in terms of original new content, it has way more good stuff — for my taste at least — than Amazon Prime, Hulu, Max, or the also-rans like Peacock and Paramount+. I just don&#39;t care as much about streaming access to old library content compared to new original stuff, and I don&#39;t think most other people do either.</p><p> As for Apple Arcade — I personally don&#39;t play many video games, but more and more, the ones I <em>do</em> play on my iPhone are from Arcade. No ads, no in-app-purchase pay-to-win chicanery, and an ever-growing library of really good games that span a wide range of genres. $7/month feels more than fair.</p><p> But News+? The primary and obvious appeal of Apple News+ is getting access to paywalled content from <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/publications/">participating publications</a> like The Wall Street Journal. That&#39;s a long list of newspapers and magazines. But the actual reading experience often stinks — most articles from most publishers in Apple News are lousy with huge ugly ads, breaking up each article every few paragraphs. And the ads are often almost comically low-class <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/">chumbox</a> scams. I posted <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">screenshots of a few of them</a> just a few weeks ago on Mastodon. Just look at them. <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-25">2</a></sup> These ads — and the quantity of them — do not look or feel like something you should experience in a premium $10/month subscription — let alone the new price of $13/month. The only way this price increase for News+ can be justified is if Apple is planning to use the increased subscription fee revenue to both reduce the number of ads in articles <em>and</em> increase their quality.</p><p> As with bootlegging media and pirating games and apps, ad blocking is a negotiation between users and publishers. Reading the same article in a web browser, with extensions installed that block user-hostile ads, is, for me at least, almost always a far better experience than reading in Apple News. Given that News+ is a not-cheap paid subscription, that user-experience equation should be the other way around: it should be nicer to read in Apple News than on the web. But it&#39;s not. And yet Apple is raising the price.</p><p> Finally, I&#39;ll note with mild annoyance but absolutely zero surprise that while Apple is now steadily <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/apple-price-increase-apple-tv-plus-music-1235412633/#">raising prices for its media content services every year or so</a> , the data storage tiers for iCloud — whether free or paid — have remained <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9341083/apple-icloud-storage-plans-cheaper">unchanged since 2015</a> except at the highest tier. Eight years! Steady increases in media subscription pricing are annoying but understandable. Never increasing the amount of storage most users get with iCloud feels stubborn and spiteful.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-25"><p> I said <em>good</em> shows, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/business/media/jon-stewart-the-problem-ends.html">not all shows</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-25"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-10-25"><p> If you scroll through the replies to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">my post on Mastodon</a> , you&#39;ll see a few people suggesting that the reason I&#39;m getting served bottom-of-the-barrel chumbox ads like this is that I must have “Personalized Ads” turned off in Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Apple Advertising.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> The new double tap gesture for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available today with watchOS 10.1, bringing a fast and convenient new way to interact with Apple Watch.</p><p> With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly perform many of the most common actions. This new feature complements existing gestures like tap, swipe, raise to wake, and cover to mute that make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been testing a Series 9 watch with beta software enabling double tap for the last month or so. It&#39;s a good feature, but it&#39;s not nearly as useful — yet? — as I was hoping. The one thing you have to get used to is that the watch only listens for the double tap gesture when the display is fully-on. You need to tilt your wrist to look at your watch before double tapping. Usually, that&#39;s natural — the reason you want to double tap to <em>do something</em> is because you see the thing you want do or dismiss. But I&#39;ve found times where an alert or something pops up that I want to invoke double tap on, but my wrist is oblique, and double tap doesn&#39;t register until I remember to tilt my wrist to a “looking straight at it” angle.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Double Tap Gesture Now Available With WatchOS 10.1 for Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/double-tap-watchos-10">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://tailscale.com/?utm_source=DaringFireball&amp;utm_medium=paid-referral&amp;utm_campaign=2023-2H" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3y" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/10/tailscale_2" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40318</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-10-24T19:13:25Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T19:13:41Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/spooktacular-apple-event-on-halloween-eve/">Dan Moren, Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Chalk this one up as something I&#39;ve never seen before: an Apple event in the <em>evening</em> . The company on Tuesday announced a “Scary Fast” event coming Monday, October 30 at 5pm Pacific time.</p><p> It&#39;s largely expected that this event will feature new Macs, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">reported by Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman this weekend</a> : the money seems to be on a refreshed 24-inch iMac, though other announcements are possible.</p></blockquote><p> Broadcasting an event at 8pm ET / 5pm PT is new, but we&#39;re still relatively early in the era of pre-recorded keynotes. Unusual to say the least — makes me wonder if there&#39;s some other shoe to drop that will make the timing make sense.</p><p> If it&#39;s the iMac, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the upgrade is to the M2, not the M3. Gurman reported that the iMac would skip the M2 and go straight to the M3, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-26/apple-aapl-plans-iphone-14-apple-watch-series-8-m2-macs-for-2022-and-2023-l4vd5unx">that report was all the way back in June <em>2022</em></a> :</p><blockquote><p> Outside of the Mac and iPad Pro, there&#39;s another place I expect the M2 to appear: Apple&#39;s mixed-reality headset. I&#39;m told the latest internal incarnations of the device run the base M2 chip along with 16 gigabytes of RAM. [...]</p><p> Apple is also already at work on the M2&#39;s successor, the M3, and the company is planning to use that chip as early as next year with updates to the 13-inch MacBook Air code-named J513, a 15-inch MacBook Air known as J515, a new iMac code-named J433 and possibly a 12-inch laptop that&#39;s still in early development.</p></blockquote><p> He was correct about the Vision Pro using the M2 — and remember, that was a full year ahead of it being announced — but it doesn&#39;t feel right to me that the M3 chip would debut in the iMac. Gurman has also pointed out that MacBook Pros — both the not-really-all-that-“pro” 13-inch model, and the truly-pro 14- and 16-inch models — are in short supply at the moment, with mid-November shipping dates for most configurations. But it just feels too early for the M3 Pro/Max chips to start shipping, when the A17 Pro — the chip the M3 is presumably based on — only started shipping last month. Given what I&#39;ve heard about TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability — particularly obtaining wafers — I think their hands are full just producing A17 Pro chips for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p><p> So I&#39;m just guessing here, but I&#39;m thinking this event might be about iMacs only, with an upgrade to the M2, and maybe some design changes — like, say, fresh colors. It&#39;d be a lot more fun if it&#39;s the debut of the M3, but my spidey sense says that&#39;s not happening yet.</p><p> <em>Also</em> : It would sort of feel awkward to start launching $1,300 M3-based iMacs (or $1,000 iPad Pros) months ahead of the $3,500 Vision Pro, which will have the M2. It feels natural to me that M3-based Macs and iPads will only launch <em>after</em> the Vision Pro, so that when the Vision Pro is announced, the M2 is still the “current” Apple silicon generation.</p><p> <em>But</em> : The event is named “Scary Fast”, so maybe it <em>is</em> about the debut of the M3 series? I still don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have the M3 Pro/Max chips ready, but maybe it&#39;s a refresh across the line for all the Macs that use the regular M2 (and in the iMac&#39;s case, M1)?</p><p> So it looks like Gurman is going to beat Ming-Chi Kuo in the “are new Macs coming this year?” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Thunderdome face-off</a> , but it&#39;s fun that no one seems to know what exactly is coming.</p><h2> Postscript</h2><p> OK here&#39;s a spitball idea that fits all the puzzle pieces together:</p><ul><li> Regular 24-inch iMacs get upgraded to the M2.</li><li> These new iMacs might also be the source for those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">purported color-matched braided USB-C cables</a> that were assumed to be for the iPhones 15. All iPhone 15 models ship with plain white braided cables, but the existing M1 iMacs shipped with fun color-matched Lightning cables.</li><li> New “pro” iMacs are launched, with the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, like the ones in the current 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros (which only debuted early this year). Maybe these hypothetical iMac Pros will have bigger displays too? 27 inches would match both the Studio Display and the old Intel-based “big” iMacs.</li></ul><p> M2 Pro and Max iMacs would justify “Scary Fast” in a way that just plain M2 iMac speed bumps would not. This would still allow the Vision Pro to launch “early next year” while the M2 remains the current Apple silicon generation. And this would fit with the scuttlebutt that TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability is, for the near future, almost entirely dedicated to keeping up with demand for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple to Broadcast &#39;Scary Fast&#39; Event Next Monday Night</title></entry><entry><title> The End of iTunes? </title><link href="https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/apple-is-finally-killing-off-itunes-for-real-this-time/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40305</id><published> 2023-10-24T17:33:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-25T23:42:42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Kirk McElhearn, writing at The Mac Security Blog:</p><blockquote><p> While some can cast aside the accumulated goodwill of a brand name on a whim, Apple doesn&#39;t like to do so. Even after splitting the iTunes app, Apple retained the iTunes Store name for selling digital content. You access the iTunes Store in the Music app on the Mac to buy music, and the iPhone and iPad still have iTunes Store apps. But there is some overlap: you can buy and rent movies, for example, in both the iTunes Store and TV apps, as Apple tries to shift purchases to the latter.</p><p> Soon, all that will be left of the iTunes brand is the iTunes Store for music. And people buy much less music [than] in the past, having mostly shifted to streaming. Will the iTunes name finally fade away as music sales dwindle? It&#39;s hard to imagine Apple stopping digital music sales entirely; even if fewer people buy digital music, the market isn&#39;t dead, not by a long shot. Global digital music sales peaked in 2012 at around $4.4 billion, and in 2021 they had dropped to $1.1 billion. That&#39;s a decline of about 75%, but Apple still earns a hefty amount of money from selling digital music.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been wondering about the same thing for a few years. I purchase/rent all my movies and TV shows on my Apple TV, where “iTunes” isn&#39;t mentioned. (And in the age of streaming, I really only purchase/rent movies — the TV shows I watch are all streamed nowadays.) So why keep the iTunes Store app around on iOS — they could just add a Store tab to the Music app. Buy your music — if you buy music — in Music, and buy your movies in TV.</p><p> The only reason I can think not to do this is that the Music app is already so jam-packed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The End of iTunes?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_and_ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3j" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40303</id><published> 2023-10-23T22:33:57Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T00:37:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Speaking of</a> Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">he has an interesting bit about Apple&#39;s AI efforts in his latest Power On column</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The company has some catching up to do. Apple largely sat on the sidelines when OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT took off like a rocket last year. It watched as Google and Microsoft Corp. rolled out generative AI versions of their search engines, which spit out convincingly human-like responses to users&#39; queries. Microsoft also updated its Windows apps with smarter assistants, and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled an AI-enhanced overhaul of Alexa.</p><p> All the while, the only noteworthy AI release from Apple was an improved auto-correct system in iOS 17.</p></blockquote><p> I would argue that the improved autocorrect in iOS 17 is a major feature — in my use it&#39;s clearly an improvement, and autocorrect is a feature used every day, in almost every app, by almost every iOS user. It&#39;s one of the most used and most important features in the entire OS. I&#39;d also argue that Apple has done some terrific work with AI features in Photos. The search feature in Photos works <em>really</em> well.</p><p> But I think Gurman&#39;s summary does get at an essential truth. If I asked you “Which companies are at the forefront of AI-powered products?”, I doubt you&#39;d put Apple on the list. And AI is proving so useful — and yet is a nascent field — that Apple needs to soon be on that list, lest their products begin to fall behind competitively. “Which companies are best at integrating AI into products?” is going to be like “Which companies are best at creating hardware at scale?” and “Which companies are best at human interface design?”</p><p> Gurman continues:</p><blockquote><p> Now, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook says that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years. But I can tell you in no uncertain terms that Apple executives were caught off guard by the industry&#39;s sudden AI fever and have been scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time.</p><p> “There&#39;s a lot of anxiety about this and it&#39;s considered a pretty big miss internally,” a person with knowledge of the matter told Power On.</p><p> As I first reported in July, the company built its own large language model called Ajax and rolled out an internal chatbot dubbed “Apple GPT” to test out the functionality. The critical next step is determining if the technology is up to snuff with the competition and how Apple will actually apply it to its products.</p></blockquote><p> What I have heard from little birdies in Cupertino is <em>not</em> that there was a miss on this already. Apple is almost never at the forefront of stuff like this. They&#39;re a deliberate company. Their goal, as with any new technology, is to integrate it into products in meaningful ways <em>best</em> , not <em>first</em> . That&#39;s why there&#39;s no internal anxiety that they&#39;ve already missed anything related to AI.</p><p> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver, but that the company — if only for privacy reasons — will only use what comes from its own AI/ML team.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple and AI</title></entry><entry><title> Kolide — Device Trust for Okta </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40304</id><published> 2023-10-23T22:30:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T22:39:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is chock-a-block with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: drafting emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk: malware, data governance, and prompt injection attacks.</p><p> Kolide is taking a two-part approach to governing AI use: allowing you to draft AI policies <em>as a team</em> , and using Kolide to block malicious tools. <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Rumor Pundit Thunderdome </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40302</id><published> 2023-10-23T18:16:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T18:16:54Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors on Friday:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</p><p> Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.</p><p> Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a> , ruling out an update to the all-in-one desktop computer this year.

The current model launched in April 2021 and it is the only current-generation Mac left with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Gurman has repeatedly said that Apple&#39;s next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/">iMac will skip the M2</a> and feature the M3 chip instead, but he declined to mention which chip the new machine will feature in this newsletter.</p><p> Gurman noted that Apple retail stores are now in short supply of the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and many configurations now will not arrive until mid-November, in what he believes is “a clear sign that something is about to happen” regarding these three machines.</p></blockquote><p> Claim chowder tastes great with a side of popcorn.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Rumor Pundit Thunderdome’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> YouTube Music Is Now Available Natively on HomePods </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/youtube-music-integration-comes-to-homepod/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/homepod-youtube-music" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40301</id><published> 2023-10-23T17:46:17Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T17:48:19Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick, MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> YouTube Music is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9231765?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;oco=1#zippy=%2Capple-homepod">now available</a> directly on Apple&#39;s HomePod and HomePod mini, thanks to new Siri integration support in the YouTube Music app. The change means subscribers to the streaming service can now choose to use voice commands to start YouTube Music on a HomePod, without having to append “on YouTube Music” to every request.</p></blockquote><p> Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s support document for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/use-siri-to-play-music-on-homepod-apd3399d3179/homepod">using Siri to play music on HomePods</a> , which includes the (pretty simple) directions for setting a default music service.</p><p> There&#39;s a big — and to me, a little weird — difference between music services and streaming video services. Every streaming video service is available on almost every device capable of playing video. Whatever box or built-in “smart TV” software you&#39;re using in your living room, it almost certainly has access to every major streaming video service. When Apple TV+ launched in 2019, Apple already supported Samsung TVs, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">pre-announced versions for Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony, and Vizio</a> .</p><p> But with these smart audio devices, it&#39;s been more drip-by-drip. It seems clear that each of the major smart audio device makers — Apple with HomePod, Amazon with Alexa, and Google with their Nests — originally conceived of them as being companion products for the respective company&#39;s own music service, not open platforms. You can see how they&#39;d think that way: most people subscribe to multiple streaming video services, because each service has its own original shows and movies. But with music, most people subscribe to just one service, because each service pretty much has all popular music.</p><p> But in the long run it&#39;s better for everyone to do what&#39;s best for users, and clearly that means giving users a choice of which music service they want to use, no matter which hardware system they&#39;ve bought. Compete on quality and price, not lock-in.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘YouTube Music Is Now Available Natively on HomePods’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/homepod-youtube-music">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Alexa Fell for 2020 Election Crackpottery </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/07/amazon-alexa-news-2020-election-misinformation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/22/alexa-2020-election-crackpottery" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40300</id><published> 2023-10-22T17:38:39Z</published><updated> 2023-10-22T17:41:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica:</p><blockquote><p> An advertising industry group urged Comcast to stop its “10G” ads or modify them to state that 10G is an “aspirational” technology rather than something the company actually provides on its cable network today. The National Advertising Division (NAD), part of the advertising industry&#39;s self-regulatory system run by BBB National Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged by T-Mobile.</p><p> In its decision <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g">announced</a> Thursday, the NAD recommended that Comcast “discontinue its &#39;10G&#39; claims” or “modify its advertising to (a) make clear that it is implementing improvements that will enable it to achieve &#39;10G&#39; and that it is aspirational or (b) use &#39;10G&#39; in a manner that is not false or misleading, consistent with this decision.”</p><p> Comcast plans to appeal the decision, so it won&#39;t make any changes to marketing immediately. If Comcast loses the appeal and agrees to change its practices, it would affect more than just a few ads because Comcast now calls its entire broadband network “10G.”</p></blockquote><p> This is absolutely hilarious.

<p>Charlie Gile and Katherine Doyle, reporting for NBC News from Atlanta:</p><blockquote><p> Trump campaign legal adviser Kenneth Chesebro struck a deal with prosecutors from the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney&#39;s office in its 2020 election interference case on Friday.</p><p> Chesebro, who was charged alongside Donald Trump and more than a dozen other codefendants with attempting to delay the transfer of power after the 2020 election, was scheduled to stand trial this week. He accepted the offer as jury selection was underway on Friday, after 450 potential jurors had completed a lengthy questionnaire on what would be asked. He had rejected an earlier deal late last month.</p><p> Standing beside his attorney in court, Chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents and agreed to testify in the case as part of the deal.</p><p> The Trump attorney faces five years probation, a $5,000 fine, 100 hours of community service, and must continue to provide documents and evidence to the state, according to the terms of the deal.</p></blockquote><p> Yesterday crackpot Sidney “The Kraken” Powell <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/politics/sidney-powell-plea-takeaways/index.html">flipped</a> . Today, with Chesebro, they flipped a cooperating witness who isn&#39;t nuts. Prosecutors offer probation only when they&#39;re building a stronger case to send those higher up in the conspiracy to prison. If Rudy Giuliani has any sense he&#39;ll flip next.

<p>Joseph Simonson in The Washington Free Beacon, “NYU Law Students Say Classmate Losing Job Offer Over Pro-Hamas Statement Is &#39;Violence&#39;”:</p><blockquote><p> New York University law students are rallying behind a student who lost a spot at a white-shoe law firm for defending Hamas, saying the firm&#39;s decision to rescind their offer constitutes “violence.”</p><p> The Chicago-based Winston &amp; Strawn withdrew its offer of employment to Ryna Workman after the nonbinary NYU student issued a statement claiming “Israel bears full responsibility” for the terrorist attacks that have left more than 1,300 dead, including at least 30 Americans. The firm&#39;s decision is just one instance of “systemic, concentrated violence” Workman has experienced since issuing her anti-Israel pronouncement, according to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STpCTTPP2xLTyTJdFmHqxftF0jPb6jl30S_-ozqbdC4/edit">letter</a> of support obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.</p><p> The letter&#39;s signatories, which include the Black Allied Law Students Association and the Women of Color Collective, accuses NYU of being complicit “in the abuses of the Israeli government,” and condemns “the broader NYU administration for not protecting Ryna as a student and important member of our community.”</p></blockquote><p> Words have meaning. The far left has been mangling the definition of <em>violence</em> for years now, inverting the age old adage that sticks and stones can break your bones but words will never hurt you. Words can hurt, of course — deeply. But it&#39;s a different kind of hurt than pain and carnage inflicted through violence. We&#39;d be in a far better place if the only exchanges between Gaza and Israel were words, no matter how hateful those words be.</p><p> These students should be expelled from college, not placated. Misusing <em>violence</em> in this context — a terrorist attack that has killed 1,300 innocent Israelis, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-biden/card/latest-death-toll-in-israel-hamas-conflict-vGjRIHmG7vlGZUdBE5hn">maimed many thousands more</a> , and killed thousands of Palestinians in the resulting still-unfolding war — is outrageously offensive. Many of the dead can&#39;t be identified. They&#39;ve just been blown apart. That&#39;s violence. Everyone knows <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violence">what the word really means</a> — “the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy”. These left-wing nuts are obtusely pretending the word means something else for reasons that might surprise even Orwell, <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/">the master of identifying the decline of language in the name of politics</a> .

<p>I&#39;ve surfaced this 2013 gem from Forbes before, but it feels worth another link in light of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">that new Piper Sandler survey</a> pegging the iPhone&#39;s market share amongst US teens at a staggering 87 percent:</p><blockquote><p> Ultimately, in the eyes of today&#39;s youth, massive popularity has watered down Apple&#39;s coolness. “Teens are telling us Apple is done,” says Tina Wells of the youth marketing agency Buzz Marketing Group. “Apple has done a great job of embracing Gen X and older [Millennials], but I don&#39;t think they are connecting with Millennial kids. [They&#39;re] all about Surface tablets/laptops and Galaxy.”</p></blockquote><p> This take looks really goofy 10 years later, but at the time, there was a really strong, persistent media narrative that Apple couldn&#39;t thrive without Steve Jobs, and that Samsung in particular was going to surpass them. 2013 was the year of Phil Schiller&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple">Can&#39;t innovate any more, my ass</a> ” ad lib during the WWDC keynote.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Vintage 2013 Claim Chowder: ‘Is Apple’s iPhone No Longer Cool to Teens?’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/claim-chowder-iphone-cool">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Color Palettes From Dieter Rams Products for Braun </title><link href="https://www.presentandcorrect.com/blogs/blog/rams-palette" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/rams-palette" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40295</id><published> 2023-10-18T23:46:38Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T23:46:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/apple-announces-new-apple-pencil-with-magnetic-storage-and-usb-c-port/">Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This pencil is clearly designed for use with the tenth-generation iPad: while it attaches magnetically to the long edge of the iPad for storage, it still charges via a physical port. Unlike the old Lightning model, which had a removable (and easily lost) cap hiding its charging and pairing connector, the new Apple Pencil features an innovative sliding design that reveals a USB-C port into which you can plug a cable (which, naturally, is <em>not</em> included). Its design is otherwise very similar to the second-generation Pencil.</p><p> At $79, this Pencil is cheaper than both the first-generation model at $99 and the second-generation model at $129. But that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t have all the features of <em>either</em> of them: it lacks the pressure sensitivity of either of the previous models, as well as the double-tap controls, wireless pairing and charging, and free engraving of the second-generation. However, the new Pencil <em>does</em> support the “hover” feature on M2 iPad Pro models.</p></blockquote><p> On the one hand, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUWA3AM/A/apple-pencil-usb-c">this new Pencil</a> makes complete sense. Lightning is quickly fading away, and this new slider seems like a much better design than the old cap. On the other hand, though, the fact that there are now <em>three</em> Apple Pencil models, all with different features and which are supported by different iPads, exemplifies just how over-complicated the iPad product lineup is.</p><p> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/the-price-of-apples-old-products-strategy/">Jason Snell hits that point in his own take</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Still, it&#39;s hard to look at the shenanigans in the iPad product line over the last few years and not get the sense that things are kind of a mess. This new Pencil should&#39;ve shipped last year with the 10th-generation iPad. The new iPad has features that higher-end models don&#39;t. There&#39;s insufficient differentiation between the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. (Leaving old models aside, it just feels like there are too many iPads, doesn&#39;t it?)</p><p> It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re witnessing a reset, however. There hasn&#39;t been a single new iPad announcement this year, and given Tuesday&#39;s Apple Pencil announcement, it sure feels like there won&#39;t be one. Perhaps 2024 will bring us a new wave of iPads that will finally make the product line make more sense. But don&#39;t get your hopes up too much: Apple will probably still keep selling some old models, too. It&#39;s what today&#39;s Apple does.</p></blockquote><p> Off the top of my head, what I&#39;d like from Apple on the iPad front next year:</p><ul><li> Drop the old 9th-gen iPad from the lineup. That iPad is so old it still has a home button.</li><li> Lower the price of the 10th-gen iPad by $100. (And maybe give it a speed bump from the A14 to A15 chip? But it&#39;s probably wishful thinking to hope for a price cut <em>and</em> a newer chip.)</li><li> Update the iPad Air (and Mini?) models to be more like today&#39;s iPad Pros, with Face ID instead of Touch ID. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-18"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-18">1</a></sup></li><li> Major revision of the iPad Pros, which haven&#39;t seen a major form factor change since 2018. Put more <em>pro</em> in the iPad Pros, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video">just like Apple has done</a> with the iPhone 15 Pro models.</li><li> Update the Magic Keyboard, ideally in a way that continues to support both iPad Airs and 11-inch iPad Pros. The Magic Keyboard is a great idea, and I think a popular one. But it ought to be better — thinner, lighter, and more durable. (The white ones especially age quickly. Keep your eyes out for them in the wild, in cafes and airports — they often look quite grungy. Compare and contrast with MacBooks, which often look great even after years of daily use.) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-magic-keyboard-aluminum-laptop/">Mark Gurman has reported</a> that just such a revision to the Magic Keyboard is in the works.</li></ul><p> That would clarify the iPad&#39;s three tiers: good (regular iPad, 10th-gen), better (iPad Air — the best choice for most people), and best (iPad Pros, with advanced new features and capabilities). The point should be to make the question “ <em>Which iPad should I buy?</em> ” as easy to answer as possible. I think Apple <em>has</em> made that question pretty easy to answer for iPhones, MacBooks, and Watches — and for peripherals like AirPods. <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-18"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-18">2</a></sup> Now do it for iPads.</p><p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol></p><p><li id="fn1-2023-10-18"><p> It feels like a very safe assumption that the issue here is cost: Face ID components are expensive, so the non-Pro iPads are saddled with Touch ID buttons instead. I&#39;m sure there are many happy iPad Air owners who aren&#39;t bothered by Touch ID. But if you&#39;ve ever used an iPad Pro with Face ID, it&#39;s impossible not to be annoyed when using an iPad Air. Face ID isn&#39;t just a different form of bio-authentication than Touch ID, it a clearly superior one. When I&#39;ve reviewed them, it&#39;s been a large focus of my attention. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_ipad_air">From my year-ago review of the current iPad Air</a> :</p><blockquote><p> For <em>me</em> , Face ID alone is worth $150. I use my iPad in a Magic Keyboard frequently, perhaps even a majority of the time. It&#39;s my kitchen computer. And I find using Touch ID on the power button somewhat awkward when the iPad Air is in the Magic Keyboard. But the Magic Keyboard is a $300 peripheral. It&#39;s not a niche product but it&#39;s certainly not for everyone. iPads are fundamentally handheld tablets, and handheld, the iPad Air&#39;s Touch ID instead of Face ID is much less of a difference. I still decidedly prefer Face ID, though. Touch ID on the iPad Air makes it feel easy to unlock. Face ID on the iPad Pro makes it seems like it wasn&#39;t even locked in the first place.</p></blockquote><p> With iPhones, Face ID is now in every model they sell but the SE. That&#39;s how it ought to be for iPads too: in every one of them but the price-focused entry model. It&#39;s too good of a feature, and a key advantage for iPads when compared to MacBooks. <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎︎</a></p><p></li></p><p><li id="fn2-2023-10-18"></p><p> The one weird MacBook is the 13-inch MacBook Pro. From a purely logical perspective, I don&#39;t think Apple should even sell that device. The M2 MacBook Air is cheaper, lighter, and equally capable. Study <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Air-M2,MacBookPro-13-M2,MacBook-Pro-14-M2">Apple&#39;s tech spec comparison page for 13/14-inch MacBooks</a> and it&#39;s hard to find a reason to recommend the 13-inch MacBook Pro. But I do think it sells surprisingly well. My theory is that there&#39;s a segment of the market that would be served better by the MacBook Air but who believe that they need a “Pro” MacBook. The specs don&#39;t matter to them — it&#39;s the name. Or maybe there are a surprising number of Touch Bar fans out there? <a href="#fnr2-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎</a></p><p></li></p><p></ol></div></p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ There&#39;s a New Apple Pencil With a USB-C Port, and My Thoughts Turn to the Complexity of the Overall iPad Lineup </title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v39" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/10/kolide_--_device_trust_for_okt_5" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40293</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-10-18T22:06:08Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T22:06:08Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>It seems like every company is scrambling to stake their claim in the AI goldrush — check out the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/the-ceo-of-kroger-mentioned-ai-8-times-on-the-company-s-earnings-call#xj4y7vzkg">CEO of Kroger promising</a> to bring LLMs into the dairy aisle. And front line workers are following suit–experimenting with AI so they can work faster and do more.</p><p> In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is overflowing with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: punching up emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk.</p><ol><li> <strong>Malware:</strong> Security researchers keep uncovering <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/beware-ai-scams-meta-blocks-1000-plus-links-tied-to-chatgpt-themed-malware">AI-based extensions</a> that steal user data. These extensions play on users&#39; trust of the big tech platforms (“it can&#39;t be dangerous if Google lets it on the Chrome store!”) and they often appear to work, by hooking up to ChatGPT et al&#39;s APIs.</li><li> <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Companies including Apple and Verizon have banned their employees from using LLMs because these products rarely offer a guarantee that a user&#39;s inputs won&#39;t be used as training data.</li><li> <strong>Prompt Injection Attacks:</strong> In this little known but <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">potentially unsolvable attack</a> , hidden text on a webpage directs an AI tool to perform malicious actions–such as exfiltrate data and then delete the records.</li></ol><p> Up until now, most companies have been caught flat-footed by AI, but these risks are too serious to ignore.</p><p> At Kolide, we&#39;re taking a two-part approach to governing AI use.</p><ol><li> <strong>Draft AI policies as a team.</strong> We don&#39;t want to totally ban our team from using AI, we just want to use it safely. So our first step is meeting with representatives from multiple teams to figure out what they&#39;re getting out of AI-based tools, and how we can provide them with secure options that don&#39;t expose critical data or infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>Use Kolide to block malicious tools.</strong> Kolide lets IT and security teams write <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3PJW32Q">Checks that detect device compliance issues</a> , and we&#39;ve already started creating Checks for malicious (or dubious) AI-based tools. Now if an employee accidentally downloads malware, they&#39;ll be prevented from logging into our cloud apps until they&#39;ve removed it.</li></ol><p> Every company will have to craft policies based on their unique needs and concerns, but the important thing is to start now. There&#39;s still time to seize the reins of AI, before it gallops away with your company&#39;s data.</p><p> To learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">click here to watch an on-demand demo</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta.

<p>Notable results from Piper Sandler&#39;s survey of over 9,000 US teenagers:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p> 70% of teens have used Spotify over the last six months (up from 68%), with 46% of teens opting to subscribe/pay for Spotify (up from 44%)</p></li><li><p> TikTok improved slightly as the favorite social platform (38% share) by 80 bps vs. spring &#39;23. SNAP was No. 2 with 28% share, followed by Instagram (23%)</p></li><li><p> Teens spend 28.7% of daily video consumption on Netflix (-220 bps vs. spring &#39;23) and 29.1% on YouTube (+100 bps vs. spring &#39;23)</p></li><li><p> 87% of teens own an iPhone; 88% expect an iPhone to be their next phone; 34% own an Apple Watch</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> The iPhone&#39;s market share among US teenagers has been remarkably high for as long as I can remember such surveys. Years ago, though, there was a split between how many teens actually <em>had</em> an iPhone vs. how many wanted one for their next phone. Now those numbers are effectively even. I suspect this is the primary driving force in the iPhone&#39;s continuing market share growth in the US It&#39;s easy to think only short-term and believe that just about everyone who might ever get a phone already has one, but there are teenagers (and pre-teens) getting their first phone <em>every</em> day.</p><p> That teens spend slightly more time every day watching video on YouTube than on Netflix isn&#39;t surprising, at least if you&#39;ve observed any teens recently. But it&#39;s rather remarkable given how different their business models are. Netflix spends a veritable fortune on new original content and old library content. YouTube content is mostly uploaded from users and content creators <em>for free</em> .</p><p> I&#39;d be curious to know if there&#39;s a noticeable split between which devices teens use to watch video on different services. Like, maybe YouTube viewing skews more toward watching on their iPhones, but Netflix on bigger-screen devices like laptops and iPads? TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram are surely viewed almost entirely on their iPhones.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Piper Sandler’s Annual ‘Taking Stock With Teens’ Survey’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Log Is the “Pro” in iPhone 15 Pro&#39; </title><link href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v37" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40291</id><published> 2023-10-18T21:40:45Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T21:40:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> When a customer buys a new iPhone from an Apple retail store, the device sometimes comes with outdated software. For instance, the first iPhone 15 models out of the factory shipped with iOS 17, but iOS 17.0.1 was already available by the time the devices were available for purchase. Buying a new iPhone without the latest software isn&#39;t ideal, especially if there are some high-profile bugs. But that situation is about to change.</p><p> Apple is planning a new system for its retail stores that will update the software on iPhones prior to sale. The company has developed a proprietary pad-like device that the store can place boxes of iPhones on top of. That system can then wirelessly turn on the iPhone, update its software and then power it back down — all without the phone&#39;s packaging ever being opened. The company aims to begin rolling this out to its stores before the end of the year.</p></blockquote><p> Fascinating idea, but I have so many questions. What exactly is the trigger here? Something related to MagSafe? When the system is put into place, will it work with existing still-in-the-box iPhones or will it only work with <em>new</em> units, that ship from the factory running iOS 17.2 or whatever? Will the same system eventually come to other products, like iPads and Apple Watches? Maybe even Macs?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gurman: Apple Is Readying System to Apply Software Updates to Still-in-Box iPhones’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/gurman-inbox-software-update">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iMazing 3: Coming Soon </title><link href="https://imazing.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=imazing3beta&amp;coupon=FIREBALL-IMAZING3" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v35" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/15/imazing-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40289</id><published> 2023-10-15T22:23:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-15T22:23:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>David Pierce, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Eddy Cue, in a dark suit, peered down at the monitor in front of him. The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly malfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the tech was up and running — showing an image of three iPhones, each demonstrating a part of the phone&#39;s setup process. Cue squinted down at the screen.</p><p> “The resolution on this is terrible,” he said. “You should get a Mac.” That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, “If Apple would like to make a donation…” That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business.</p></blockquote><p> Genuinely funny, and genuinely an Eddy Cue moment.</p><blockquote><p> Meagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he would have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn&#39;t agree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he&#39;d never really considered that an option: “I always felt like it was in Google&#39;s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.” Cue also argued that the deal was about more than economics and that Apple never seriously considered switching to another provider or building its own search product. “Certainly there wasn&#39;t a valid alternative to Google at the time,” Cue said. He said there still isn&#39;t one.</p></blockquote><p> Here we get to the heart of the matter. Say what you will about alternatives like Bing and DuckDuckGo (which is powered by Bing results), but they are — I say — at least “valid” alternatives to Google for web search. I&#39;ve been using Kagi — <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/plan-types.html">a paid search engine with plans starting at $5/month</a> — for about a year and there&#39;s no question in my mind that I&#39;m getting as good or <em>better</em> results than I do from Google for the overwhelming majority of my searches. Apple <em>could</em> switch, quality-wise. Whether they could switch and maintain any semblance of the profits they reap from their deal with Google, I do not know.</p><p> So as Google&#39;s search result quality deteriorates — but their ability to monetize their search monopoly remains strong — Apple looks bad too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Eddy Cue in Court, Defending Apple’s Lucrative Search Deal With Google’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/12/cue-apple-google">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> President Biden on the Terrorist Attacks in Israel </title><link href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cho6JtMTYXg" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v33" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/11/biden-israel" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40287</id><published> 2023-10-11T17:59:47Z</published><updated> 2023-10-11T18:03:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>John Kelly, writing for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The ad was for a Whopper Jr. promotion. The conceit was that you could get two of the baby burgers for a mere $5: one for you and one for a friend. But — spoiler alert! — you&#39;d probably want to consume the pair yourself. Or, as the text on the screen put it:</p><p> JK YOU<br /> ATE &#39;EM<br /> BOTH</p><p> I grabbed my remote, rewound, paused and took a photo. This was the Zapruder film to me, even if the JK stood for “Just kidding,” not “John Kelly.”</p><p> This must not stand, or — to keep with the theme — it mustn&#39;t stand.</p></blockquote><p> This sort of mistake drives me nuts, and I spot such wrongly-curled apostrophes instantly. To me it&#39;s as glaring a mistake as a misspelled word. So god bless Kelly for griping about it in a column in The Washington Post. (I&#39;d argue that perhaps it&#39;s correct for Burger King to use the wrong apostrophe, as a signifier of the care with which they prepare their food.)</p><p> But Kelly doesn&#39;t mention the obvious explanation for how this happens: automatic smart quote algorithms that aren&#39;t smart enough, in the hands of ignorant designers who don&#39;t have an eye for typography. If you type:</p><pre> <code>&#39;em&#39; dashes and &#39;en&#39; dashes</code></pre><p> you want the apostrophe before <em>em</em> to be an opening single quote, the one shaped like a 6 in most typefaces.

<p>Dan Moren, also at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> That second agent proved quite capable, not only agreeing that the situation was strange, but also looking into issues on Apple&#39;s side. Which led to the somewhat bizarre conclusion of this story: after perhaps 20 minutes on the phone, he seemed to hit on something. I heard him laugh and say something along the lines of “that explains it” and then, with my consent, put me on hold. When he came back, he said — and I&#39;m not exactly quoting, but close enough: “I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t tell you any more than this, but all your services should be back up pretty much exactly 12 hours after they went down.” [...]</p><p> So I waited the rest of the day. At this point, I had received no email since the early morning, and a number of my other apps — though not all — were non-functional. It made me realize just how much of my life was dependent on Apple&#39;s online services — a somewhat sobering proposition.</p><p> I spent the next few hours largely offline, but kept an eye on the clock. And, sure enough, at 9pm on the dot, everything flipped back on: all my Find My friends showed up, my email started slowly trickling in, and I was able to finally fully log back into my iCloud account on my MacBook Air — just in time to go to bed.</p></blockquote><p> What a strange and maddening situation.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Black Box of iCloud’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/moren-icloud-black-box">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jason Snell Reviews the iPhones 15 Pro </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/review-iphone-15-pro-pro-max/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/snell-iphones-15-pro" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40281</id><published> 2023-10-09T22:28:23Z</published><updated> 2023-10-09T22:28:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> I recently went to a football game (it was a beautiful day in Berkeley, California) and was trying to figure out where my wife had gone — we were separately looking for concessions amid the rattle and hum of a busy stadium walkway. Then I remembered we both had new iPhone 15 models, and I opened Find My — the app that lets you find all that you can&#39;t leave behind — and enabled the remarkable new UWB-powered feature that lets you find nearby friends. Not only did I almost immediately discover that she was to my right (so I began heading that way), but she was also notified that I was looking for her. We found each other and had fun doing it!</p></blockquote><p> I neglected to mention this feature in my review, but I tested it, and it really did work as advertised.

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it. The user chooses when to restart, but if they don&#39;t fix the problem by a predetermined deadline, they&#39;re unable to authenticate with Okta.</p><p> <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Watch Kolide&#39;s on-demand demo</a> to learn more about how it enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Snopes Shows the Folly of X&#39;s New Link Presentation </title><link href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/musk-biden-transgender-died/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/snopes-twitter" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40279</id><published> 2023-10-07T00:52:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T17:11:30Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Another change this week at Twitter/X: they&#39;ve stopped showing the headline for links in tweets. Jordan Liles, writing at Snopes under the splendid headline “Did Elon Musk Endorse Biden, Come Out as Transgender, and Die of Suicide?”:</p><blockquote><p> On Oct. 5, 2023, a user on X named Armand Domalewski posted that the social media platform&#39;s owner, Elon Musk, had announced his endorsement of US President Joe Biden for a second term in the White House. “Elon Musk endorses Joe Biden for re-election,” the post read alongside a picture of Musk smiling.</p><p> However, this news was not true. Domalewski had created the <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmandDoma/status/1709827419031691620">post</a> ( <a href="https://archive.ph/yIIJG">archived</a> ) as somewhat of a satirical example of a recent decision made by X that removes visible headlines from posts that contain links.</p><p> The link in the post, which was only displayed as “Fortune.com,” led to an <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/21/elon-musk-plans-remove-headlines-news-articles-link-shared-on-x-twitter/">article</a> with a headline that could only be read if users visited the website. That headline: “Elon Musk plans to remove headlines from news articles shared on X.”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693843680904216619">Musk&#39;s stated reason</a> for the change: “Will greatly improve the esthetics.”</p><p> This justification, as Liles&#39;s piece at Snopes exemplifies, is of course nonsense. Either show the full preview card, including the original site&#39;s headline, or don&#39;t show anything except the original URL. That&#39;s the way Twitter worked for years: the full URL itself was visible in the tweet. But Twitter is now showing neither the original headline nor the URL, just the domain name of the source, along with the URL&#39;s preview card <em>image</em> .</p><p> Clarity, in all things, is the height of aesthetic achievement. The best link presentation is the one that makes it the most clear where it will take you. What X is presenting today is obfuscating, not clarifying, and thus grotesque.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Snopes Shows the Folly of X’s New Link Presentation’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/snopes-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> X Rolls Out New &#39;Chumbox&#39; Ad Format — Post-Like Things That Can&#39;t Be Reported or Blocked </title><link href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-x-new-clickbait-ad-format" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/x-chumbox" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40278</id><published> 2023-10-07T00:33:11Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T00:33:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Matt Binder, reporting for Mashable:</p><blockquote><p> Mashable has confirmed this ad format with numerous users from across X and have seen a variety of different ads running this bizarre new format that just consists of written copy text, a photo, and a fake avatar that&#39;s sole purpose is to make the ad look like an organically posted tweet.</p><p> The type of content being promoted in the ads that Mashable has viewed appear to be consistent with ads found in spammy, low quality “ <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/"><em>chumbox</em></a> ” advertising — typically defined as those clickbait ads found at the bottom of posts on content farm sites — made popular by native ad networks like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fake-news-outbrain-taboola-hillary-clinton"><em>Taboola</em></a> .</p><p> “This Seems Unbelievable, But Happens in Dubai Everyday” reads one ad that takes users to a third-party content mill website, overloaded with ads of its own. “These Incredibly Cool Gadgets That Are Going To Sell Out This Year.

<p>The Verge, as usual, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup/">has a wonderful page summarizing everything announced or demoed at yesterday&#39;s Pixel event</a> , including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00uU6PdTjKE">a 15-minute summary video</a> . The Verge is so good at things like this, I dare describe them as indispensable.</p><p> At the highest level it&#39;s impossible not to draw a direct comparison to Apple&#39;s iPhone 15 event last month. The two companies announced the exact same slate of products:</p><ul><li> New flagship phones, both Pro and non-pro</li><li> New smartwatches</li><li> New wireless earbuds with AR noise filtering features</li></ul><p> New phones, new watches, new earbuds. The Apple and Google versions of these products are all direct competitors to each other. No normal person buys both an iPhone and a Pixel, or both an Apple Watch and Pixel Watch, or both AirPods Pro and Pixel Buds Pro. But it&#39;s more profound than that. Practically speaking, no one mixes and matches these products. Why would anyone? If you own an iPhone, it&#39;s hard to think of a single reason why you&#39;d try to pair it with a Pixel Watch or Pixel Buds. And if your phone is a Pixel, you <em>can&#39;t</em> even pair it with an Apple Watch.</p><p> As I wrote about Apple&#39;s event last month, these three product categories go together. They form an ecosystem of truly personal computing devices: the ones we take with us nearly everywhere, which work together in ways that just don&#39;t apply to other devices. There are zillions of people who own the Apple triumvirate — iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods — who use a PC laptop and something other than an Apple TV box for streaming. And there are surely plenty of Android users who use a MacBook. A Mac <em>can</em> be a great device for use in Google&#39;s overall ecosystem.</p><p> It&#39;s also impossible not to comment on just how much less interest there is in Google&#39;s Pixel ecosystem. Google&#39;s event garnered only a sliver of the attention Apple&#39;s did, and their devices, similarly, have only a fraction of the sales Apple&#39;s do. On the one hand I&#39;m tempted to say the difference is just commensurate with how much better at hardware Apple is than Google. But I think there&#39;s more to it than that. There&#39;s something ineffable about it. There are aspects of marketshare traction — in any market — that can&#39;t be explained by side-by-side product comparisons alone.</p><p> For a long time, Apple just couldn&#39;t regain traction in the PC market. Even after Mac OS X was released, even after the Jobs/Ive regime had restored both <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/04/the-mac-product-grid/">sense</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808948/imac-twenty-five-visual-history-apple-design-models">panache</a> to the hardware lineup, it seemed like the best Apple could do was tread water, marketshare-wise. But they kept at it. We remember the long-running “Get a Mac” ad campaign with Justin Long (“I&#39;m a Mac”) and John Hodgman (“and I&#39;m a PC”) not just because it was clever but because it really did coincide with a reversal of fortune for the Mac in the market. People really did start switching from Windows PCs. So great was Windows&#39;s market share that here we are 17 years after the start of that ad campaign and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/apples-mac-market-share-jumped-even-though-pc-sales-fell-for-the-sixth-consecutive-quarter.html">the Mac continues to grow</a> .</p><p> Are Google&#39;s Pixel devices — the phones especially — ever going to have such a moment? I just don&#39;t see it happening. Most tellingly, they don&#39;t even take much share of the US <em>Android</em> market, let alone the US smartphone market, let alone the worldwide phone market. Here&#39;s 9to5Google, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/28/google-pixel-us-q2-2023-shipments/">reporting back in July regarding a market share report from Counterpoint</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Through that, though, Apple actually managed to up its share of the overall US smartphone market in Q2 2023 by 10%. That takes the iPhone to a 55% share of overall shipments, with Android brands competing for the remaining 45%. Apple has had higher numbers prior, hitting 57% in Q4 of last year, but there&#39;s still a clear trend where Android is continuing to lose ground.</p><p> However, Google Pixel managed to be a bright spot throughout. Pixel shipments in the US grew by 48% year-over-year in Q2, the only major brand that managed to do so. That&#39;s still a mere 3% of shipments over the quarter, but that&#39;s also during a time where only a single Pixel device actually launched.</p></blockquote><p> 3 percent market share in the US — Pixel&#39;s best market — is a pretty dim “bright spot”. I don&#39;t know how anyone could compute this, other than anecdata observed in Mountain View cafeterias, but I&#39;d wager that more Google employees carry an iPhone than carry a Pixel. There was a trend on Threads last week where — inspired by Linda Yaccarino showing the world that she didn&#39;t have the X app on her iPhone&#39;s home screen — people were showing screenshots of their own home screens. It struck me, watching them scroll by, just how many people have multiple Google apps among their most-used iOS apps — Maps, Gmail, Chrome. That&#39;s a sign of strength for Google, as a company, but it&#39;s obviously a hindrance to getting iPhone users invested in Google&#39;s overall ecosystem to switch their phone to a Pixel. The best software from Google is available on all phones; the best from Apple is only available on iPhones. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-05"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-05">1</a></sup></p><p> Something is just missing from the Pixel&#39;s potential appeal, and I don&#39;t think it was announced yesterday. I really am glad that Google seemingly remains committed to its Pixel devices, but I just don&#39;t see the angle that&#39;s going to change their popularity. I suspect I could save this column and publish it a year from now instead of today, and barely change a word.</p><hr /><p> The most striking features Google announced yesterday were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup/">regarding AI-assisted photography</a> . “Magic Editor” lets you move and remove objects and people. “Best Take” is a feature I&#39;ve long wished for yet still feel uneasy about: if you snap multiple photos of a group of people, Best Take will choose the “best” face for each person from the group of images, merging them into a single, well, best take. For decades we&#39;ve all been able to do this manually using Photoshop and other image editors, and merging multiple image captures into a single resulting “photo” is how features like HDR work. But Google seems more willing to brush aside any ethical concerns about what exactly a <em>photograph</em> is. On Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/Cx-3qcLrQH8">Nilay Patel wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google is framing its new AI camera tools as making “memories” not photos which... run this to the end and it&#39;s just a camera designed to tell lies about what really happened. I don&#39;t know that any news organization can accept journalistic photos from a Pixel 8 at this point.</p></blockquote><p> The difference from something like HDR is that even if HDR is generating one image from multiple sensor readings, the purpose is to more accurately reflect what the photographer&#39;s eyes actually saw, from that vantage point, at that moment in time. Pixel phone photography is racing ahead to a world where images reflect moments that never actually were. Is the purpose of a camera to capture things as they were, or as they should have been?</p><p> Is that dishonest? Is all of digital photography headed in this direction, inevitably, and Google is just willing to blaze the trail that everyone else will soon enough follow?我不知道。 But it was the segment of yesterday&#39;s event that most struck me: technically impressive, but ethically blithe.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-05"><p> Try this on for an analogy: Google treats its entire Pixel portfolio like Apple treats Apple TV hardware. They make the best parts of it available on other platforms, greatly reducing the perceived value of their own hardware. Why switch to a Pixel when almost all of Google&#39;s apps are available on iOS? Why switch to an Apple TV box when the TV app and iTunes Store are built into your “smart” TV? <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Google&#39;s Pixel 8 Launch Event</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
