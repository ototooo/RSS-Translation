They&#39;ve added some rather superficial features to Messages ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/create-genmoji-with-apple-intelligence-iph4e76f5667/ios">Genmoji</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104970">message effects</a> for example), so I agree with Green that they <em>ought</em> to tackle disappearing messages and that surely they can find a way to do it where the added complexity doesn&#39;t create confusion. It&#39;s a hard challenge, to be sure, but a worthy one. Apple&#39;s designers could really have some fun with this too, with novel ways to present “disappearingness” visually.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Matthew Green: ‘Dear Apple: Add “Disappearing Messages” to iMessage Right Now’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Apologizes for Error That Flooded Instagram With a Bit of the Old Ultra-Violence </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-apologizes-for-error-that-flooded-instagram-with-violent-content-c207d5f5" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w48" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-ultra-violence" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41624</id><published> 2025-03-01T00:40:41Z</published><updated> 2025-03-03T16:24:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at Microsoft:</p><blockquote><p> In order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub.</p></blockquote><p>美国国家公共电台：</p><blockquote><p> Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/05/10/136169545/skype-microsofts-8-5-billion-mobile-bet">acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion</a> , announced in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Skype/status/1895477868261412953">X</a> on Friday that the iconic voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service would soon go dark. It encouraged Skype users to instead migrate to a free version of Microsoft Teams — a communication app that helps users work together in real time.</p><p> In the more than two decades since it was founded, Skype has been largely overtaken by a bevy of competitors, such as FaceTime, WhatsApp, Zoom, and Slack.</p></blockquote><p> The writing has been on the wall for a long time that Skype was no longer strategic for Microsoft. Really, even right after the acquisition, it never seemed Microsoft had any sort of plan for what to do with Skype — even though, at the time, it was their largest-ever acquisition.</p><p> But man, for a long while, Skype was singularly amazing, offering high-quality / low-latency audio calls at a time when everything else seemed low-quality / high-latency. I continued using Skype to record The Talk Show until a few years ago, and I can&#39;t say I miss it. But I used Skype to record at least around 400 episodes — which means I&#39;ve spent somewhere around 1,000 hours talking to people over Skype. I can close my eyes and just <em>hear</em> Skype&#39;s kinda clunky but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsUyjzRIU9w">distinctive ringtone</a> . In the early days of podcasting, seemingly <em>every</em> show used Skype because it was so much better than anything else. And it was free! It felt like the future. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an exaggeration to say that if not for Skype, podcasting would&#39;ve been set back several years.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Microsoft to Retire Skype in May’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/microsoft-skype-eol">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Fired &#39;Roughly 20&#39; Employees for Leaking </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/labor/621059/meta-fires-20-employee-leakers" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w46" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-fires-leakers" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41622</id><published> 2025-02-28T23:08:23Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T23:08:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Meta has fired “roughly 20” employees who leaked “confidential information outside the company,” according to a spokesperson.</p><p> “We tell employees when they join the company, and we offer periodic reminders, that it is against our policies to leak internal information, no matter the intent,” Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold tells The Verge exclusively. “We recently conducted an investigation that resulted in roughly 20 employees being terminated for sharing confidential information outside the company, and we expect there will be more. We take this seriously, and will continue to take action when we identify leaks.”</p></blockquote><p> These firings, of course, are the follow-up to one of my favorite headlines so far this year: “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/meta-warns-leakers-in-leaked-memo">Meta Warns That It Will Fire Leakers in Leaked Memo</a> ”. As I wrote in that post a month ago:</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s not fear of getting fired that keeps employees at most companies from leaking. It&#39;s that they find themselves aligned with the company&#39;s mission. They feel like part of a team that they want to see succeed, and they naturally adopt an attitude of being a team player. Team players don&#39;t leak the playbook because they don&#39;t like the coach&#39;s play-calling or how much playing time they&#39;re getting. I&#39;ve never gotten the sense that that sort of attitude exists at Meta.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m not sure this public crackdown will help. Meta seems to be leaning into fear to keep employees in line, rather than team spirit. Their war on leakers might prove about as effective as <a href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/four-decades-counting-continued-failure-war-drugs">America&#39;s decades-long “war on drugs”</a> , that saw illegal drug use <em>rise</em> , not fall, even while our prisons filled up with non-violent drug-law offenders. What&#39;s the Princess Leia line? “The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.” One longtime reader, who works at Netflix, contacted me after my month ago post and observed:</p><blockquote><p> That is such a great take on Meta&#39;s leaks. Netflix stuff almost never leaks, because Netflix is a place full of people who don&#39;t want to leak things. There are virtually no barriers, just a culture and collection of people who don&#39;t do that.</p></blockquote><p> Penalties are a deterrence. But the reason most people don&#39;t commit crimes — whether it be shoplifting or murder — isn&#39;t fear of the potential penalties. It&#39;s that they&#39;re good honest people who don&#39;t want to steal (and definitely don&#39;t want to kill anyone).</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Meta Fired ‘Roughly 20’ Employees for Leaking’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-fires-leakers">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Framework Introduces New Laptops and First Desktop </title><link href="https://frame.work/blog/highlights-from-the-framework-2nd-gen-event" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w45" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/framework-introduces-new-laptops-and-first-desktop" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41621</id><published> 2025-02-28T22:39:22Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T23:08:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Founder Nirav Patel, writing this week on Framework&#39;s company blog:</p><blockquote><p> We went live this morning at the Framework (2nd Gen) Event with our biggest set of announcements yet: <a href="https://frame.work/desktop">Framework Desktop</a> , <a href="https://frame.work/laptop12">Framework Laptop 12</a> , and the new Ryzen AI 300 Series <a href="https://frame.work/laptop13">Framework Laptop 13</a> . You can watch a recording of the livestream on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FrameworkComputer">YouTube channel</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Sean Hollister has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190757/modular-laptops-repairable-upgradable-diy">a good roundup of the announcements</a> at The Verge. Back in 2021 when Framework debuted with their first laptop, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/the-framework-laptop">I expressed pithy skepticism</a> regarding their modular approach. I&#39;m still skeptical, but it&#39;s hard not to root for them and cheer for their success. In principle, Framework&#39;s “everything is a swappable, replaceable module” approach to system design is a fun nerdy throwback to the days when it was expected that you could get inside any computer and replace or upgrade its components yourself. And Framework&#39;s style of modularity is designed with ease-of-use in mind, like snapping Lego blocks together. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">as Hollister points out</a> , Framework still hasn&#39;t shipped a promised GPU upgrade component for its now two-year-old Framework 16 laptop.</p><p> Also of note is how much Framework is building around chips <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/amd-in-everything-0ec0cc6e">from AMD</a> , not Intel. Is there a single category where anyone would say “Intel makes the best chips for this”? In an alternate universe where Apple had never moved the Mac to Apple Silicon, I&#39;m not sure if it would be tenable for Apple to still be exclusively relying on Intel for x86 chips. Intel&#39;s chips just aren&#39;t competitive with AMD&#39;s.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Framework Introduces New Laptops and First Desktop’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/framework-introduces-new-laptops-and-first-desktop">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump Claims to Have Spoken With Starmer Regarding Apple Encryption Backdoor Demand </title><link href="https://thespectator.com/topic/spectator-interview-president-donald-trump-full-transcript/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w44" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/trump-domenech-interview" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41620</id><published> 2025-02-28T18:19:53Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T21:03:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ben Domenech interviewed President Trump yesterday in the Oval Office, after Trump&#39;s meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Spectator has published the entire transcript, and I read it so you don&#39;t have to, to get the part about Apple and the UK&#39;s encryption backdoor demand:</p><blockquote><p> BD: But the problem is he runs, your vice president obviously eloquently pointed this out in Munich, he runs a nation now that is removing the security helmets on Apple phones so that they can —</p><p> DJT: We told them you can&#39;t do this.</p><p> BD: Yeah, Tulsi, I saw —</p><p> DJT: We actually told him… that&#39;s incredible. That&#39;s something, you know, that you hear about with China.</p></blockquote><p> It feels quite odd to strongly agree with Trump on something, but he&#39;s not wrong about everything.</p><p> (Most of the interview is just bananas stuff, ping-ponging all over the place. I swear Trump even goes back to Hannibal Lecter, and his mistaken belief that political asylum policies are somehow related to foreign countries emptying their asylums for the criminally insane.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Trump Claims to Have Spoken With Starmer Regarding Apple Encryption Backdoor Demand’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/trump-domenech-interview">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> What If, Indeed </title><link href="https://www.cjr.org/public_editor/washington-post-public-editor-bezos-has-been-hands-off-what-if-that-changes.php" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w43" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/what-if-indeed" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41619</id><published> 2025-02-28T16:53:08Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T16:53:08Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Hamilton Nolan, in a 2021 piece for The Columbia Journalism Review, under the headline “Bezos Has Been Hands-Off. What if That Changes?”:</p><blockquote><p> Bezos has given the paper the resources to be bigger and better, and, by most accounts, pretty much stayed out of the newsroom&#39;s hair, besides appearing one day to present a bicycle to former editor Marty Baron. The Amazon boss has never been an overtly political man, except to the extent that he supports whatever helps him stay rich and take over the world with his robotic form of ultra-capitalism. But he is not inclined to spend his time on the phone haranguing Post editors about coverage decisions. When you are worth close to $200 billion, your time is too valuable for that.</p><p> There is no guarantee, however, that that will always be true. [...]</p><p> Discussing this question with nuance is not easy. The paper will always say that Bezos does not interfere. Bezos himself will always say that he does not interfere. Factions of the public on the right and the left will always hold that Bezos&#39;s ownership inherently corrupts the paper&#39;s coverage.</p></blockquote><p> I do give Bezos credit for taking public ownership of his assertion of control over the paper&#39;s opinion pages now. This is a major change, and he&#39;s not trying to hide it or shy away from responsibility for it.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘What If, Indeed’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/what-if-indeed">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jeff Bezos Takes Control of the Washington Post&#39;s Opinion Pages; Asserts Exclusive Focus &#39;In Support and Defense of Two Pillars: Personal Liberties and Free Markets&#39; </title><link href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w42" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/bezos-memo-post-opinion-pages" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41618</id><published> 2025-02-28T16:41:33Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T16:41:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jeff Bezos, in a memo he shared publicly on X:</p><blockquote><p> I shared this note with the Washington Post team this morning:</p><p> I&#39;m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages.</p><p> We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We&#39;ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. [...]</p><p> I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn&#39;t “hell yes,” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won&#39;t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We&#39;ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.</p></blockquote><p> He owns the paper, and the opinion pages are the traditional place for a newspaper&#39;s owner to assert their beliefs. And while Bezos was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/business/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post.html">famously hands-off</a> for the first decade of his ownership (he bought the Post from the Graham family for $250 million in 2013), this latest dictum doesn&#39;t feel out of the blue or surprising in the least. It feels like the natural culmination of his asserting control over the paper&#39;s opinion pages that started with his <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post">blockbuster decision</a> to nix the paper&#39;s endorsement of Kamala Harris just a few weeks prior to the election, and reached a breaking point <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/04/telnaes-washington-post">when the paper refused to run a cartoon</a> by Pulitzer-winning Ann Telnaes that mocked Bezos (along with other billionaires) for paying into Trump&#39;s inauguration committee racket — <a href="https://anntelnaes.substack.com/p/why-im-quitting-the-washington-post">prompting Telnaes to resign in righteous protest</a> .</p><p> How are remaining staffers at the Post taking this? Not happily. Reports Liam Reilly, media reporter at CNN:</p><blockquote><p> Current staffers echoed those sentiments. Philip Bump, who writes the “How to Read This Chart” newsletter at the Post, asked <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pbump.com/post/3lj3lzi53hk2s">Bluesky</a> “what the actual fuck” five minutes after the announcement went out. Post tech reporter Drew Harwell on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lj4o6ihfek2g">Bluesky</a> shared a summary of comments on the story generated by the Post&#39;s own AI tool that highlighted “significant discontent” from readers and “a strong sentiment of betrayal among long-time subscribers.” And, tellingly, <a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/davidmaraniss.bsky.social/post/3lj3o3ozerc2d">David Maraniss</a> , an editor at the paper, said on <a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/davidmaraniss.bsky.social/post/3lj3o3ozerc2d">Bluesky</a> that he would “never write for (the Post) again as long as (Bezos is) the owner.”</p></blockquote><p> More tellingly, the Post&#39;s own media critic, the excellent Erik Wemple, <a href="https://geneweingarten.substack.com/p/spiked">intended to write about the policy change but saw his own column spiked</a> . It&#39;s a good sign that things have gone off the rails when a publication&#39;s own media critic is disallowed from writing about their own publication.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jeff Bezos Takes Control of the Washington Post’s Opinion Pages; Asserts Exclusive Focus ‘In Support and Defense of Two Pillars: Personal Liberties and Free Markets’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/bezos-memo-post-opinion-pages">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Gene Hackman Dies at 95 </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/movies/gene-hackman-unforgiven-bonnie-clyde.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w41" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/gene-hackman-rip" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41617</id><published> 2025-02-28T15:50:48Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T16:30:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Loved this remembrance by Manohla Dargis in The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> When Clint Eastwood needed a performer who could persuasively go boot-toe to boot-toe with him in his brutal 1992 western <em>Unforgiven</em> , he needed an actor who was his towering equal onscreen. Eastwood needed a performer with strange charisma, one who could at once effortlessly draw the audience to his character and repulse it without skipping a beat. This actor didn&#39;t need the audience&#39;s love, and would never ask for it. He instead needed to go deep and dark, playing a villain of such depravity that he inspired the viewer&#39;s own blood lust. Eastwood needed a legend who could send shivers up spines. He needed Gene Hackman.</p></blockquote><p> Just an unbelievable career, in such a wide variety of films. His roles in <em>The Conversation</em> , <em>The French Connection</em> , and <em>Unforgiven</em> are atop most people&#39;s lists, and I do love each of those movies. But he was so good in everything. What a great Lex Luthor he was in 1978&#39;s <em>Superman</em> . <em>Mississippi Burning</em> , <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> , <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> , <em>The Birdcage</em> , <em>Hoosiers</em> . By chance, I just re-watched David Mamet&#39;s <em>Heist</em> a few weeks ago. Like so many of Hackman&#39;s movies, that&#39;s another one that repays multiple viewings across decades.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gene Hackman Dies at 95’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/gene-hackman-rip">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w40" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41616</id><published> 2025-02-27T04:47:35Z</published><updated> 2025-03-01T01:26:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don&#39;t want to think much about their phone.

<p>I&#39;ve spent the last six days using the iPhone 16e, and the experience has been a throwback. In many ways, the iPhone 16e both looks and feels like the modern-day progeny of the early Steve Jobs era iPhones. Early iPhones like the plastic 3G and 3GS, and the glass-back/metal-sides 4 and 4S were simpler offerings. Two colors, black and white. Single-lens inconspicuous cameras. The iPhone 16e feels like their direct descendent.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with the camera. With just a single lens on the back, the iPhone 16e camera doesn&#39;t just <em>look</em> less conspicuous compared to its dual- and triple-lens brethren, it <em>feels</em> less conspicuous. Especially for me, coming from several years of daily-driving an iPhone Pro model, the 16e feels strikingly smaller in hand and pocket because it lacks the entire “mesa” protrusion from which iPhone 16 and 16 Pro camera lenses further protrude.</p><p> Apple&#39;s tech specs for iPhone thickness don&#39;t include the camera lenses or camera mesas. Apple just measures and reports the thickness of the flat non-camera part of the phone. But those camera modules and lenses protrude quite a bit. Using a digital caliper, I measured the thickness of the three “levels” of the 16e, regular 16, and 16 Pro:</p><p><table class="table-1C94D92B-727A-4CC3-8A3B-18EA7E38C1D7" width = 350><style>

  /></a></p><p> The iPhone 16e looks like a phone with a tiny camera on the back. The iPhone 16 Pro looks like a camera that also happens to be a phone. You can really feel the difference in hand, too — not just the weight, but the balance. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-26">1</a></sup> You can feel that the 16 Pro&#39;s extra camera hardware adds extra weight. Per Apple&#39;s specs, the iPhone 16e weighs 167g; the 16 Pro 199g — a 16 percent difference. (Also take note of a clever touch: Apple&#39;s default wallpapers for each phone subtly suggest how many camera lenses they have.)</p><p> The 16e camera lens is not flush with the back of the phone, but it protrudes so little (just 1.7mm by my measurement) that it harks back to when iPhone cameras <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">first started jutting out</a> from the back of the phones at all. The 16e still wobbles when laid on a tabletop, but dramatically less than a regular iPhone 16 or especially the iPhone 16 Pro, whose camera module seems downright bulbous in comparison. But the 16e&#39;s 1.7mm camera lens protrusion is so minimal that, when put in a case, the phone <em>does</em> lay perfectly flat on a table, because the cases need no protective rim for the camera, because the 16e camera lens protrudes less than the thickness of the case. (Apple included two of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD3P4ZM/A/iphone-16e-silicone-case-white">$39 Silicone Cases</a> with my review kit, in blue and black. They&#39;re fine, and feel exactly like Apple&#39;s usual Silicone Cases.)</p><p> Because the “macro” mode on the recent regular and Pro iPhone models uses the 0.5× ultrawide camera, a secondary lens the 16e doesn&#39;t have, the 16e doesn&#39;t have a macro mode. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-macro-camera-a-big-day-for-small-things/">Starting with the iPhone 13 Pro</a> , macro mode has allowed iPhone Pros to focus on objects less than an inch away. But, because the 16e&#39;s 1× camera has a smaller sensor and smaller lens than the 1× camera on more expensive iPhone models, it&#39;s able to focus at shorter distances than those bigger and otherwise better 1× cameras. The 1× camera on an iPhone 16 Pro has a minimum focus distance of 24cm (~9.5 inches). The 1× camera on an iPhone 16e has a minimum focus distance of 12cm (~4.75 inches). Actual macro mode (on regular and Pro iPhone models) is better, but you don&#39;t need it as much when the 16e&#39;s lone camera can focus on objects at half the distance, just over 4 inches away, in its regular shooting mode.</p><p> The 16e&#39;s inconspicuous camera comes with a price, of course: image quality. You can really see the difference in low light. The 16e camera is slower (resulting in blurry images with subjects in motion) and images are noisier. The difference is especially obvious when shooting in low light with <a href="https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Process Zero in Halide</a> . It&#39;s a fine camera though, for point-and-shoot purposes. For most people who might be considering the iPhone 16e, it&#39;ll probably be the best camera they&#39;ve ever owned. And there&#39;s something to be said for the simplicity of just one lens, offering 1× and 2× fields of view. If you know what an ƒ-stop is, you probably shouldn&#39;t buy an iPhone 16e. If you don&#39;t know what an ƒ-stop is, you probably won&#39;t notice any difference in camera quality from an iPhone 16 or even 16 Pro. It&#39;s a perfect camera for anyone who just wants a decent camera.</p><h2> What&#39;s Missing: MagSafe, ProMotion, and Ultra Wideband (and, uh, the Other Ultra Wideband)</h2><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16-pro,iphone-16,iphone-16e">Peruse Apple&#39;s comparison page</a> , comparing the 16e to the 16 Pro and regular 16, and you&#39;ll spot dozens of small differences. But the one omission that grabbed the most attention (and generated the most “WTF Apple?” reactions) is MagSafe. I own a bunch of MagSafe peripherals, and personally would never want to buy an iPhone without it. I have <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-carbide">a dock</a> at my desk (great with <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-standby-iph878d77632/ios">StandBy mode</a> ), a <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger">charger at my nightstand</a> , and convenient doodads like <a href="https://www.moft.us/products/case-stand-wallet-snap-set?variant=39411246989399">this magnetic folding stand</a> . One week into using the 16e as my main phone, and I still miss MagSafe as much as I did the first night.</p><p> But according to Apple representatives, most people in the 16e&#39;s target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable. They tend not to use inductive charging at all, and when they do, they might not care that the 16e is stuck with a pokey 7.5W Qi charging speed, when recent more expensive iPhones charge via MagSafe at 15W or even 25W. For me, it&#39;s not the high charging speed I miss most; it&#39;s the snapping into place. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-26">2</a></sup> I think Apple knows the 16e&#39;s intended audience better than I do. Daring Fireball readers aren&#39;t in the 16e demographic; it&#39;s the friends and family members of DF readers who are.</p><p> What features do typical low-end iPhone buyers care about? They want a phone that looks good, with a good display, a decent camera, and long battery life. Do they care that the 16e only supports Wi-Fi 6, not 7? No, because they have zero idea what Wi-Fi version numbers even mean. They just think Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi. Do they care about superspeed mmWave 5G networking from Verizon (aka “ultra wideband”)? No. They just want their cellular connection to be fast and strong. (My review unit from Apple came with a temporary eSIM on AT&amp;T. Cellular connections were fast and strong all week. The only place where I noticed a weak signal was in a deeply suburban / borderline rural area while visiting family over the weekend; my wife&#39;s iPhone 15 Pro Max lost its signal on Verizon at the same location. I have zero complaints about Apple&#39;s C1 modem.)</p><p> The iPhone 16e also omits <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109021">the <em>other</em> “ultra wideband”</a> , the chip Apple uses for precise location detection — like tracking an AirPod to within a foot. Precision finding is super cool, and when you&#39;re truly bedeviled by a lost item like a keychain, remarkably helpful. Ultra wideband has been included on all new iPhones other than the SE (and now 16e) since the iPhones 11 in 2019. From a nerd&#39;s perspective, it really does seem like a curious omission from the 16e five years later. But how many people in your extended family know what “ultra wideband precision finding” is?</p><p> To date, only Apple&#39;s iPhone Pro models have supported ProMotion — Apple&#39;s marketing name for a display that features adaptive refresh rates that go up to 120 Hz and down to 1 Hz for the “Always On” display mode. Given that the regular iPhone 16 (and 16 Plus) don&#39;t support ProMotion, there was zero chance the 16e would. There are mid-range Android phones with high-refresh-rate displays, but (a) I don&#39;t think they&#39;re <em>better</em> displays, all things considered, and (b) they&#39;re mid-range Android phones. It&#39;s like bragging about the refresh rate on the dashboard display in a Kia Sorento. The 16e display also sports a throwback notch in lieu of the fancier, more playful, and at times cleverly useful, dynamic island.</p><p> The iPhone 16e targets the “I only care about the basics” iPhone buyer: the screen looks good, the camera is good but simple, the battery lasts a long time (the difference should be quite striking for anyone upgrading from a four- or five-year-old iPhone), it runs all their existing apps, and it charges fast when plugged into a USB cable. Those are the basics, and the basics are all that casual users care about. That it&#39;s lighter in weight and physically smaller thanks to its minimally protruding single camera lens is gravy.</p><h2>定价</h2><p>The only aspect of the 16e garnering more discussion than its omission of MagSafe is its starting price of $600 for a 128 GB base model. “It should cost $100 less” say some people, who tend to be the same people who <em>also</em> strongly believe it should include MagSafe and a ProMotion display. Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s current iPhone lineup, plus the discontinued (but <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022.html?q=iphone%20se">still</a> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-se-3rd-generation-64gb-unlocked-black/6507470.p?skuId=6507470">available</a> from <a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/prepaid-phones/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022-64gb-midnight">some</a> carriers) 3rd-generation SE: </p><table class="table-7940E2A4-0011-4258-A4DA-D506F80A4F67" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The new 16e starting at $600 makes more sense than the old SE starting at just $430. $600 is clearly the next logical “rung” under the year-old iPhone 15&#39;s $700 starting price. Complaining that Apple no longer makes a phone that&#39;s priced in the $400-500 range is like complaining that BMW no longer makes any cars that cost less than $40,000. They&#39;re Apple. It&#39;s an iPhone. Of course it costs more than a no-name Android phone, or the 27th model down the ladder in Samsung&#39;s sprawling product lineup. Anyone who wants to spend less than $600 for an iPhone can buy one from the flourishing pre-owned/refurbished market — just like buying a BMW for under $40,000.</p><p> The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don&#39;t want to think much about their phone. But they <em>do</em> want an iPhone, not just any “whatever” phone. A just plain iPhone, with a good screen, good enough (and simple) camera, and great battery life. I think Apple nailed that with the iPhone 16e.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-26"><p> There&#39;s a decided <em>feel</em> difference with the side rails of the 16e too.

<p>Joseph Menn, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The US Justice Department told Congress in November there were no major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies seek data from each other&#39;s communication companies.</p><p> But at that time, officials knew British authorities were preparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users&#39; encrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department matters. [...]</p><p> The department said it reminded its British counterpart of the CLOUD Act&#39;s “requirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not create any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data.” The report did not mention the looming order, and said any demands for reduced security would come under Britain&#39;s Investigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the CLOUD Act.</p><p> On Wednesday, Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, faulted the November certification, saying “it splits the finest of hairs” by suggesting that the CLOUD Act didn&#39;t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit on the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of Congress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating the Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple&#39;s encryption.</p><p> Two of the people familiar with the certification process said the FBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United States and would have been in a stronger legal position to win that if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for another government.</p></blockquote><p> Just utterly disgraceful behavior from the Biden administration — choosing to look the other way at a clear violation of the CLOUD Act to help their purported buddies in the UK, at the direct expense of a US company&#39;s autonomy and US citizens&#39; privacy. I don&#39;t see how this dissembling can be defended.

<p>Zac Hall, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> According to a letter seen by 9to5Mac, the Trump Administration is investigating whether the UK may have broken a bilateral agreement when secretly demanding that Apple build a global backdoor into iCloud.</p><p> Trump&#39;s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote in a letter responding to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona that she was not made aware of the UK&#39;s secret demand by her UK counterparts. However, she suggested, the UK government may have broken a bilateral privacy and surveillance agreement in making the demand.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2025/02/DNI-Wyden-Biggs-Response-1.pdf">Gabbard&#39;s letter is available here</a> (and I&#39;m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/DNI-Wyden-Biggs-Response-1.pdf">hosting a copy</a> ). From her letter:</p><blockquote><p> Thank you for your letter dated 13 February 2025 concerning reported actions by the United Kingdom toward Apple that could undermine Americans&#39; privacy and civil liberties at risk. I am aware of the press reporting that the UK Home Secretary served Apple with a secret order directing the company to create a “back door” capability in its iCloud encryption to facilitate UK government access to any Apple iCloud users&#39; uploaded data anywhere in the world. I share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a “backdoor” that would allow access to Americans personal encrypted data. This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans&#39; privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.</p><p> I was not made aware of this reported order, either by the United Kingdom government or Apple, prior to it being reported in the media. I have requested my counterparts at CIA, DIA, DHS, FBI and NSA to provide insights regarding the publicly reported actions, and will subsequently engage with UK government officials. The UK&#39;s Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, also known as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, which I understand would be at issue, allows the UK to issue a “gag order,” which would prevent Apple or any company from voicing their concerns with myself, or the public. [...]</p><p> My lawyers are working to provide a legal opinion on the implications of the reported UK demands against Apple on the bilateral Cloud Act agreement. Upon initial review of the US and UK bilateral CLOUD Act Agreement, the United Kingdom may not issue demands for data of US citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents (“US persons”), nor is it authorized to demand the data of persons located inside the United States. The same is true for the United States — it may not use the CLOUD Act agreement to demand data of any person located in the United Kingdom.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m so pleased by Gabbard&#39;s response here, including making it public, that I&#39;m gladly willing to overlook her “back door”/”backdoor” and “UK”/”UK” inconsistencies. ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF style</a> is now to close it up: <em>backdoor</em> .)</p><p> Short of the UK backing down and retracting its secret demand for an iCloud backdoor from Apple, this is the best that Apple and privacy advocates could hope for. The gag-order aspect of the UK&#39;s Investigatory Powers Act prevented Apple from even fighting it in court. But a US ruling that would hold it illegal for Apple to comply would put Apple in an impossible situation, where they can&#39;t comply with a UK legal demand without violating the law of the home country. That would actually give Apple the ground to fight this in the UK.</p><p> It is not coincidental that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5305750/keir-starmer-trump-white-house">UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit the White House tomorrow</a> .

<p>I referenced Downie twice earlier today — once in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business">my item linking to Charlie Monroe</a> (developer of Downie) writing about the indie app business, and earlier <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/ive-desert-island-discs">in my post about using Downie to download the MP3</a> from Jony Ive&#39;s interview on the BBC&#39;s Desert Island Discs.</p><p> I somehow hadn&#39;t heard of (or more likely, just hadn&#39;t noticed) Downie until a few weeks ago, when I first came across <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/">Monroe&#39;s blog post</a> , <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/01/31/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/">via Michael Tsai</a> . Here&#39;s the pitch for Downie, from its website:</p><blockquote><p> Ever wished you could save a video from the Internet? Search no more, Downie is what you&#39;re looking for. Easily download videos from thousands of different sites.</p></blockquote><p>就是这样。 You give it a web page URL, and Downie will download any video (or audio) files embedded on the page. Downie offers all sorts of convenience features, like browser extensions, post-processing, and more. But the main interface is super obvious and easy.</p><p> For years, I&#39;ve used the open source <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> command-line tool for this task (and before yt-dlp, its predecessor, youtube-dl). When I saw Downie, I thought to myself, “ <em>That looks cool, but I don&#39;t really download that many video or audio files to justify paying for a commercial app.</em> ” But then I slapped myself (figuratively) and I realized I should at least <em>try</em> it.我很高兴自己做到了。 It&#39;s like using Transmit instead of the command-line tools for secure FTP connections. It&#39;s cool that the Mac has a Unix terminal interface and support for zillions of free and open source utilities, but the point of using a Mac is to use great Mac apps. And Downie is a great Mac app.</p><p> What I&#39;ve found over the last month isn&#39;t just that I enjoy using Downie far more than invoking yt-dlp, but that I use Downie more often than I used yt-dlp, because it&#39;s so much easier and more reliable. For example, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design">when I wrote about Fox Sports&#39;s new scorebug</a> that debuted in the Super Bowl, I used Downie to download local 4K copies of this month&#39;s Super Bowl 59, along with Super Bowl 57 from two years ago, to compare Fox&#39;s new scorebug with their previous one.

<p>Charlie Monroe, developer of excellent apps such as <a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie">Downie</a> and <a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute">Permute</a> :</p><blockquote><p> But also don&#39;t do this alone. I work 365 days a year. Last year, I worked 366 days (2024 was leap year). I&#39;m not saying that I work 8 hours each day, but even during weekends, holidays, vacation, I need to tend to support emails in the morning for an hour or so and then once more in the afternoon or evening. I cannot just take off and leave for a few days without seeing the consequences and going insane when I get back. I currently receive about 100 reports from my apps each day. Some are about license code issues, some are crash reports, some are Permute conversion issues, some are Downie download issues, but it all adds up to the average of the 100 reports a day.</p><p> If I were to leave for a vacation for 10 days… You do the math what would I be getting back to. Plus your users don&#39;t want to wait for 10 days. Even 5 days. There are users who are unwilling to wait an hour and just don&#39;t realize that you cannot be at the computer 24-hours a day and that you&#39;re perhaps in a different time zone and sleeping. The unfortunate thing about this is that going through the support emails in my case is something that takes about 2-3 hours a day — which is not enough to hire someone and train them. Not to mention that most of the reports actually need some technical knowledge. So unless I would hire another developer, in the end, the really administrative stuff that someone could do instead of me is a 30-minute-a-day job.</p></blockquote><p> I wouldn&#39;t recommend never taking a complete break for anyone, but there are some businesses where <em>someone</em> needs to spend an hour-plus on certain tasks each day. If you&#39;re a one-person operation, that person is you, even while on vacation. No one gets into indie development because they look forward to doing support, either. It&#39;s the designing, programming, crafting, and refining of the apps that drives them. But it&#39;s like being a musician or comedian in some ways. For those endeavors, the grind is traveling from one city to another for gigs. Or like running a restaurant, as dramatized on <em>The Bear</em> — prep work, cleaning, procurement, reservations, food allergies, more cleaning.它永远不会停止。 For indie developers, the grind is support. (Small restaurants typically close for a day or two each week; technical support email addresses don&#39;t.) There&#39;s just always a lot of menial work involved with being a professional artist. But that&#39;s also why so many indie developers — like, seemingly, Monroe — find the endeavor worthwhile. Because artistic work is deeply fulfilling.</p><p> A while back — around 20 years ago, at the height of the “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol">Delicious</a> ” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/27/siracusa-delicous-library">renaissance</a> in indie development for Mac OS X — there was a developer who burst onto the scene with a deservedly very popular app. It was gorgeous and fast. It had a lot fewer features than other apps in its somewhat-crowded category, but that was also part of the app&#39;s appeal. It was like a sporty little roadster in a category full of practical sedans and trucks. He eventually came out with a second app, and it too was popular. His apps were sort of like Panic&#39;s, aesthetically, I&#39;d say. They not only looked cool, they were well-designed from a usability perspective too. This developer, so I&#39;ve been told, spent almost no time at all on tech support from customers. How was this possible, a friend of mine asked him. Easy, this developer said. When the inbox for support emails looked full, he&#39;d do a Select All, then Delete. Inbox zero.</p><p> This story has always made me laugh. It&#39;s hilarious, in a way. But ultimately it was a sign that he just wasn&#39;t cut out for the indie app business. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that his apps went dormant around 2010, and I haven&#39;t heard of him or from him in like 15 years. He was super talented so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he&#39;s doing great work in some other business, perhaps inside a much bigger company, where developers and designers are isolated from customers, rather than enmeshed with them like indies inherently are.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Charlie Monroe: ‘A Few Words About Indie App Business’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> xAI&#39;s Grok-3 Jumps to the Top of AI Leaderboards </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/617780/grok-3-elon-musk-ai-race-chatgpt" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/grok-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41611</id><published> 2025-02-26T19:32:29Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T23:09:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alex Heath, writing for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/598846/deepseek-big-tech-ai-industry-nvidia-impac">everyone freaked out</a> about DeepSeek, Elon Musk&#39;s Grok-3 has again shaken up the fast-moving AI race. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614218/elon-musk-xai-big-brain-reasoning-grok-3">The new model</a> is ending the week at the top of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">Chatbot Arena leaderboard</a> , while the Grok iOS app is at the top of the App Store, just above ChatGPT. Even as Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/elon-musk/617090/elon-musk-cpac-2025-transcript">appears to be crashing out</a> from his newfound political power, his xAI team has managed to deploy a leading foundational model in record time. [...]</p><p> While its Deep Research reports are nowhere near as in depth as OpenAI&#39;s, Grok-3&#39;s “thinking” capabilities appear to be roughly on par with o1, according to Andrej Karpathy, <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1891720635363254772">who noted</a> in his deep dive comparison that “this timescale to state of the art territory is unprecedented.”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://x.com/benedictevans/status/1358760338724974594">Benedict Evans, back in 2021, observed</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Elon Musk is a bullshitter who delivers. This breaks a lot of people&#39;s pattern-matching, in both directions.</p></blockquote><p> This summation of Musk is more apt, and more useful, today than it was four years ago. The Boring Company is <a href="https://defector.com/what-the-boring-company-does">seemingly a complete fraud</a> , and he&#39;s been making <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/elon-musk-promises-full-self-driving-next-year-for-th-1848432496/">unfulfilled promises about Tesla “full self-driving”</a> for over a decade. But Tesla Motors has done more to make electric cars mainstream than all other automakers combined. <a href="https://x.com/jasonfried/status/1873056615345340566">Starlink delivers</a> extraordinary satellite Internet service, with no real competitors. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-catches-returning-rocket-in-mid-air-turning-a-fanciful-idea-into-reality/">SpaceX has rejuvenated the rocket industry</a> . xAI seems to fall on the “actually delivers” side.</p><p> Twitter/X seems to fall squarely in the middle. It&#39;s a mess in many ways, and seems not one iota closer to Musk&#39;s promised vision of an “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">everything app</a> ”, but under Musk&#39;s ownership it has been transformed, and while it isn&#39;t more popular than it used to be, it also isn&#39;t less (or much less) popular. It&#39;s just a different somewhat scummier audience and vibe.</p><p> My betting money says the whole DOGE thing is very much on the bullshit side, but Musk&#39;s overall track record spans the gamut from outright scams to extraordinary historic accomplishments. He&#39;s such a prolific and shameless bullshitter that I wouldn&#39;t take Musk at his word about anything, even what he had for lunch. But I&#39;d be loath to bet against him on an engineering endeavor.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘xAI’s Grok-3 Jumps to the Top of AI Leaderboards’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/grok-3">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iOS Voice Dictation Bug (?)

<p>Chris Welch, writing at The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Apple has acknowledged a peculiar bug with the iPhone&#39;s dictation feature that briefly displays “Trump” when someone says the word “racist.” The Verge has been unable to reproduce the issue, but it picked up attention on Tuesday after a video demonstrating the strange substitution <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user9586420191789/video/7472830639327366446">went viral on TikTok</a> and other social media.</p><p> The company provided a statement to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/technology/iphone-dictation-trump-racist.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/apple-iphones-voice-to-text-feature-periodically-shows-trump-when-user-says-racist">Fox News</a> confirming the bug. “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers dictation, and we are rolling out a fix as soon as possible,” an unnamed spokesperson said, according to Fox News.</p></blockquote><p> From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/technology/iphone-dictation-trump-racist.html">the Times story</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The issue appeared to begin after an update to Apple&#39;s servers, said John Burkey, the founder of Wonderrush.ai, an artificial intelligence start-up, and a former member of Apple&#39;s Siri team who is still in regular contact with the team.</p><p> But he said that it was unlikely that the data that Apple has collected for its artificial intelligence offerings was causing the problem, and the word correcting itself was likely an indication that the issue was not just technical. Instead, he said, there was probably software code somewhere on Apple&#39;s systems that caused iPhones to write the word “Trump” when someone said “racist.”</p><p> “This smells like a serious prank,” Mr. Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?”</p></blockquote><p> Paul Kafasis (my guest on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/02/24/ep-417">the latest episode</a> of The Talk Show) <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/2025/02/26/theyre-certainly-synonyms/">captured a video of the glitch in action</a> . I guess it could be a protest prank from a rogue employee, but I suspect it&#39;s just a machine learning glitch — maybe caused by the fact that Trump&#39;s name gets mentioned alongside “racist” so often? It&#39;s definitely a little weird, but all sorts of things about Siri are a little weird.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iOS Voice Dictation Bug (?)

<p>Desert Island Discs is a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/59YrnYM0Tw8J7WJ0MGKVfh7/the-history-of-desert-island-discs">remarkably long-running</a> BBC Radio interview program now hosted (or <em>presented</em> , if you will) by Lauren Laverne. The gimmick is that guests are asked to name eight songs, a book, and a “luxury item” they&#39;d take with them if stranded on a desert island, and those picks — including playing the songs — are sprinkled throughout the interview. This week&#39;s guest is Jony Ive, and it&#39;s one of the best interviews with him I&#39;ve ever encountered. Incredibly thoughtful and inspiring, and Laverne covers a lot of ground without ever seeming the least bit hurried.</p><p> A few highlights, from Ive:</p><blockquote><p> I think that one of the struggles I have, though, is in some ways, I think ironically, I struggle with being present in the now because I spend so much of my life in my head in the future. The way I try to understand the future is I&#39;m obsessed with the past. And so the bit that often gets missed out is right now.</p></blockquote><p>我知道那种感觉。</p><p> Regarding his early years at Apple, before the reunification with NeXT and the return of Steve Jobs, Ive spoke about the company&#39;s severe financial troubles skewing how it thought about products:</p><blockquote><p> I think when you struggle, then a goal can become just commercial issues. I understand — I mean, if you&#39;re losing lots of money, you&#39;d like to stop losing lots of money. The problem there is it means you focus on money, and you&#39;re normally losing money because the products aren&#39;t right. And from &#39;92 to &#39;97, it was a very, very difficult season. One that I am so grateful for — but I still get the shivers sometimes.</p></blockquote><p> The telling word Ive used in that passage is “right”. He could have said the problem was that Apple&#39;s mid-&#39;90s products weren&#39;t “good”, but he didn&#39;t. Judging them as good or bad isn&#39;t the correct framework. It&#39;s that they weren&#39;t <em>right</em> . There&#39;s an inherent subjectiveness to rightness. A <em>je ne sais quoi</em> . The original iMac that started Ive&#39;s long and remarkably fruitful collaboration with Steve Jobs wasn&#39;t a hit because it was good, so much as because it was so obviously <em>right</em> .</p><p> (The BBC&#39;s <a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/b006qnmr.rss">podcast feed for Desert Island Discs</a> seems to run about a month behind the website, alas. I nabbed the MP3 from the BBC&#39;s web page (using <a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/">Downie</a> ) and <a href="https://overcast.fm/uploads">uploaded the file manually to Overcast</a> .

<p>Michael Liedtke, reporting for the AP:</p><blockquote><p> Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump&#39;s push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.</p><p> The <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2025/Proxy_Statement_2025.pdf">proposal</a> drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — <a href="https://nationalcenter.org/about/">a self-described conservative think tank</a> — urged Apple to follow <a href="https://apnews.com/article/companies-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-lawsuits-753f027bb73a1035a919482427553ea3">a litany of high-profile companies</a> that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration&#39;s crosshairs.</p><p> After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it. In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes against the measure.</p></blockquote><p> President Trump, at 8am this morning, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114070315739588346">on his own very popular social network</a> :</p><blockquote><p> APPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM. DEI WAS A HOAX THAT HAS BEEN VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. DEI IS GONE!!!</p></blockquote><p> Needless to say, the National Center for Public Policy Research is a bunch of ding-dongs, and Trump has no idea, at all, what <a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/">Apple&#39;s actual policies and goals are for diversity</a> — he just knows he wants them gone. (And I love the photo MacRumors&#39;s Joe Rossignol chose <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/trump-on-apple-diversity-policies/">for his report on this story</a> .)</p><p> There does exist a formal world of DEI, right down to using that very acronym. Think of it as <em>DEI™</em> . Some <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/how-is-dei-going-at-the-university-of-michigan/">universities seem overrun with it</a> , despite results that <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/does-dei-even-work/">strongly suggest it doesn&#39;t work</a> and <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/university-dei-statements-are-a-demeaning-charade/">some clearly objectionable dogmatic requirements</a> . But there are obvious reasons any company (or university, or organization) ought to be concerned about diversity and inclusion, in the plain sense of those words. Not just ethical “ <em>the way things ought to be</em> ” reasons, but <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">empirical studies have shown</a> that diverse organizations are more successful.</p><p> It&#39;s a spectrum. A lot of US universities are at the far left of that spectrum. The Trump administration and its proponents are, clearly, at the far right of that spectrum, where they&#39;re seeking now to pressure companies into not even concerning themselves with “diversity” in the plainest sense of the word, and are scrubbing from government agencies words like “woman” and “disabled”. I&#39;m being overly simplistic by presenting the left/right divide as unidimensional here. Trump, for example, has ushered in a very different “right” than that of, say, the Bush-Cheney era 20 years ago. But the DEI™ “left” is a very different left than <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/cancel-culture-illiberalism-dead/681031/">the truly liberal free-speech left</a> . Liberals object to DEI&#39;s rigidity, dogma, and performative nature; Trump and his cohorts object to actual human diversity and inclusiveness.</p><p> Some big corporations, in recent years, veered pretty far to the extreme on “DEI initiatives”, and are using the current political moment <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lowes-dei-harley-davidson-john-deere-tractor-supply/">to course correct back toward</a> the (to me, sensible) center. But this course correction started long before Trump&#39;s re-election. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html">a CNBC story from December 2023</a> on Google and Meta scaling back formal DEI programs.</p><p> Apple, from my observations, has long charted its own consistent course on such matters, right down to calling their policies “Inclusion &amp; Diversity” rather than the name-brand “DEI”. Apple didn&#39;t lunge to the left at the height of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, because they didn&#39;t need to. And so they have no need to course correct now. Apple shareholders seemingly agree.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Shareholders Resoundingly Reject Proposal to Ditch the Company’s ‘Inclusion and Diversity’ Policies; Trump Responds With His Usual Equanimity’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/apple-shareholders-reject-proposl-to-ditch-diversity-policies">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Yours Truly With Rene Ritchie Talking About the iPhone 16e</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5OdiEzJNgk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/25/rene-ritchie-iphone-16e" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41607</id><published> 2025-02-25T22:55:12Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T22:55:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mike Allen, writing for Axios, under the headline “Trump Manufacturing Win: Apple to Spend $500 Billion in US, Hire 20,000”:</p><blockquote><p> Trump met with Cook on Thursday in the Oval Office. Then Trump got so excited that he revealed the plans prematurely, saying on-camera while meeting with governors that Cook is “investing hundreds of billions of dollars. I hope he&#39;s announced it — I hope I didn&#39;t announce it, but what the hell? All I do is tell the truth — that&#39;s what he told me. Now he has to do it, right?”</p><p> “He is investing hundreds of billions of dollars and others, too,” Trump continued. “We will have a lot of chipmakers coming in, a lot of automakers coming in. They stopped two plants in Mexico that were ... starting construction. They just stopped them — they&#39;re going to build them here instead, because they don&#39;t want to pay the tariffs. Tariffs are amazing.”</p></blockquote><p> Apple and Tim Cook, I&#39;m sure, are pleased as pie to have today&#39;s announcement portrayed this way, as a “Trump manufacturing win”, despite the fact that it&#39;s seemingly exactly in line with the trajectory Apple&#39;s been on for US job creation since 2018, including a nearly identical announcement <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">in 2021</a> (that they largely, but <a href="https://abc11.com/post/apple-nc-east-coast-hub-on-hold-research-triangle-park-3-years-later-1-billion-project/14997218/">not entirely</a> , followed through on).</p><p> The Mexico angle rings weird to my ears, though. Bloomberg picked up on that too, running a headline over the weekend that read “ <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tim-cook-meeting-trump-220006653.html">Trump Says Cook Shifting Apple Manufacturing From Mexico to US</a> ”.</p><p> The last thing I remember Apple having assembled in Mexico were a small number of late model Apple Extended Keyboard II&#39;s in 1995 (which were <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">inferior to their American-made models</a> , like the one I&#39;m using to write this). It&#39;s quite possible I&#39;m overlooking some Mexican-made Apple products in the intervening decades, but if there are any, they&#39;re not recent. So I suspect Tim Cook, in his meeting with Trump last week, sold him a bill of goods, and more or less convinced Trump that Apple <em>had</em> been planning to commission some new plants in Mexico (a country so loathsome <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco">Trump confiscated their gulf</a> ) but, thanks to President Trump&#39;s inspiring leadership, Apple would instead be building those plants right here in the US, in the big old red state of Texas — when in fact all of this is pretty much exactly what Apple had been planning to do all along.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Mission Accomplished: Trump Likes Apple’s Plan, Especially the Part About Mexico That I Don’t Think Was Real’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/mission-accomplished">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Announces Plan to Spend More Than $500 Billion in the US Over the Next Four Years (Which Is Probably Exactly What They&#39;ve Been Planning to Do) </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41603</id><published> 2025-02-24T20:23:36Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T01:43:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced its largest-ever spend commitment, with plans to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years.</p></blockquote><p> The context of making a big deal over this announcement, of course, is that Apple is seeking exemptions from the Trump administration&#39;s tariffs. $500 billion is a lot of money, even for Apple, and 20,000 new jobs over the next four years is a lot of jobs, especially at a time when many big tech companies are laying off, not hiring. (The federal government is trying to lay off a lot of employees too, if you haven&#39;t heard.) But <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-earmarks-500-billion-for-u-s-expansion-19ca11a0">as the WSJ notes in their story on this announcement</a> , those 20,000 new jobs are a continuation of their existing hiring growth: “The company, which had 164,000 full-time equivalent employees as of September, has added an average of 5,400 annually over the past five years.”</p><p> Apple announced a similar plan four years ago — $430 billion and 20,000 jobs. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">In the announcement of that 2021 plan, Apple said</a> , “Over the past three years, Apple&#39;s contributions in the US have significantly outpaced the company&#39;s original five-year goal of $350 billion set in 2018.”</p><p> So I don&#39;t think this announcement is bullshit, at all. But I also don&#39;t think <em>what</em> Apple has announced today is much, if any, different from what they&#39;d be doing if Kamala Harris had gotten 1–2 percent more of the vote in a handful of states in November. The difference is that everyone is looking for quid pro quo with President Transactional back in office.</p><p> Apple again:</p><blockquote><p> As part of its new US investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.</p><p> Previously manufactured outside the US, the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&amp;D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.</p></blockquote><p> Kind of interesting that the big manufacturing news is a product that Apple doesn&#39;t even sell, but produces only for its own use. I don&#39;t <em>think</em> this is a hint that they might begin selling servers ( <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/05/apple-discontinues-xserve-only-available-until-january-31st/">again</a> ), but who knows? I also wonder whether there&#39;s a corporate-espionage security angle to assembling these servers here, rather than in China.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces Plan to Spend More Than $500 Billion in the U.S. Over the Next Four Years (Which Is Probably Exactly What They’ve Been Planning to Do)’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> HP Added a 15-Minute Waiting Time for Telephone Support Calls </title><link href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/20/hp_deliberately_adds_15_minutes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41602</id><published> 2025-02-24T17:59:57Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T18:49:42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Paul Kunert, reporting for The Register last week:</p><blockquote><p> HP Inc is trying to force consumer PC and print customers to use online and other digital support channels by setting a minimum 15-minute wait time for anyone that phones the call center to get answers to troublesome queries. The wait time was added on Tuesday, February 18, according to internal communications seen by The Register, and impacts retail patrons in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, though we anticipate more countries could be added.</p><p> On the fifth, tenth, and thirteenth minute, the recorded message will tell HP customers it is “experiencing longer waiting times and we apologize for the inconvenience,” and again remind them they may switch to alternatives.</p></blockquote><p> Three days later, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/21/hp_ditches_15_minute_wait_time_call_centers/">HP reversed the new policy</a> , issuing this bullshit statement:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re always looking for ways to improve our customer service experience. This support offering was intended to provide more digital options with the goal of reducing time to resolve inquiries.</p><p> We have found that many of our customers were not aware of the digital support options we provide. Based on initial feedback, we know the importance of speaking to live customer service agents in a timely fashion is paramount. As a result, we will continue to prioritize timely access to live phone support to ensure we are delivering an exceptional customer experience.</p></blockquote><p> There&#39;s spin, and then there&#39;s just bald-faced lying. This clearly had nothing to do with improving customer support and was simply about cost. HP so wanted to discourage customers from using phone support to reach a real person for help that they instituted a 15-minute penalty timeout to discourage people from waiting.</p><p> There&#39;s some kind of joke to be made here about this literally inhumane approach to customer support being unveiled in the same week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane">HP announced its acquisition of Humane</a> — the company that turned its $1,000 AI Pins into bricks.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘HP Added a 15-Minute Waiting Time for Telephone Support Calls’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sigma BF</title><link href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/bf/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41601</id><published> 2025-02-24T17:46:46Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T17:46:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Absolutely beautiful new camera from Sigma. Full-size sensor, interchangeable lens system, but it&#39;s the camera design that jumps out:</p><blockquote><p> The Sigma BF represents a new, more intuitive way to use a camera. It is streamlined to make the act of photography as effortless as possible. We have replaced the shooting mode dial — itself a holdover from the days of film photography — with direct access to the five elements that decide the photograph. Shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode are all immediately available at the touch of a finger. The new Status Monitor displays the currently active setting, so the screen provides an unobstructed view of the subject.</p><p> The BF&#39;s high-resolution screen provides a distraction-free view of all necessary information — and nothing more. With one simple setting, it shows only the live view image, with the five key elements — shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode — displayed when you are ready to press the shutter button. All other options and settings are accessed via just three simple menu screens.</p></blockquote><p> This camera immediately struck lust in my heart. So many fewer dials and buttons, it&#39;s striking. They even got rid of storage cards — 230 GB of internal storage instead. $2000 (sans any lenses).</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Sigma BF’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Linus Sebastian&#39;s Thoughts After Switching to an iPhone for 30 Days </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41600</id><published> 2025-02-23T23:14:25Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T19:04:13Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I&#39;ve been meaning, since it came out in December, to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">this video from Linus Sebastian</a> of “Linus Tech Tips” fame, and with the iPhone 16e dropping this week, now seems like a good time. It&#39;s a common genre that dates back decades before YouTube was even a thing: longtime user of platform X switches to rival platform Y for a few weeks, and then explains what they liked, what they didn&#39;t, what confused them, etc. This sort of thing always raises hackles because there&#39;s a natural human tendency to get tribal — if not downright religious — about one&#39;s platforms of choice. And Sebastian&#39;s intro — playing to YouTube&#39;s algorithm — frames it in a way that makes it seem like his overall take on iOS is going to be inflammatory. Right in the first 30 seconds of the 20-minute video, he says:</p><blockquote><p> Just a few days into my iOS challenge I started to look a little differently at the Apple users in my life. They describe Apple products with marketing slogans like “it just works” as though they actually believe them, and it made me wonder, does Apple have one version of their products for the True Believers and then a different one for the scrubs like me? Because my time with the iPhone 16 Plus has been absolutely riddled with unintuitive design choices, unnecessarily limited functionality, and some of the weirdest bugs that I have encountered on a supposedly finished product in years.</p></blockquote><p> The first time I watched the video, my finger started hovering to the close-tab button at this point. But that provocative opening isn&#39;t really representative of Sebastian&#39;s actual observations and complaints at all. It&#39;s just the YouTube/social-media style.我？ I would start an essay, on, say, the things that bug me the most about Android, in the least inflammatory way possible, to open people&#39;s minds and get as many Android proponents as possible to relax, and listen to my arguments. And then I&#39;d try to make my case, building to a crescendo where I deliver my perhaps inflammatory conclusions only at the very end. YouTube works the reverse way — you start out in provocative fashion to raise hackles, because outrage drives engagement, but then sort of work your way back toward reasonableness.</p><p> Sebastian is a long-time Android user, but he&#39;s not really a phone guy at all. He doesn&#39;t review phones, typically. His own personal Android phone is several years old. His interest and renown is entirely in the field of PCs. So his video isn&#39;t really “ <em>Android power user reviews iOS</em> ”, but more like “ <em>PC power user who is also an Android user tries an iPhone for a month</em> ”.</p><p> I like these sort of videos because I&#39;m all-in on iOS at this point. I&#39;ve kept an Android phone at my desk since the Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One">Nexus One</a> in 2010, but the one still at my desk is a five-year-old Pixel 4. I feel more out of touch with the state-of-the-art on Android than ever. So a video like this, from the perspective of someone who is himself way out of date with the state-of-the-art on the iPhone side of the fence, is really interesting.</p><p> Sebastian winds up making a bunch of astute critiques of iOS and the iPhone experience. None of them were new to me, and none of them really left me with any sense of missing out by not being part of Team Android. But most of his complaints are completely legit — and a lot of them are things Apple should address. He complains repeatedly about iOS&#39;s animated transitions making everything feel slow. That&#39;s 100 percent true. As an everyday iPhone user I&#39;m just completely used to that. But those animations really do make iPhones feel slower than they are. In terms of tech specs iPhones are literally the fastest phones on the planet. Apple&#39;s A-series silicon is, and always has been, years ahead of the best silicon money can buy in an Android handset. But a lot of aspects of iOS <em>feel</em> slower than Android because of animated transitions which iOS (nor iPadOS) offers no option to speed up.它应该。 And the Accessibility setting to completely turn off animations doesn&#39;t solve the problem; what I want, and I think what Sebastian wants, is <em>faster</em> animations. (Sebastian also justifiably complains about the fact that so many useful iOS settings are buried under Accessibility. Many of the settings in Accessibility are related to accessibility, but a lot of them would be better found in an “Advanced” section of Settings that doesn&#39;t exist.)</p><p> Sebastian also correctly skewers iOS for its confusing audio volume settings; Android definitely wins here. Rearranging home screen icons sucks on iOS. CarPlay has annoying bugs. His fresh eyes were annoyed by something mine just accept: that Apple&#39;s first-party apps tend to put their preference settings in the Settings app, but third-party apps tend to keep them in-app. (But now Apple is starting to do that too, with new apps like Sports.)</p><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">Give the video a watch</a> . Again, it didn&#39;t leave me with an iota of envy for life on the Android side of the fence, but it reminded me about a bunch of things on iOS that don&#39;t make sense, and seemingly are the way they are only because that&#39;s how they always have been.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Linus Sebastian’s Thoughts After Switching to an iPhone for 30 Days’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Going Deep on &#39;Deep&#39; </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/18/deep-peak-deep-deepseek-ai-tech-chatgpt-naming/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/22/going-deep-on-deep" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41599</id><published> 2025-02-22T15:42:55Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T19:05:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>File this one under “precise words matter”.

<p>Jim Rea:</p><blockquote><p> Forty years ago today the doors opened for the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/Photos-of-the-first-Macworld-in-1985-and-why-15880682.php">very first Macworld Expo</a> in the Brooks Hall basement in San Francisco. For most of you this event probably seems like ancient history, somewhere back in the mists of time. But for me this was a very real and exciting event that I participated in as an exhibitor, the start of my amazing journey with the Mac community, a journey that continues on today.</p><p> As I recall there were two or three dozen software booths that first year. Some of the software on display included <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/multiplan-10">Multiplan</a> (Microsoft), <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/pfsfile-pfsreport">PFS:File</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/thinktank-128">Think Tank</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/filevision">FileVision</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/games/mac-slots">Mac Slots</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/habadex">Habadex</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macdraft-12">Mac Draft</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/maclion">Mac Lion</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/musicworks">Music Works</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/clickart-publications">Click Art</a> and of course <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/overvue">OverVUE</a> (the direct predecessor to today&#39;s Panorama X). Of course all of these companies have long since disappeared, except for two — Microsoft and ProVUE Development. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty nice club.</p><p> I&#39;m quite proud to have kept ProVUE Development in the Macintosh database business every single day from then to now. The RAM based database concepts I started with in 1984 are still the core of the software today, of course much further developed. In fact, if you look at screen shots of the original OverVUE from 1984, and Panorama X from 2025, the family resemblance is unmistakeable. On the left is 68k assembly code using the original Mac ROMs, on the right is Objective-C using AppKit, but the concepts are the same. There are even databases that have been brought forward from the left all the way to the right — in continuous use over four decades!</p></blockquote><p> There are old-school Mac developers still going strong, and there are <em>old school</em> Mac developers still going strong. I&#39;m not sure about this “Microsoft” company, but ProVUE&#39;s achievement here is quite remarkable. Read through for Rea&#39;s 40% discount code to celebrate this 40-year anniversary. (Also, check out the screenshots and those crazy menu bar titles in the 1.0 version from 1984.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The 40th Anniversary of ProVUE at Macworld Expo’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/provue-macworld-expo-40">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/apple_pulls_advanced_data_protection_from_the_uk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3g" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41596</id><published> 2025-02-21T18:25:12Z</published><updated> 2025-02-22T00:05:00Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The UK&#39;s demands are simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the recent Salt Typhoon attack China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK&#39;s actual power and standing in the world. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple, in a very precisely worded statement issued to the media (including me) this morning:</p><blockquote><p> Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">As we have said many times before</a> , we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.</p></blockquote><p> The context for this is the news that broke two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM4OTA0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwMjg2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzg5MDQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImRiNmNkODlmLThiZjMtNDkwMy05ZjJlLTFkYmIxOGJmNTViNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDIvMDcvYXBwbGUtZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1iYWNrZG9vci11ay8ifQ.jmi16EkHDs4oV8NT_duwmo2NQd8rxE3enCtbFsh8KNU&amp;itid=gfta">by Joseph Menn in The Washington Post</a> , and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57b391a0-c531-4cde-a5e9-c5d60b21a161">Tim Bradshaw in the Financial Times</a> , that (quoting Menn&#39;s report, emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p> Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. The British government&#39;s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. [...]</p><p> The office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence, the people said. The law, known by critics as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, <em>makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand</em> . An Apple spokesman declined to comment.</p></blockquote><p> By definition, end-to-end encryption can have no secret backdoor, so compliance with this order from the UK would, in broad strokes, require Apple to abandon end-to-end encryption — not just for users in the UK but all users in all countries globally. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-21"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-21">1</a></sup> More insidiously and outrageously, they are apparently forbidden by UK law, under severe penalty (imprisonment), from even informing the public about this demand, or, if they were to comply, from telling the public what they&#39;ve done. The UK expects Apple to give them secret access to all iCloud data without Apple telling anyone — including, I believe, <em>even the US government</em> — that they&#39;ve granted the UK government this breathtaking access.</p><p> Rather than comply, Apple is choosing instead to pull Advanced Data Protection from the UK. For UK users not already using ADP, the ability to enable it was already turned off before Apple&#39;s statement was sent. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">This report from BBC News</a> has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/uk-adp-screenshot.jpeg">a screenshot</a> of what UK users see if they attempt to enable it today.</p><p> Re-read Apple&#39;s statement above, which I&#39;ve quoted in full, including the hyperlink. What stands out is that Apple is offering no explanation, not even a hint, <em>why</em> the company “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature”. On issues pertaining to security and privacy, Apple always explains its policies and features as best it can. The fact that Apple has offered no hint as to why they&#39;re doing this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">canary statement</a> of sorts: they&#39;re making clear as best they can that they&#39;re under a legal gag order that prevents them from even acknowledging that they&#39;re under a legal gag order, by not telling us why they&#39;re no longer able to offer ADP in the UK. This sort of read-between-the-lines implicit confirmation that they&#39;re under a gag order is the only sort of confirmation they can legally offer, at risk of imprisonment.</p><p> Enabling ADP is controlled server-side, so Apple was able to disable the ability for UK users to turn on ADP without requiring a software update to devices. But it&#39;s an open question how this will play out for users in the UK who already have ADP enabled. Apple cannot disable ADP remotely. With a moment&#39;s thought, you can realize why they can&#39;t: it would defeat the entire purpose. In the same way that Apple can&#39;t hold its own key to decrypt a user&#39;s data with ADP, they also can&#39;t hold the ability to disable ADP.</p><p> Enabling ADP is reversible, however. After turning it on, a user can revert to standard protection, turning it off. But they must <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/adp-turn-off-screenshot.png">manually confirm</a> it. I suspect what Apple is going to do for UK users with ADP already enabled is begin issuing warnings, instructing them to disable it manually, before some deadline. Once that deadline passes, I think Apple will have to stop allowing iCloud access to ADP-protected accounts in the UK. That won&#39;t leave the data of those users unprotected — they simply will lose access to sync until they disable ADP and revert to standard protection.</p><p> The bottom line is that the UK government is proceeding like a tyrannical authoritarian state.那不是夸张。 And the breathtaking scope of their order — being able to secretly snoop, without notice that they even have the capability, not only on their own citizens but every Apple user in the entire world — suggests a delusional belief that the British Empire still stands. It&#39;s simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hack-us-telecoms-salt-typhoon-88cabc592dae2fa870772c5ce4ace5ea">recent Salt Typhoon attack</a> China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK&#39;s actual power and standing in the world.</p><p> Apple is, rightly and righteously, telling them to fuck off.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-21"><p> If you use Advanced Data Protection, your iCloud data can only be decrypted (a) by your own devices, (b) using the recovery key that you control from when you enabled ADP, or (c) by any recovery contacts you&#39;ve created in iCloud. Apple insists that you must generate a recovery key or specify at least one recovery contact to enable ADP. Lose your devices, lose your recovery key, and lose your iCloud passphrase, and no one, including Apple, can recover your iCloud data. That level of cryptographically guaranteed security is the benefit of ADP. It&#39;s also the risk of ADP. And there&#39;s a convenience cost. For example, web access to iCloud. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Quoting from Apple&#39;s own ADP documentation</a> :</p><blockquote><p> When a user first turns on Advanced Data Protection, web access to their data at iCloud.com is automatically turned off. This is because iCloud web servers no longer have access to the keys required to decrypt and display the user&#39;s data. The user can choose to turn on web access again, and use the participation of their trusted device to access their encrypted iCloud data on the web.</p><p> After turning on web access, the user must authorize the web sign-in on one of their trusted devices each time they visit iCloud.com. The authorization “arms” the device for web access. For the next hour, this device accepts requests from specific Apple servers to upload individual service keys, but only those corresponding to an allow list of services normally accessible on iCloud.com. In other words, even after the user authorizes a web sign-in, a server request is unable to induce the user&#39;s device to upload service keys for data that isn&#39;t intended to be viewed on iCloud.com, (such as Health data or passwords in iCloud Keychain). Apple servers request only the service keys needed to decrypt the specific data that the user is requesting to access on the web. Every time a service key is uploaded, it is encrypted using an ephemeral key bound to the web session that the user authorized, and a notification is displayed on the user&#39;s device, showing the iCloud service whose data is temporarily being made available to Apple servers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s for reasons like “I lost my only device and forgot my iCloud password”, and to provide easy access to iCloud through the web, that Advanced Data Protection is not the default for all users.</p><p> I think it&#39;s technically possible that Apple could maintain “end-to-end encryption” in a pedantic sense while adding an additional UK-controlled signing key to all encrypted data in iCloud. Let&#39;s say you own two Apple devices, an iPhone and a Mac, and you use Advanced Data Protection. Your data can only be decrypted by those two devices, or by your recovery key, or by a device controlled by one of your recovery contacts. Apple could do something like add the UK government as, effectively, a recovery contact, to each and every user in the world&#39;s encrypted iCloud data. That would still be “end-to-end”, it&#39;s just that the UK government would control one of those end points. But the way iCloud security is designed, something like that cannot be added silently. When a new device is added to your iCloud account, all of your existing devices get a notification that a new device has been added. I personally see these notifications hundreds of times a year, every year, as I add new review unit devices to my account. Like back in September, I got four iPhone 16 review units, two Apple Watch review units, and purchased my own iPhone 16 Pro. And I own several Macs, several Apple Watches, and an iPad. Each one of those devices, when added to my iCloud account, even just temporarily for testing, generated a notification about the new device being added to my iCloud account to each and every one of my other devices, new or old, currently signed into my iCloud account. That&#39;s a minor annoyance for me as a product reviewer, but of course I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Apple&#39;s system is built such that new devices cannot be added to the chain without a notification being generated and sent to every existing device in your account. This notification regarding new devices happens even with standard protection — it&#39;s not exclusive to users who&#39;ve enabled ADP.</p><p> So while in theory some company could (I think?) build a system that is fairly (but deceptively) described as “end-to-end encrypted” where one of the “ends” is secretly and silently controlled by the UK government, Apple&#39;s iCloud is not such a system. Apple is prevented by UK law from explaining this, unfortunately, but I think it&#39;s true that as iCloud currently stands, Apple cannot comply with the UK&#39;s demands for ADP-protected accounts, because they can&#39;t add a UK-controlled decryption key to existing iCloud accounts without notifying every device signed into every account. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple Pulls Advanced Data Protection From the UK, in Defiance of UK Demand for Global Backdoor </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/thoughts_and_observations_on_todays_iphone_16e_announcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3b" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41591</id><published> 2025-02-20T04:42:10Z</published><updated> 2025-02-22T01:52:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">Tim Cook teased</a> a “newest member of the family” product announcement coming today; turns out it was <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/">the iPhone 16e</a> , a device whose name briefly paralyzed me with indecision regarding how to capitalize it, <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-19">1</a></sup> which replaces the three-year-old iPhone SE (3rd generation) in the lineup.</p><h2> The Announcement</h2><p> Apple made the announcement in a 13-minute video that is currently atop their home page, but seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">only perma-linkable at YouTube</a> . (Maybe <a href="https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-16e/2025/d9015f23-5cc1-45b4-b25a-2b1caee9d7ac/films/announcement/iphone-16e-announcement-tpl-us-2025_16x9.m3u8">this</a> ?) It was also, of course, announced in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a press release on Apple Newsroom</a> . The first three minutes of the video feature Tim Cook (talking about how great iPhones are, the iPhones 16 in particular, and Apple Intelligence). Cook hands things off to iPhone product marketing VP Kaiann Drance for the next five minutes; Drance mostly recaps iOS 18&#39;s tentpole features, especially, of course, Apple Intelligence. Drance hands off to keynote first-timer (I think) Lucy Browning, a director of iPhone product design, who talks up the 16e specifics. The most unusual thing about the video is its setting: not Apple Park, not the Steve Jobs Theater, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I&amp;t=2727s">the infinite white void</a> , where, in a bygone era, Apple TV commercials like the famed Hodgman/Long “I&#39;m a Mac / I&#39;m a PC” series were set. (The new infinite void is arguably light gray, not white.)</p><h2> The Name</h2><p> First, the name. It&#39;s not the fourth-generation iPhone SE, and instead sports an altogether new “e” suffix. Apple has used an “S” suffix with the iPhones 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS; “C” with the iPhone 5C, and “R” with the XR. We shall see if this “e” is a one-off. In an online press briefing today, when asked whether the “e” stands for anything, an Apple rep said no, it does not stand for anything, but that it&#39;s built for everyone. I don&#39;t think she meant to imply that the “e” secretly stands for <em>everyone</em> , if only because I&#39;m pretty sure Apple doesn&#39;t want everyone buying the lowest-price iPhone model. Apple never had an explanation for the “SE” name either, although in my head I&#39;ve already read that as maybe sorta kinda standing for <em>special edition</em> ? Way back in the day, I think Phil Schiller once said the “S” in “iPhone 3GS” stood for <em>speed</em> , because the 3GS was in fact strikingly faster than the prior year&#39;s 3G, and the “C” in “iPhone 5C” definitely, if unofficially, stood for <em>color</em> . But it&#39;s best not to waste too much time trying to find any logic to this other than that Apple thinks “iPhone 16e” looks and sounds cool. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not the “iPhone 16 AI”.</p><p> Using the “16” generation as part of the name is more interesting than the new “e” suffix. It perhaps suggests that e-edition phones might become annual. I wouldn&#39;t bet on that. But the SE models came out in March 2016, April 2020, and March 2022, so the gaps have been irregular. At the very least though, the 16e name will help make it clear, in years to come, what the basic specs of this iPhone were and when, roughly, it debuted. Every time I&#39;ve referenced the third-gen SE in the last year or two, I&#39;ve had to look up exactly when it debuted and which A-series chip it sported (A15, same as the iPhone 13).</p><h2>定价</h2><p>As expected, the existing third-gen iPhone SE is now out of the lineup. The third-gen SE debuted in March 2022 with a starting price of $430 (for a paltry 64 GB) with 128 and 256 GB configurations for, respectively, $480 and $580. The new iPhone 16e starts at $600, which, depending on how you look at it, is either a $170 increase (in the price of the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells) or a $120 increase (in the price of the cheapest 128 GB iPhone Apple sells). I&#39;ve already seen gobs of people arguing that the iPhone 16e “should” start at just $500, but if you look at Apple&#39;s pricing for the entire iPhone 16 lineup, there are $200 gaps, for the same storage tiers, between the 16e and regular 16, and between the regular 16 and 16 Pro. So I&#39;d argue that $600 is the “right” price. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39;s inflation calculator</a> , $500 in January 2022 is about $565 in January 2025 dollars.</p><p> Here&#39;s a table with the lineup of new iPhones Apple currently sells. I&#39;m including the now-discontinued iPhone SE for reference. Also note that while these are the only models Apple itself sells to consumers, other old models are still sold by various carriers and retail partners around the world, including the iPhone SE for now. </p><table class="table-5EE26071-E20E-463E-860C-F4FEB8AD1841" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The 16e does support inductive Qi charging, but only at a pokey 7.5-watt rate. The regular 16 and 16 Pro models support MagSafe charging at up to 25 watts, and the iPhone 15 at 15 watts. You can charge an iPhone 16e using a MagSafe charging puck, but only at 7.5 watts, and it won&#39;t magnetically snap into place. It&#39;ll just function as a non-magnetic pad. I don&#39;t know if this decision was about component pricing (the $200 difference has to come from somewhere, and it&#39;s not going to be Apple&#39;s margins), the internal space that MagSafe components occupy in the device (see next section), or marketing differentiation. Probably some combination of all three. The old SE only supported 7.5-watt no-MagSafe Qi charging as well.</p><h2>电池</h2><p>Battery life is better than the regular iPhone 16. This is equally surprising to me. From Apple&#39;s own Comparison page:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png" class="noborder"><img
    src   = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Apple's comparison of battery life specs between the iPhone 16 Pro, 16, and 16e."
    width = 525
  /></a></p><p> How exactly is the 16e achieving battery life that surpasses the more expensive iPhone 16, and is effectively on par with the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro? I suspect it&#39;s a combination of a larger battery and a more efficient cellular modem. As rumored, the 16e is Apple&#39;s first iPhone with an in-house–designed modem, which, in the video, Kaiann Drance introduces thus (emphasis added): “And with iPhone 16e, we&#39;re expanding the benefits of Apple silicon with C1, the first Apple-designed cellular modem. It provides fast and reliable 5G connectivity, and <em>it&#39;s the most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone</em> .” Just as with CPUs and GPUs, Apple&#39;s interest in custom silicon isn&#39;t only about price and performance — it&#39;s about efficiency too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=199">Drance then continues</a> (speaking over a cool breakaway animation of the 16e&#39;s internal components), “We combined the incredible power efficiency of Apple silicon with an all-new internal design for iPhone 16e that has been optimized for a larger battery. Together, it paves the way for an unprecedented level of battery life in a 6.1-inch iPhone.” There might be other changes that allow the 16e to accommodate a larger battery than the regular 16, but from the spec sheet, the obvious one is the omission of MagSafe.</p><h2> Apple&#39;s C1 Chip</h2><p> The power efficiency sounds great, and of course the modem supports “5G”, but it doesn&#39;t support mmWave / ultra wideband, the crazy super-fast variant of 5G with Wi-Fi-like speed <em>and</em> Wi-Fi-like short range from carrier antennas that serve it. Block-by-block here at home in Philadelphia, I see ultra wideband from Verizon on some blocks of the city ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118203">denoted by the “5G UW” icon in the status bar</a> ), but not most. But do I really care? I honestly don&#39;t know why I&#39;m supposed to care about 5G at all compared to LTE. Using LTE instead of 5G (let alone 5G ultra wideband) makes no practical difference for anything I do over cellular on my phone. Obviously Apple wants to support ultra wideband in its own modems eventually, but their renewed deal with Qualcomm — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">announced and crowed-about only by Qualcomm</a> , because Apple despises them and deeply resents its own dependence upon them — covers “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026”. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a C-series chip in this September&#39;s expected iPhone 17 or 17 Pro — but perhaps we&#39;ll see one in the rumored iPhone 17 “Air”.</p><p> Remember too that when last I saw it tested — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">by Nicole Nguyen in 2022</a> — disabling 5G and exclusively using LTE extended the battery life of an iPhone 13 Pro from 13 to 15.5 hours in her video-streaming test. Ultra wideband 5G <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">is indeed insanely fast</a> , and regular 5G is generally faster than LTE, but for most people in most places not in ways that practically matter, especially considering the effects on battery life. “Plenty fast enough, with longer battery life” is a better trade-off than “way faster than you&#39;ll notice, with somewhat shorter battery life”.</p><p> Speaking of wireless, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the C1 chip, but the iPhone 16e supports only Wi-Fi 6, not 7, and doesn&#39;t support Thread networking.</p><h2> Just One Camera on the Back, but It&#39;s “2-in-1”</h2><p> No surprise here — cameras are expensive, and only offering one makes for very obvious differentiation. Apple&#39;s calling this lone camera “2-in-1” because, like the main camera on other recent iPhone models, it offers both 1× and 2× <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6110937480">optical fields of view</a> (1× uses the entire 48MP sensor, producing a 12MP image by treating the sensor pixel array as “quad pixels; 2× produces 12MP images by cropping the center 12MP of the sensor). The lack of a second ultra-wide camera means not just no 0.5× lens, but also no macro photography, and no spatial photos or video. The 16e also offers only “Photographic Styles”, not the “latest-generation Photographic Styles” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16#photography">offered by the 16 and 16 Pro</a> .</p><p> If you really care about your <em>camera</em> , the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t the iPhone for you. As mentioned above, it has fewer lenses and the imaging pipeline doesn&#39;t support the next-generation Photographic Styles (which, five months in, I continue to really enjoy in my own photography). But that doesn&#39;t mean the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t a valid choice for people who care about their photos. Some people really do care about their photography, but also really just point and shoot using their main 1× camera, no matter which iPhone model they own. Not worrying about camera hardware and only concerning yourself with lighting and framing is a philosophy shared by many seriously talented photographers.</p><h2> No Camera Control Button</h2><p> The other camera-hardware-related ding against the 16e is that it doesn&#39;t have the new Camera Control button/slider on the side. I know several iPhone 16 owners who claim they never use it or even flat out dislike it, because they find themselves invoking it only by accident. I really like it, and use it as my primary way to launch the Camera app and to capture images. But, you know, we all captured images and videos just fine for 17 iPhone generations without that hardware button. No matter how much you like it, you certainly don&#39;t need it.</p><p> But, up until now, you <em>did</em> need the Camera Control button to invoke <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-visual-intelligence-with-camera-control-iph12eb1545e/ios">the visual intelligence feature of Apple Intelligence</a> . A press-and-release of Camera Control launches your favorite camera app; a long-press invokes visual intelligence. Apple&#39;s solution to enable visual intelligence on the iPhone 16e, despite it lacking the Camera Control button, is two-fold. First, visual intelligence is now available in Control Center. Second, as demonstrated by Apple in the announcement video, you can assign the Action Button to visual intelligence. (By default, just as with other iPhones equipped with the Action Button, it defaults to toggling silent mode, like the dedicated ringer switch of yore — where by “yore” I mean still on the iPhone 15.)</p><p> Apple representatives also told me today that owners of the iPhone 15 Pro will soon be able to bind their Action Button to visual intelligence, “in a future software update”. I suspect that future software update is iOS 18.4, which should be launching in beta any day now, but Apple wouldn&#39;t comment, on or off the record, when exactly this feature will come to the iPhone 15 Pro. They also confirmed that the Control Center button to launch visual intelligence is also coming to iPhone 15 Pro (and presumably iPhone 16 models, too). The iPhone 15 Pro, despite qualifying for Apple Intelligence, has heretofore lacked the visual intelligence feature, because the visual intelligence feature has only been trigger-able via the Camera Control button. It&#39;s a little odd, frankly, that Apple didn&#39;t enable this feature via the Action Button and Control Center for 15 Pro users months ago — perhaps they really wanted to wait for the 16e announcement?</p><h2>展示</h2><p>The 16e display specs seem pretty good, but the front sensor array is behind a notch, not a dynamic island. That&#39;s a reasonable design trade-off for the lowest-price model. The 16 and 16 Pro displays offer maximum brightness specs of 1,000 nits (typical), 1,600 nits (HDR), and 2,000 nits (outdoor). The 16e display offers 800 nits (typical), 1,200 (HDR), and doesn&#39;t go higher than that. The 16 and 16 Pro dislays also go down to just 1 nit minimum brightness; Apple doesn&#39;t list a minimum brightness for the 16e display.</p><h2>硅</h2><p>The A18 chip in the iPhone 16e seems (on the specs page) nearly identical to that of the iPhone 16, except for the number of GPU cores: the 16e has only 4 GPU cores, but the regular iPhone 16 has 5. (The A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max has 6 GPU cores.) No big whoop.</p><p> What&#39;s more interesting than comparing to the iPhone 16 is comparing to the iPhone 15, which costs $100 more than the 16e. Because the only A17-generation chip was the A17 Pro that went into the iPhone 15 Pro models, the regular iPhone 15 has the same A16 chip from the iPhone 14 model year. Aside from all the general performance improvements in the A18 compared to the two-year-old A16, the big functional difference is that the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 15 does not. As covered extensively when Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC last June, that&#39;s mainly a function of RAM, but whatever the reasons, the less expensive iPhone 16e has Apple Intelligence, and the iPhone 15 does not. Maybe that&#39;s not a <em>big</em> whoop, but it&#39;s definitely a whoop of some sort.</p><p> Perhaps, like the three generations of SE models, the iPhone 16e is designed to stay around for several years at this price point. If it does, the fact that it costs $100 less than the “year-old regular iPhone” will make more sense come September, when that $700 year-old model is the iPhone 16. But until September, the iPhone 16e looks like a better phone in several ways than the iPhone 15. It has a faster chip that supports Apple Intelligence and significantly longer battery life. The iPhone 15 does have a 0.5× ultra-wide camera, and it has a slightly better display (that includes the nicer dynamic island instead of a notch). And of course the iPhone 15 comes in colors like pink, yellow, green, and blue. But if you keep your phone in a case all the time, like most people do, you probably don&#39;t care about the color of your phone much. The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less.</p><h2>颜色</h2><p>You can get any color 16e that you want, so long as it&#39;s black or white. The third-gen iPhone SE came in midnight, starlight, and Product Red. (Is Apple done partnering with Product Red now? I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-marks-world-aids-day-with-red/">Apple Watch Series 9 was the last device offered with Product Red</a> .)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-19"><p> For a while with the iPhone 4S, there was some ambiguity whether Apple intended the “S” to be upper- or lowercase, because their marketing materials used a small-cap “S”, and a small-cap “S” looks almost exactly like a lowercase “s”. They settled on uppercase for the 4S. But when the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, Apple not only styled both of those suffixes lowercase, they retroactively re-styled the &#39;S&#39; in the &#39;4S&#39; as lowercase. I wrote about this at length <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">in this footnote in my iPhone 5S and 5C review in 2013</a> , in which I explained my decision to uppercase them. But I sort of like the way “16e” looks. It&#39;s ... friendly? And the lowercase “e” carries the correct implication that this is a lesser sibling to the regular iPhone 16, not an upgrade or superior of some sort. So for now, I&#39;m going with the flow and keeping the “e” lowercase. One friend, to whom I vented my consternation regarding how to handle this, unhelpfully suggested I go with <em>iPhone 16ᵉ</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Thoughts and Observations on Today&#39;s iPhone 16e Announcement </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w36" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41586</id><published> 2025-02-18T04:40:38Z</published><updated> 2025-02-19T17:12:37Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order.

<p>You saw the news last week, I&#39;m sure, that both of the major mapping-app providers, Google and Apple, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">have updated their maps to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”</a> . Microsoft&#39;s Bing Maps, which I would describe as a minor provider, has made the change too. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-17">1</a></sup> It&#39;s all actually quite a bit more complicated than “they renamed the Gulf of Mexico”, but bear with me for now.</p><p> You&#39;ve also seen, I&#39;m equally sure, a lot of people angry at Google and Apple for going along with this. That anger is — to some degree — misplaced. I get where the anger comes from, but it&#39;s still misplaced. My initial take, right in the midst of Trump&#39;s inauguration speech on January 20, was that if he went through with it, Apple and Google and everyone else who publishes maps should just ignore it. Trump, obviously, did go through with it: the United States Geological Survey, an agency within the Department of the Interior, which is within the executive branch and thus under the president&#39;s purview, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/gulf-america">officially made the change on February 7</a> . Now that it&#39;s official US government policy, “just ignore it” really isn&#39;t feasible. If that&#39;s still your stance, I implore you to consider at least a bit more nuance.</p><p> But let&#39;s first stipulate up front that there are multiple far more important and urgent issues facing the United States and the world, just four short weeks into the Trump 2.0 administration. Off the top of my head: Ukraine, Gaza, tariffs, DOGE, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/nyregion/scotten-letter.html?unlocked_article_code=1.w04.Lkj2.Tu4sBTtDGwqQ&amp;smid=url-share">the rule of law</a> . Whether you approve or disapprove of Trump&#39;s actions on any or all of those issues, there should be no question that all of them are important and consequential. The name we see on maps for a body of water, not as much. But it&#39;s the smallness, the relative unimportance, the spiteful pettiness of the renaming in the first place — down to the fact that until Trump&#39;s executive action, there was no controversy, <em>zero</em> , <em>none</em> , <em>nada</em> , anywhere in the world, amongst any group of people, regarding the name of the Gulf of Mexico — that makes it interesting to examine in detail how Google and Apple have chosen to deal with it. It&#39;s only because this particular issue is so spectacularly piddling that we can consider it in full.</p><p> The motivation behind the name change is simple as well. Trump didn&#39;t change the US&#39;s officially recognized name of, say, the Atlantic Ocean or the continent of Africa. He just as easily could, but he won&#39;t. And it&#39;s not like “Gulf of Mexico” was on a list of “debatable or controversial names” until he created this controversy out of thin air. It&#39;s just the one name on the globe that a president of the United States can change to stick it to Mexico, a country Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/judge-curiel-trump-border-wall/index.html">has objectively racist feelings toward</a> . Trump never campaigned on building a wall at our <em>northern</em> border with Canada, nor has he (yet?) attempted to rename Lake Ontario. It&#39;s about Mexico, and asserting power by fiat. Trump has a lifelong history of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trump-in-name-only-how-investors-lost-millions-buying-into-t">putting his name on buildings he doesn&#39;t own</a> . He&#39;d rather have his name emblazoned on a building he doesn&#39;t own than own a building that doesn&#39;t bear his name. To Trump, the name on the sign is more important than the deed. So too, now, with the name on a map. The Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water that belongs to no nation, but declaring this new name implies that it heretofore belonged to Mexico, and now belongs to us, which is to say belongs to him, our unquestioned dear leader. That Trump took it from Mexico, without firing a shot — when in fact all he did was order a string to be changed in a government database. Shakespeare would have us believe that a sea by any other name would taste as salty. Trump doesn&#39;t read Shakespeare.</p><h2> How Google and Apple Are Labelling the Gulf, Globally</h2><p> The first important thing to know is that Google Maps and Apple Maps are not singular global atlases. They both show different names (and in rare cases, different geographies) in different regions around the world. They each are more like a collection of regional atlases. In constrast, there&#39;s only one <a href="https://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a> . If the OED changes a word&#39;s definition, or adds a new word, those changes appear to everyone in the world. My OED is your OED, no matter where you and I live or currently find ourselves on the globe. Google and Apple Maps aren&#39;t like that. It&#39;s better to think of them as services that provide region-by-region maps.</p><p> Google, to their credit, has a blog post <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">describing and illustrating exactly what users around the world now see in Google Maps</a> :</p><blockquote><p> In the US, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) has officially <a href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730">updated</a> “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” As we <a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951">announced</a> two weeks ago and consistent with our longstanding practices, we&#39;ve begun rolling out changes to reflect this update. People using Maps in the US will see “Gulf of America,” and people in Mexico will see “Gulf of Mexico.” Everyone else will see both names.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/google-maps-gulf.png">As their illustration shows</a> , “both names” means putting “Gulf of America” in parentheses for users who are anywhere else in the world other than the US or Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</p><p> Apple&#39;s approach has been more Apple-like, which is to say without comment. They made no public comment before changing the name in Apple Maps, and they have made no public comment since. (I&#39;ve asked Apple PR for comment, but gotten none.) I&#39;d appreciate a statement, like Google&#39;s, stating what users around the world should expect to see. But I also understand their desire to say as little as possible. In a sense, the labels on Apple Maps speak for themselves, and are the only thing that actually matters. I also appreciate, that by never declaring a policy on the matter, Apple can change its map labels without rescinding or amending a policy.</p><p> So without a statement from Apple describing how the Gulf is labelled around the world, I did what I could: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114003192100392251">I asked my followers on Mastodon who are outside the US what they saw as the Gulf&#39;s name</a> , and to include screenshots if possible. That was on Friday, 14 February, after Apple Maps began showing “Gulf of America” in place of “Gulf of Mexico” to users here in the US. The response was overwhelming, with replies from people in over two dozen countries from around the world. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-17">2</a></sup> And at the time, their replies suggested that Apple was taking a subtly but intriguingly different approach from Google. To wit, while everyone in the US saw “Gulf of America” (with no mention of the established name), everyone everywhere else in the world still saw “Gulf of Mexico” (or their language&#39;s translation of that name), with no mention, in parentheses or otherwise, of the new name now recognized by the United States.</p><p> I hoped that that was Apple&#39;s plan, which would have been quietly subversive in isolating the United States as the only country in the world to even see the name “Gulf of America”. But I feared that Apple was simply slower than Google, that changes had been applied for users in the US first, but changes for the rest of the world simply hadn&#39;t propagated. My fears were warranted.</p><p> Late in the evening (US Eastern Time) on Saturday, 15 February, new responses to my entreaty on Mastodon began showing labels in Apple Maps that matched Google&#39;s:</p><ul><li> In the US: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> In Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> I believe that the determining factor for what label you see, at least for Apple Maps, is unrelated to your physical location as determined by GPS or your IP address, but simply the region setting of your OS. On both MacOS and iOS, that&#39;s in Settings → General → Language &amp; Region → Region. This makes sense — you can use Apple Maps (and Google Maps) with Location Services turned off. You can play with this setting on your device to see what users around the world see in Maps without leaving your home, and without changing your device&#39;s language. Thus, if you&#39;re an American with your device set to the “United States” region, if you travel outside the US without changing your device settings, you&#39;ll still see the US-specific new name for the gulf: “Gulf of America”, with its historic and world-recognized name — dare I say, its unambiguously <em>correct</em> name — not even referenced in parentheses.</p><h2> The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment</h2><p> This whole thing, needless to say, sucks. It&#39;s profoundly stupid, and the aspects that aren&#39;t stupid are jingoistic. But the notion that Google or Apple might reasonably just ignore this and tell Trump (and the entire Republican Party, and their supporters) to go pound sand is facile. I&#39;m not saying they <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do it. Of course they <em>could</em> . That&#39;s like saying Trump <em>can&#39;t</em> just declare a new name for an international body of water with a heretofore uncontroversial 400-year-old name.</p><p> But it wouldn&#39;t be reasonable. It is reasonable for Google and Apple Maps to defer to, or at least acknowledge, the officially recognized names for each region in which they&#39;re available. It&#39;s not Google&#39;s or Apple&#39;s place to determine and adjudicate the official names on a map; their job is to recognize and display those names. In theory Google and/or Apple <em>could</em> position themselves as a global authoritative reference for geographic names. To be to maps something akin to the OED or Merriam-Webster to the English language. But if they were to pursue that route they&#39;d put themselves in the position of adjudicating any and all controversies and disputes over names and borders. Civic government is where we should <em>want</em> such disputes arbitrated, if not resolved. Not by private companies. If Apple Maps is to be available in China, Apple Maps needs to present names and borders ( <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">and even the size of land masses</a> — more on this below) that are amenable to the Chinese government. China sticks out because their demands are in stark contrast to the names and borders recognized by the rest of the world. Chinese maps are governed by CCP-mandated dogma. Most maps are governed by geographic and geopolitical reality. Taiwan, for example, is in fact an independent nation. Chinese maps (including those served by Apple to mainland Chinese users) label Taiwan as a province of China.</p><p> Now the United States is governed by another such dogma-driven regime.</p><p> In theory, maps ought not be political. In practice, they are and always have been. In theory, reasonable decisions and objectively correct decisions are one and the same when it comes to cartography. In practice, politics intercedes and they conflict. You can argue (and many people are) that Google and Apple should stick with the 400-year-old, recognized-the-world-over, and heretofore uncontroversial name “Gulf of Mexico”, and apply it globally. To simply ignore the new officially-recognized name of the gulf by the United States government. They <em>could</em> do that. No one would go to prison if they did. There would be no fines. But there would be a price to pay. Ignoring the new “Gulf of America” name recognized by the US government would, without question, court controversy. Republicans started to complain <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dan-crenshaw-complains-to-tim-cook-that-apple-maps-hasn-t-changed-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america/ar-AA1xIK2t">that Apple Maps hadn&#39;t adopted the new name</a> three weeks ago, before the change was even made official in the government&#39;s GNIS reference database.</p><p> To ignore political reality is to court political controversy. It is not in the interests of large multinational corporations to court controversy. But it&#39;s not possible to <em>avoid</em> controversy. What is reasonable is to minimize controversy. There&#39;s a famous quote from Michael Jordan, when he declined to publicly endorse the Democratic challenger to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/08/29/jesse-helms-white-racist/42090cb6-2e9b-4b13-a820-2a9b74c88fbe/">unabashedly racist</a> Republican Jesse Helms in the 1990 North Carolina Senate race: “ <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29130478/michael-jordan-stands-firm-republicans-buy-sneakers-too-quote-says-was-made-jest">Republicans buy sneakers, too.</a>透明</p><p>Some might say “That&#39;s the problem with capitalism.” I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s one of the <em>benefits</em> of capitalism. Unless you think extreme polarization is in the service of society, you want to see major institutions that are apolitical. For-profit corporations naturally serve that role. Yes, there&#39;s a profit motive. Republicans don&#39;t just buy sneakers, they buy phones and conduct web searches too. But who wants to see a world where everything is polarized politically, where every retailer, every device maker, every online service provider, every restaurant, every single thing you do, buy, or visit, is viewed through a polarized political prism? That way lies madness.</p><p> Most Americans, and most people in the western world, are beyond exhausted by our current levels of societal polarization. Escalating tensions further is not just contrary to the bottom-line interests of Apple and Google, it&#39;s in none of our interests. People just want good accurate maps. They don&#39;t want to choose — or worse, to be forced to choose — between right-leaning maps and left-leaning maps.</p><p> So if your argument is that neither Apple nor Google should be showing the name “Gulf of America” to anyone, anywhere, I&#39;m with you that that&#39;s the correct cartographical stance. But it would constitute political malpractice. Maps are important services to both companies, but the editorial integrity of their maps isn&#39;t close to their primary business or purpose. Maps aren&#39;t to Google or Apple what the English language is to the OED or Merriam-Webster. (Or what the news is to, say, the Associated Press. Hold that thought.)</p><p> So whether Google and Apple should show the new name at all shouldn&#39;t be the question we&#39;re asking. The right question is necessarily more nuanced: Who should see which names, where? And Google and Apple&#39;s answers to <em>that</em> question are, alas, disappointing and worrisome. I&#39;ll repeat the seemingly identical policy both companies are <em>actually</em> presenting today, by region:</p><ul><li> United States: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> The best politically realistic option they could have chosen would be (I&#39;ll use italics to emphasize that these are my own suggestions):</p><ul><li> <em>United States: “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”</em> .</li><li> <em>Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico”</em> .</li></ul><p> There&#39;s no good reason to even show “Gulf of America” in parentheses outside the US. We&#39;re the ones with the stupid name change on the books, so we&#39;re the ones who should get stuck seeing the stupid name. No one else should suffer the consequences of our political idiocy. But it <em>is</em> correct to show us, in America, the new dumb “Gulf of America” name. Again, if it were up to me, American users would see “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”, and everyone else would just see “Gulf of Mexico”. But that&#39;s surely the best we in the reality-based community could hope for.</p><p> It&#39;s absurd that users here in the US no longer see “Gulf of Mexico” at all. You can search for that term, and the “Gulf of America” will be the first result, but the 400-year-old name “Gulf of Mexico” no longer appears as a label on maps to US-region users for either Google Maps or Apple Maps. In any even vaguely reasonable political climate, even those in favor of the name change would endorse, perhaps even insist upon, a transitional period where the previous, familiar name appears in parentheses. Insisting that the name be changed in a snap, with no parenthetical reference to the previous name (a name that, again, has been recognized globally for over 400 years, and remains on every single printed map in existence, and every single work of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-old-man-and-the-sea-the-hemingway-library-edition-ernest-hemingway/15532053?ean=9781476787848&amp;next=t&amp;next=t">literature</a> and history referencing the Gulf) has some truly Orwellian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a> vibes. We&#39;ve always been at war with Eastasia. It&#39;s always been the Gulf of America.</p><p> The US political right often makes use of the term “ <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/snowflake/">snowflake</a> ” to suggest that those on the left are delicate and fragile. But it sure seems snowflaky to object to “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” as a map label. Sticks and stones may break their bones but a historically accurate parenthetical map label will hurt them? Food for thought as you enjoy your <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/congress-french-freedom-fries-iraq/">freedom fries</a> .</p><p> Consider the simple premise that a map ought to make sense to someone who doesn&#39;t follow current events. That ought to be uncontroversial. But to someone who has tuned out of the news for the last two months this change must seem downright baffling. Even worse, it&#39;s misleading. There&#39;s no reason for most people even to suspect, let alone know, that both Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and labels. Americans, in general, tend to be parochial. Showing Americans the name “Gulf of America”, without “(Gulf of Mexico)” strongly implies that this is now the new world-recognized name, when in the fact the truth is quite the opposite: it&#39;s a name recognized by one and only one country. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-17">3</a></sup></p><p> Not showing the new name, at all, to Americans would be unreasonably provocative to the Trump administration and its supporters. But showing the new name to every region in the world but Mexico itself is needlessly obsequious to Trump and his supporters. And making Mexico an exception to global naming policy isn&#39;t an honor or a favor to them — it&#39;s an implied insult. It insinuates that there&#39;s something wrong with them, too, legitimizing the notion that outside the US Trumpist right, there&#39;s a legitimate debate about the Gulf&#39;s name. The implied message is “ <em>Here you go, you delicate idiots, we&#39;ll make you the second of only two nations in the world regarding the displayed name of this body of water — you, and the United States.</em> ” Mexico neither asked for nor provoked any of this. (Mexico only achieved independence from Spain in 1821; the “Gulf of Mexico” name is twice as old as Mexico as a nation, and at least 150 years older than the United States.)</p><p> There are numerous countries where Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and differing disputed borders ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/9wq9vf/why_is_there_no_border_on_google_maps_between/">or lack thereof</a> ). From <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/">a 2020 report in The Washington Post</a> :</p><blockquote><p> And the line in Western Sahara marking the northern border with Morocco disappears for Moroccans seeking it out on the Web — along with the region&#39;s name altogether. The sparsely populated northwest Africa region is disputed between Morocco, which seized it in 1975, and the indigenous Sahrawi.</p><p> Sometimes that flies in the face of international consensus. Google Maps users inside Turkey can find the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or TRNC, represented in the northern third of the Mediterranean island nation. The territory is not recognized by the United Nations, nor Google&#39;s mapping competitors.</p></blockquote><p> There are other places around the world where Apple and Google show downright crazy or incorrect things on maps. The latter have one thing in common: they are to comply with the demands of countries governed by thin-skinned autocratic men who surround themselves with sycophants. As mentioned above, in China, Taiwan <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/fact-check-apple-maps-taiwan-03072024174451.html">is falsely labelled as a province of China in Apple Maps</a> . <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-17">4</a></sup> (Google Maps, like Google services generally, aren&#39;t available in China.) In 2021, in a report for The Information headlined “ <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">Inside Tim Cook&#39;s Secret $275 Billion Deal with Chinese Authorities</a> ”, Wayne Ma reported:</p><blockquote><p> Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China&#39;s State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu Islands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from them. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn&#39;t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.</p><p> Some members of the team back at Apple&#39;s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps app had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company complied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in mainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than surrounding territories.</p></blockquote><p> You&#39;ll stand on firm ground criticizing Apple for capitulating to China&#39;s demands on that. But the root problem clearly isn&#39;t Apple. It&#39;s that China is governed by communist authoritarians, and authoritarianism warps minds — including those of the authoritarian leaders themselves. You know what no one says? “ <em>The leadership of China is completely sane and sensible, and their edicts are based on reality, not dogma.</em>透明</p><p>If you don&#39;t see that Trump&#39;s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is on the same spectrum of nuttiness, then your mind, at least on this matter, has been warped. We can argue how far along that spectrum this “Gulf of America” thing is, but the only reasonable debate is of matters of degree. Apple and Google&#39;s decision to show this made-up name in parentheses to everyone around the world is akin to showing China&#39;s fictionally inflated size of the Diaoyu Islands to everyone in the world, as, say, a dotted outline surrounding the geographically accurate representations of the actual islands&#39; sizes. There&#39;s a word for this stuff, and that word is <em>propaganda</em> .</p><p> Imagine if the government of France decreed that the English Channel was now the “French Channel”. Now imagine that Google and Apple Maps complied, even just to the degree of changing the label, <em>outside</em> France (which, per their company policies, should see “French Channel”) and the United Kingdom (which would still see only “English Channel”) to show the rest of the world, including us in the United States, “English Channel (French Channel)”. It would rightfully be considered insulting nonsense.</p><p> The only difference from my hypothetical and our reality with the Gulf of Mexico is that France, in addition to not having a narcissistic would-be autocrat as its president ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-gets-new-government-after-weeks-uncertainty-2024-09-21/">yet</a> ?), is not the world&#39;s lone remaining superpower. That&#39;s what makes Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s acquiescence worrisome, not merely irritating. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamellebouie.net/post/3lia22gxsgk24">pithily observed over the weekend</a> , on Bluesky, “My take is that your willingness to accept this Gulf of America nonsense is an indicator of your willingness to accept much worse things coming from this administration.”</p><p> The calculus Google and Apple should naturally be striving to achieve is finding the correct balance between two axes. One axis is integrity: both the cartographic integrity of the labels on the companies&#39; maps, and the institutional integrity — <em>dignity</em> even — of the companies themselves. Billions of people around the world trust Google and Apple. Their decisions on this mapping matter — no matter how trivial in the grand scheme of things — should strengthen, not erode, that trust.</p><p> The other axis is the minimization of controversy.</p><p> Simply maximizing integrity — by ignoring the “Gulf of America” name completely — would incur volcanic controversy within the United States. This calculated balance is behind my suggestion of showing “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” within the United States, and showing just “Gulf of Mexico” everywhere else. Perhaps the inclusion of the longstanding name within parentheses is too much for freedom-fry-eating Republicans. But showing the new “Gulf of America” name in parentheses to everyone around the world is itself incurring controversy, and, more tellingly, is a strike against the integrity of both the companies and their maps.</p><p> Obsequiousness is inherently undignified. Google and Apple are proud companies. But both have chosen a gratuitously undignified presentation of this new American-dictated name to the entire world. Their mutual decision here ultimately seems driven not by integrity (to be sure), nor the minimization of controversy, but instead by a third, unnatural factor: fear.</p><p> Neither company will comment on it but surely this issue — inconsequential in the grand scheme of things though it may be — rose to the highest ranks of leadership. I&#39;ll eat my hat if Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook didn&#39;t both sign off on, if not actively participate in the decision-making process, how to represent the Gulf of Mexico&#39;s name. Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. But so eager are Pichai and Cook to avoid the wrath and vindictiveness of Trump that they&#39;re willing to peddle his foolish “Gulf of America” name to everyone in the world who doesn&#39;t live in Mexico. Wrapping it in parentheses is like wrapping a dead fish in newspaper — it doesn&#39;t contain the stench.</p><p> Of course “The Gulf of America” name is stupid. Trump is stupid. Not stupid meaning dim or dull — would that he were, but he remains sharp, cunning, and highly agitated — but stupid because he&#39;s nuts, warped by a narcissistic disorder of Napoleonic dimensions. The new name is as stupid as his MAGA hats are ugly. He might as well have sold<a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Subsidized_Time">the naming rights</a> to Musk and Tesla. There is something really wrong with him, and this “Gulf of America” name change exemplifies at least one aspect of his narcissistic insanity.每个人都知道。 Even his supporters know it. They just tell themselves it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s how tribalism morphs into cultism.</p><p> The false note in Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s parable “The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes” is that once the emperor is called out, for in fact strutting around stark naked while ostensibly wearing a suit of clothes so fine that they&#39;ve visible only to the eyes of smart and discerning people, is that <em>all</em> the townsfolk laugh at him. That wouldn&#39;t happen. Many would laugh. Most, one hopes. But the emperor&#39;s die-hard supporters would react with anger at the outburst of mockery, not join in the laughter. He looks great, they&#39;d insist, not like the jackass their own lying eyes tell them he is.</p><p> There is something wrong with Trump — and there is something lesser, but worrisomely wrong with those defending him.</p><p> Apple Maps and Google Maps do not consider themselves cartographic editorial authorities. They choose not to show one universal set of mapping (and naming) data to the world. They could.但是他们没有。 Actual editorial authorities, on the other hand, are under no obligation to follow the US GNIS&#39;s official decisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Wikipedia correctly still calls it The Gulf of Mexico</a> . The Associated Press, whose stylebook is followed by many publications, small and large, <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/">issued the following guidance after Trump&#39;s executive order last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The body of water has shared borders between the US and Mexico. Trump&#39;s order only carries authority within the United States. Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.</p></blockquote><p> The Trump administration — petty, stupid, vindictive, and most of all, <em>insecure</em> fools that they are — has lashed out, and is now in the midst of a weeklong standoff <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/white-house-continues-its-absurd-ban-against-the-associated-press/">during which they&#39;ve prevented AP journalists from attending official events</a> , entirely and solely because of the AP&#39;s perfectly reasonable style guidance on the Gulf&#39;s name. If Trump and his 2.0 administration had any modicum of confidence that this name change is correct and justified, they&#39;d roll their eyes, not lash out, at the Associated Press for continuing to stipulate otherwise. What kind of government does stuff like that? Everyone knows the answer: tin-pot dictator autocracies. (And <em>would-be</em> autocracies, we can hope.) <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-17">5</a></sup> This whole “Gulf of America” thing is, if you take a step back, objectively hilarious. Like Pinocchio turning into a real boy, Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico is like a late night comedy joke turned real. It&#39;s beyond parody. If this had been on SNL during the 2024 campaign, you&#39;d have laughed. And you should laugh now. Mockery is a powerfully subversive weapon against authority — even more effective, I&#39;d argue, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists">than a guitar</a> .</p><p> But it&#39;s worth directing our laughter at Google and Apple as well. They&#39;re squandering their own hard-earned reputations for integrity to suggest there&#39;s even a parenthetical alternative-name level of international legitimacy — not merely one man&#39;s vanity — behind this.没有。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-17"><p> <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> , god bless them, are still labelling it “Gulf of Mexico”.

  /></a></p><p> I noticed the change immediately (of course), and my knee-jerk instant reaction was negative. <em>Too big, too bold, too different. Don&#39;t like.</em>那很自然。 Human beings evolved to be alarmed by change. If everything looks the same as usual, everything is probably as safe as usual. If something looks jarringly different, it might be a sign that you&#39;re about to be killed. (Evolutionarily speaking.)</p><p> So I started studying and <em>considering</em> the changes to Fox&#39;s scorebug. I quickly not only warmed up to the new scorebug, I decided I <em>really</em> like it. It&#39;s better than Fox&#39;s old one, and better than every other network&#39;s (which all largely look the same), in almost every single regard.</p><p> I like the new scorebug so much I (cross-)posted about it to social media during the game. My posts, in order of engagement: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">Threads</a> (~6,600 likes, ~700 replies and reposts), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">Bluesky</a> (~3,900 likes, ~600 replies and reposts), and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">Mastodon</a> (179 likes, 53 replies and reposts).</p><p> No change an app developer can make will generate more commentary and emotional feedback from users than changing the app&#39;s icon. Everyone sees an app&#39;s icon, and has an opinion about them. That opinion, after a change, is usually “ <em>I like the old icon and hate the new one.</em> ” Likewise with a game broadcast&#39;s scorebug — everyone sees them, and everyone has an opinion when they change. Most reactions to Fox&#39;s new scorebug were negative, and many of those were <em>really</em> negative. Yahoo Sports ran a story under the headline “ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">Super Bowl: Fox Sports Debuts New Scorebug, to Universally Negative Reaction</a> ”. The sports media-focused site Awful Announcing ran a take by Drew Lerner under the headline “ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">Please Stop Debuting New Scorebugs During the Super Bowl</a> ” (subhead: “Can&#39;t I just watch one Super Bowl without having to learn a new graphic?”). I have not even come close to reading all the replies to my social media take (well, except on Mastodon — it was quick to catch up there), but if you peruse them, you&#39;ll be quick to see that most replies are from people who despise the change. A representative tasting:</p><p> “ <em>It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn&#39;t bother having someone check it first.可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “<em>哈哈。 Muted for being a dumbass.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>It&#39;s hideous, and its overbearing size distracts from the actual content of the game.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don&#39;t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.</em>透明</p><p>“Looks like something out of Fortnite” isn&#39;t the dis the last commenter thinks it is. A lot of people play and love Fortnite.</p><p> Here&#39;s an expanded (from what I posted to social media) version of why I like, perhaps even love, the new scorebug. First, the primary items: who&#39;s playing and what&#39;s the score:</p><ul><li> <em>Team initialisms</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Team logos</em> : None. Colors say enough.</li><li> <em>Score</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Game clock</em> : Big enough and centered.</li><li> <em>Needless chrome</em> : None.</li></ul><p> Every team in the league is known by fans by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation of its home location, sort of like airport codes or stock tickers. They&#39;re all obvious ( <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">unlike many</a> airport codes). The Dallas Cowboys are DAL. The New England Patriots are NE. For the two cities which have two teams, New York and Los Angeles, the cities conveniently abbreviate to two letters and a third letter is drawn from the team nicknames: the Giants and Jets are NYG and NYJ; the Rams and Chargers are LAR and LAC.</p><p> Team logos are not as instantly identifiable, especially at small sizes. A bunch of teams have angry bird mascots: Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Cardinals. Do you remember the Tennessee Titans&#39; logo? Or the Houston Texans&#39;? The Cleveland Browns don&#39;t even have a logo to speak of. (And they&#39;re also not brown.) But I guarantee you know which teams are TEN, HOU, and CLE. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p> And, importantly, these team initialisms are not represented by typography alone: they are in a box with the team&#39;s primary color. That use of color does all the branding work necessary, and does it more effectively, at small sizes or viewed from far distances, than the team logos. (One small niggle I have is that the team initialisms are big white letters but are outlined by the team&#39;s secondary color. If you look closely at my screen capture from yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl above, you&#39;ll see that “KC” is outlined in yellow and “PHI” in silver. This has the effect, at a normal viewing distance, of making the initialisms look a little fuzzy. The secondary color outlines are too subtle to have their intended effect of further branding the teams, and instead have the unintended effect of making the text look poorly rendered on screen. I bet Fox tweaks this by next year.)</p><p> The elimination of all needless chrome is arguably the most striking change of all, because Fox&#39;s old scorebug had the most chrome with the most superfluous “3D” styling and textures. This isn&#39;t minimalism, per se, but it&#39;s a strike against needless decoration — reminiscent to my mind of Jony Ive&#39;s radical redesign of iOS 7 a decade ago. Elements that can be conveyed by type and color alone <em>are</em> expressed by type and color alone.</p><p> Other noteworthy features:</p><ul><li><p> <em>Timeouts remaining</em> : Prominent but not distracting. Seeing how many timeouts a team has remaining was a huge problem with Fox&#39;s old scorebug, and with most other networks&#39; current scorebugs. (Remaining timeouts are very important in close football games.)</p></li><li><p> <em>Current down and yards to go indicator (eg “1st &amp; 10”)</em> : Placement atop the team initialism conveys which team has the ball. Fox&#39;s old scorebug did have a “possession” indicator, but scroll back up to look at it, and see how long it takes you to figure out what it is. I&#39;ll put the answer in a footnote. <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p> <em>Typography</em> : Classic, legible, bold, timeless. It is also very “Fox” — the C in “KC” looks like the O in the classic “FOX” wordmark, and the zero (a digit Chiefs fans became very familiar with until the final seconds of the third quarter, because that&#39;s how many points they&#39;d scored until then — the Eagles cycled through a bunch of different digits en route to taking a 34-0 lead) looks pretty much exactly like the uppercase o in “FOX”.</p></li></ul><p> Bigger and bolder typography adds clarity. But removing the background chrome lets viewers “see through” to any game action that happens at the bottom of the screen. To me, after just one game, the old Fox scorebug looks hopelessly dated; old-fashioned without any nostalgic charm. If anything, the new typography-first design is the one that looks timeless, evocative of the graphics from classic NFL Films productions.</p><hr /><p>这是什么。 NFL broadcasts didn&#39;t always have scorebugs. I don&#39;t mean that they had smaller score indicators on screen. I mean they had none at all. This was true for all major sports on TV, not just football (eg the premise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">this gag from <em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a> ). Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials. But while the game played, there was no score on screen. Part of that is technology: game telecasts were low-fidelity over-the-air transmissions to relatively small TV screens that were viewed from across the room. Go back far enough and there wasn&#39;t even color. But a bigger aspect is inertia. Not showing the score at all times was the way games were always broadcast, so it was the way they were still broadcast.</p><p> Then came Fox.</p><p> For decades, there were three major TV networks in the US: ABC, NBC, and CBS. CBS had the Sunday game rights to the superior National Football Conference. “Superior” for the related reasons of team popularity <em>and</em> <a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">team market size</a> , which matters for ratings. Chicago, Philly, Washington, Dallas, Frisco. NBC had the Sunday game rights for the American Football Conference with teams from generally smaller cities. Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Miami. Good teams, but smaller cities. (In 1993, though, NFC teams had won 9 consecutive Super Bowls.)</p><p> Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox network was an attempt — soon enough proven successful — to establish a fourth US network. At the time of their debut in 1987, Fox only had prime time programming on one night a week (Sundays, conveniently). In 1993 Murdoch and Fox upended the world of sports broadcasting by outbidding (stupid, tightfisted, hubristic) CBS for the rights to broadcast the NFC games on Sundays.</p><p> In 2018, Bryan Curtis published at The Ringer a comprehensive oral history of the deal and its consequences: “ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever</a> ”. If this sort of thing interests you at all, read that. It&#39;s a great story, well told.</p><p> But so in 1994 Fox took over the NFC broadcasts. They poached from CBS all the announcers, cameramen, directors, and producers. (CBS didn&#39;t need them anymore, because they had no football games to broadcast.) But while the voices announcing the game were familiar (including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">the best duo ever to do it</a> : John Madden and Pat Summerall), the look and feel of the broadcasts was intentionally new and fresh and, well, because it was Fox, brash. This included an innovation they called the “Fox Box”. Quoting from Curtis&#39;s oral history at The Ringer:</p><blockquote><p> <em>David Hill&#39;s most controversial idea about the NFL was his simplest: He thought the score and clock should have a permanent home on the screen — a feature that became known as the “Fox Box.” A noisy group of critics and rival executives thought the Fox Box was a terrible idea. It would clutter the screen and drive people away from blowouts. But Hill was convinced, because he&#39;d created a proto–Fox Box after a frustrating afternoon watching soccer in the UK</em></p><p> <strong>Hill:</strong> We&#39;d been out walking our dogs. We&#39;d come in, got a cup of tea, and switched the BBC on. I watched the game for a good 15 minutes. I don&#39;t know what the score is. I&#39;m thinking to myself, “Shit, I&#39;d really like to know what the score is.” So I thought, “That&#39;s easy. On a chyron, I&#39;ll just put it up in the corner.”所以我做到了。</p><p> <strong>Madden:</strong> Instead of saying, “No, that&#39;s a stupid idea, we got other things we have to do,” he said, “If the score and the time is the most important thing, why don&#39;t we just put it up and leave it there?” That&#39;s where the Fox Box came from. That was David Hill.</p><p> <strong>Dolgin:</strong> All the networks told us, “You&#39;re screwing this up. You&#39;re idiots to do this.”</p><p> <strong>Albert:</strong> The thought was, some networks won&#39;t leave the time and score up because it&#39;s a blowout and they didn&#39;t want you to <em>know</em> it&#39;s a blowout.</p></blockquote><p> The “Fox Box” idea wasn&#39;t just controversial, it was widely panned as stupid. The networks literally thought it would be better if many viewers didn&#39;t know the score. And when the Fox Box appeared, many critics agreed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">Dan Cox&#39;s review of Fox&#39;s opening week broadcast for Variety</a> , in September 1994:</p><blockquote><p> The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game. Fox Sports prexy David Hill has said it&#39;s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.</p><p>好吧，是的。 But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p></blockquote><p> Who seems stupid now? Imagine the outcry if Fox had broadcast yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl without any scorebug at all — you know, for those who would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business. Smokers want to smoke and would stay home if they couldn&#39;t, the argument went. Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better. But better necessarily implies different.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-10"><p> You know how when you&#39;re watching most TV channels — not just sports, but any sort of show at all — they keep a logo for the channel in one of the corners of the screen? Those omnipresent logos are called <em>bugs</em> (perhaps because everyone knows they&#39;re slightly annoying?). Hence: scorebug for an always-present score indicator. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-10"><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF Style Guide</a> has no entry for “Roman numerals” because no obscenities or expletives are strong enough to convey the policy. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-10"><p> The one matchup this design might not work great for would be a Rams-Chargers game, because in addition to sharing a city (and stadium), they even share the same team colors: blue and yellow.

It&#39;s solvable — <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrbiggs.bsky.social/post/3lhvsptivlk2z">here are some examples with different color treatments</a> from a similar scorebug for the English Premier League.
