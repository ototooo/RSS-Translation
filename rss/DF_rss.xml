<p>Mark Wilson 在四月份为 Fast Company 撰写的一篇简介中介绍了 LoveFrom Serif 的创建，这是一个新的字体系列，由苹果非凡的 San Francisco 系列背后的许多设计师设计：</p><blockquote><p> Serifs（想想 Times New Roman）反而成为焦点，经过详尽的搜索后，LoveFrom 设计师 Antonio Cavedoni 将巴斯克维尔作为灵感来源。这种字体是每个人都见过的，所以它会很熟悉，甚至是永恒的。但它有足够的表达成分，可以存在于许多环境中。同样具有巨大吸引力的是约翰·巴斯克维尔本人的历史背景。</p><p> “约翰·巴斯克维尔作为一个人，作为一个工匠，他的痴迷和性格与我们这些 LoveFrom 的人惊人地相似，”艾夫说。 “这确实以一种非常自然的方式成为了开发我们自己的字体的起点。”</p><p>卡维多尼解释说，巴斯克维尔确实很着迷。正如我们在<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90693444/jony-ives-first-major-design-since-leaving-apple-isnt-what-youd-expect">《大地宪章》的</a>故事中所写，巴斯克维尔首先通过“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanning">日本</a>”漆器物品赚钱。当他 40 多岁的时候，他有足够的资源去专注于他对文字创作的热情。作为一名训练有素的书法家，他希望提高书籍印刷的质量。他不仅着迷于巴斯克维尔字体的设计，还着迷于各个金属“冲孔”的精心制作，这些金属“冲孔”压紧每个字母以确保印刷清晰。他甚至<a href="https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1761.htm">配制了</a>一种改进的墨水，并了解到他可以将编织纸放入热黄铜圆筒中，使其具有光泽。</p></blockquote><p>一位致力于墨水配方和纸张整理创新的字体设计师——是的，这听起来像是艾维和他的同事们志同道合的想法。</p><p>毫不奇怪，史蒂夫·乔布斯的<em>《Make Something Wonderful》</em>的全部内容（无论是网络版还是限量印刷版）都是在 LoveFrom 中排版的。在此之前，我只遇到过小剂量的 LoveFrom Serif，并且通常是在显示尺寸（如<a href="https://www.lovefrom.com/">LoveFrom 网站的主页</a>）。事实证明，作为长文本界面，它非常好——传统但独特。一般来说，大多数人认为衬线字体更正式，无衬线字体更休闲。 LoveFrom Serif 感觉像是一种友好、情感温暖的衬线，但在形式和结构上没有放弃任何基础。当然是英国人，但不知何故带有一丝加州的欢迎气息。它显然源自 Baskerville，但与 Apple 平台上<a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/">的</a>同名 Baskerville 相比，它给人一种不同的感觉，特别是在文本大小方面。</p><p>卡维多尼本周在旧金山主要公共图书馆发表了题为“<a href="https://letterformarchive.org/shop/unexpected-baskerville-the-story-of-lovefrom-serif/">意外的巴斯克维尔：塞里夫之爱的故事</a>”的演讲。令我痛苦的是错过了一场<a href="https://typo.social/@typographica/110630124570983807">看似</a>精彩的演讲，有杰出的嘉宾和历史书籍，但视频录制即将于“今年晚些时候”推出。</p><p><strong>后记：</strong>我已经在这个链接上坐了几个星期了，部分原因是，好吧，我这样做，但也因为我想让阅读<em>《Make Something Wonderful》</em>的体验安定下来。对我来说，那本书是《LoveFrom》 Serif 真正的首次亮相。如果你想练习一种字体，可以在里面放一本书。在这段时间里，我多次想到<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen">我是多么想念迪恩·艾伦</a>，特别是在此，我渴望他对字体和这本书的想法。无数次重读迪恩的《 <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103090824/http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=7">二十张脸》</a></em> ，这是一本非常<a href="https://twitter.com/verbosus/status/954452524379131904">简洁和引人注目</a>的“可用文本字体的调查”，我想起他在 ITC 巴斯克维尔的条目也指向<a href="https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves">伊夫斯夫人</a>，祖扎娜·利科在 1996 年的复兴（有那么长吗？我将永远认为《Mrs Eaves》字体是一种“新”字体），迪恩这样描述它：“通过模仿凸版印刷文本中不可预测的形式来复兴巴斯克维尔，这是一项有趣但矫揉造作的实验。”</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“LoveFrom Serif”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/lovefrom-serif">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/apple_silo_twitter" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwb" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40043</id><published> 2023-06-28T22:40:39Z</published><updated> 2023-06-29T23:40:13Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">很难不认为 Twitter 失去了优质品牌广告商，并希望快速进军长视频内容，从这种“筒仓”促销中获得的收益比苹果从新发现的观众中获得的收益还要多。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1673730750095712256">Apple TV，昨天在 Twitter 上</a>：</p><blockquote><p>距离 #Silo 大结局还有 3 天。</p><p>这是第一集的全部内容。</p></blockquote><p>嵌入在该推广推文中的是整个系列的首映。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-28"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-28">1</a></sup></p><p>就本段而言，抛开围绕 Twitter 的政治，这是一个相当有趣的促销举措。您可以在 Apple TV 应用中免费观看所有 Apple TV+ 原创剧集的首播剧集： <em>《Silo</em> 》、 <em>《Ted Lasso》</em> 、 <em>《Severance</em> 》、 <em>《The Morning Show》</em> 、 <em>《Hijack</em> 》（伊德里斯·艾尔巴主演的新惊悚片）——所有这些。这是一个显而易见的策略：即使只看其中一部首播，每月只需花费 7 美元即可观看其余节目。任何流媒体服务的最大障碍就是让人们<em>尝试</em>它。每个拥有 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 的人都已经安装了 Apple 的 TV 应用程序，而且很多人的电视或机顶盒上都已经安装了该应用程序。但苹果并没有从 Twitter 链接到 TV+ 应用程序——他们直接在 Twitter 上分享了整个剧集。不是 YouTube，不是 Facebook。推特。 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/twitter-now-allows-paid-users-to-upload-two-hour-long-videos/">直到上个月，</a>这在技术上还是不可能的。</p><p>但今天要求任何人抛开推特的政治有点像旧的“<em>但除此之外，你觉得这部剧怎么样，林肯夫人？”</em> “ 玩笑。 Twitter 上有一位排名第一的用户，这个用户就是埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk)，随着时间的推移，他的政治和政策的<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4061600-musk-says-cis-cisgender-considered-slurs-on-twitter/">毒性越来越大</a>，而不是越来越小。广告从根本上来说是为了吸引受众而付费，而不是对内容的认可，但在某种程度上它是一种合作伙伴关系。出版商和平台拒绝令人反感的广告，广告商则避开令人反感的平台。 Apple 与 Twitter 的界限在哪里？</p><p>不出所料，马斯克似乎对苹果的<em>Silo</em>促销活动<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1673831774038949888">感到兴奋</a>，其中包括自定义的<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/wwdc-2023-hashflag/">hashflag</a>图标。与 MrBeast 一样有影响力的人吉米·唐纳森 (Jimmy Donaldson)<a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1673850123967770624">回复马斯克</a>：“确实是明智之举，我从来没有听说过这个节目，现在我正在观看第一集并投资，哈哈。”如果你想知道为什么苹果会<em>考虑</em>继续在 Twitter 上做广告，答案是：该平台仍然具有巨大的影响力。</p><p>苹果公司在多种媒体上投入了大量的广告费用。但我唯一看到有人问“苹果为什么<em>在那里</em>做广告？”的地方。是推特。很难不认为，Twitter 失去了优质品牌广告商，并希望快速进军长格式视频内容，从这种<em>筒仓</em>促销中获得的收益比苹果从新发现的观众中获得的收益还要多。重要的不是钱（马斯克有很多钱），而是声望（大多数人认为推特已经破产了）。声望是买不来的，苹果公司选择通过这次促销活动在 Twitter 上给予一些声望。苹果继续在 Twitter 上打广告是否<em>令人愤慨</em>？我拒绝。但他们的选择让人感觉有点奇怪，而且有点好奇。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-28"><p>几周前我开始看<em>Silo</em> ，我非常喜欢它。第一季做得很好，每周都会揭示更多的整体谜团，同时一路上给出一些答案。强大的前提，良好的演员阵容，良好的制作价值。这不是<em>遣散费</em>，但确实很好。 （我对<em>《基金会》</em>也有同样的感觉，但我更喜欢<em>《筒仓》</em> 。）这是一部好剧，我很高兴它<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/silo-renewed-season-2-apple-1235643158/">已经续订了第二季</a>。在某个平行宇宙中， <em>《筒仓》</em>是 Netflix 上的<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80214497">一部剧</a>，本来会有更多人观看，但它<a href="https://www.theonion.com/netflix-condemns-wga-strike-for-putting-future-show-can-1850395744">仍然会被取消</a>。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-06-28"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 在第一季大结局之前，Apple 在 Twitter 上免费提供了《Silo》的整个第一集</title></entry><entry><title>Ron Amadeo 的 Pixel Fold 持续了四天</title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/rip-to-my-pixel-fold-dead-after-four-days/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwa" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/amadeo-pixel-fold" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40042</id><published> 2023-06-27T01:22:48Z</published><updated> 2023-06-27T01:23:09Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>艾莉森·约翰逊（Allison Johnson）为 The Verge 撰文：</p><blockquote><p>谷歌已经优化了一系列自己的应用程序，使其能够在 Fold 的展开平板电脑模式下运行，而且它们非常棒。 Gmail、YouTube、照片——它们都通过将信息放在侧边栏和垂直列中来利用全屏。 Chrome 具有类似桌面的界面，窗口顶部有选项卡，并且能够加载网站的完整版本。当我将手机设置为 L 形时，Google Meet 很容易将与会者的平铺视图移动到屏幕的顶部，并将控件滑动到显示屏的下半部分。我不需要摆弄任何东西——它就起作用了。</p><p>不过，许多第三方应用程序并没有利用整个内部屏幕，这很糟糕。 Instagram 只是一款手机大小的应用程序，两侧都有黑条。 Twitter、Facebook Messenger，甚至谷歌旗下的 Fitbit 也是如此。你可以双击两侧的空白区域来快速将应用程序滑动到左侧、右侧或中间，这很好。 TikTok 在屏幕中间播放垂直视频，但至少利用两侧的额外空间将通常位于视频顶部的所有文本移开。即便如此，当您不观看视频或执行多任务时，感觉还是浪费了很多空间。</p></blockquote><p>这种外形似乎<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">比翻盖手机</a>对我更有吸引力，但我对 iPhone 这边的人并没有一丝嫉妒。谷歌已经对自己的许多 Android 应用程序进行了调整，以完全拥抱平板电脑大小的折叠式屏幕，这很好，但如果您最常使用的大多数第三方应用程序不这样做，那么讨论似乎就结束了，对吧那里。</p><p>这是一个典型的先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题：第三方开发商不会花时间去拥抱这些可折叠屏幕，除非有很多手机都在使用它们，但在得到广泛支持之前用户不太可能购买它们对于他们最常使用的应用程序。如果这是一个很棒的外形，那么谷歌应该支持它，并宣称可折叠屏幕是 Android 的未来，或者至少是 Pixel 手机的未来。否则这一切看起来都是浪费时间。</p><p>我重申一下，另一个问题是案例。绝大多数人将手机放在保护壳中。手机越贵，人们就越有可能需要用手机壳来“保护”它。这款手机的 256 GB 存储空间起价为 1,800 美元，512 GB 存储空间售价为 1,919 美元。 （相同容量的 iPhone 14 Pro 售价为 1,200 美元/1,400 美元。）但可折叠手机不能放入保护壳中。他们的目标是利基中的利基中的利基——人们愿意花 1,800 美元购买带有可折叠显示屏、不使用保护壳的手机。</p><p><strong>更新：</strong>事实证明，Pixel Fold<em>有</em>一些保护套：<a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_fold_case?hl=en-US">一款来自 Google 的 60 美元硅胶保护套</a>，以及一款<a href="https://bellroy.com/products/leather-case-for-pixel-fold">来自 Bellroy 的“即将推出”的皮革保护套</a>。<strong>另一个更新：</strong><a href="https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel-fold-case-collection">来自 Spigen 的一些案例</a>，起价 60 美元，以及<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-google-pixel-fold-cases/">来自 Android Police 的其他案例的集合</a>。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Allison Johnson 评测价值 1,800 美元的 Google Pixel Fold”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/pixel-fold-review">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> 《人工智能工厂内部：让技术变得人性化的人类》 </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/inside-the-ai-factory" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40037</id><published> 2023-06-26T21:02:52Z</published><updated> 2023-06-26T21:10:52Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Neil Long 在 Mobilegamer.biz 上撰文，对 Phillip Shoemaker 进行了一次有趣的采访，后者曾于 2009 年至 2016 年在 Apple 负责 App Store 审核：</p><blockquote><p>苹果的应用程序审查流程对于移动游戏制造商来说仍然是一个大问题，因为他们需要遵循模糊的指导方针和不一致的裁决。因此，我们询问了 Shoemaker 对于苹果如何解决这个问题的想法：</p><p> “解决这种不一致的方法——我不想这么说——是：让我们借鉴谷歌的经验，”他告诉我们。 “尤其是现在有了人工智能工具。你大概可以完成审核团队 80% 的工作。”</p></blockquote><p>在应用商店时代，很明显，苹果的<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/03/teabot-data-steal-google-play/">恶意软件泄露问题</a>比<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-password-stealing-malware-infects-100-000-google-play-users/">谷歌的</a>要少。据我所知，没有哪个 iOS 开发者不认为 App Store（尤其是审核）可以而且应该在很多方面进行改进。但“<em>让它更像 Play 商店</em>”和“<em>使用人工智能进行审核</em>”对我来说听起来都不对。</p><p>此外，自 Shoemaker 于 2016 年离开 Apple 以来，App Store 审核时间已从平均约 5 天减少到 1 天。（我的理解是，新的自动化工具是流程改进的重要组成部分。Shoemaker 对 App Store 审核的抱怨似乎停留在2016年。）</p><blockquote><p>与苹果高级副总裁 Eddy Cue、Greg &#39;Joz&#39; Joswiak 和 App Store 副总裁 Matt Fischer 相比，席勒似乎是最后一个坚持自动化应用审核的人。 “我认为从根本上改进 App Store 的方法是让 Phil 成为 Apple 员工，让他不再涉足 App Store，”Shoemaker 说。 “这才是他们真正需要做的。艾迪更进步，乔兹更进步，我们知道马特也是如此。菲尔只需要把他的肉爪子从 App Store 上撤下来就可以了。”</p><p> “如果菲尔不退后一步，法院绝对会做出改变，”舒梅克继续说道。</p></blockquote><p>如果我在苹果公司工作，我会打印一个“Meaty Paws”标志并将其贴在席勒的门上。</p><blockquote><p> “菲尔需要退后一步，我认为这是主要的事情——需要新鲜血液加入并做出一些改变，因为降低价格和开放指导方针以允许新的有趣的事物将是至关重要的。”</p></blockquote><p>当然，菲尔·席勒 (Phil Schiller) 就是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">在 2011 年的一份备忘录中建议降低苹果公司佣金的</a>高管。</p><blockquote><p> “为菲尔工作很艰难……他是那些喜欢侮辱别人的人之一，对吧？我的意思是他没有界限——他会侮辱你的孩子，你会想：‘我为什么又在这家公司工作？’”</p><p>舒梅克会定期从他的孩子那里获取有关应用程序和游戏的反馈，并在 ERB 会议中使用这些反馈。 “菲尔会说，哦，这样说真是愚蠢，你的孩子有那么笨吗？你就像，你在开玩笑吗？</p></blockquote><p>看来两个菲尔斯相处得并不好。 Shoemaker 也没有透露<a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/apple-fart-apps/">iWiz 是否会重返 App Store</a> 。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“前应用商店审核主管 Phillip Shoemaker 似乎对 Phil Schiller 有一种奇怪的个人恩怨”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/shoemaker-schiller">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>为什么乳齿象的采用停滞不前？ </title><link href="https://blog.bloonface.com/2023/06/12/why-did-the-twittermigration-fail/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw1" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40033</id><published> 2023-06-23T19:05:11Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T19:05:12Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Ben Lang 在《Road to VR》中撰文：</p><blockquote><p> In a somewhat surprising move, Apple confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will support WebXR. Prior to the reveal of the headset, it was an open question whether the company would entertain the idea of XR experiences through the browser, and even more so if the company would adopt the relatively new <a href="https://immersiveweb.dev/">WebXR standard</a> . But now Apple has confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will indeed support WebXR.</p><p> The company confirmed as much in its WWDC 2023 developer talk titled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10279/">Meet Safari for Spatial Computing</a> , in which Apple explained the version of Safari running on Vision Pro “truly is Safari with the same WebKit engine underneath, plus some thoughtful additions for [Vision Pro].”</p><p> Thanks to Safari on visionOS being a fully-featured version of the browser, existing websites should work exactly as expected, the company says.

<p>Ian Betteridge:</p><blockquote><p> What defines Mastodon is not the use of a protocol. The protocol is just an enabler. Instead, Mastodon is defined by allowing communities (instances) freedom of association. <em>It is the ability of communities to choose not to federate with anyone else which gives Mastodon its strength.</em></p></blockquote><p> His whole post is thoughtful and considered, and worth your attention. Betteridge largely disagrees with me on this issue, and while he hasn&#39;t changed my mind, I&#39;m happy to direct your attention to his arguments.</p><p> But I do disagree with this:</p><blockquote><p> If you want to understand why some communities are wary of Meta, it&#39;s worth remembering how ActivityPub works. Let&#39;s say I run an instance called EvilMole.social. If I don&#39;t defederate (block) Meta&#39;s server, any user on their server and any user on EvilMole can follow each other. So suppose that @molesworth@evilmole.social follows @billy@meta.social. What happens?</p><p> First, every single one of Molesworth&#39;s posts are now available to Meta, including <em>all</em> the replies they make to everyone <em>including people who don&#39;t follow anyone on Meta&#39;s server</em> . In other words, Meta gets access to posts from people who may very well have an issue with that.</p></blockquote><p> If you don&#39;t want Meta (or Google, or whoever) to see your posts, then no matter which instance you&#39;re on, and which other servers your instance chooses to federate with, you need to make your account private. If you&#39;re posting publicly on any Mastodon server, everything you post is visible to the world, including Meta. If your account isn&#39;t private, you&#39;re posting to the open web.

It was carrying a pilot and four passengers, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush. [...]</p><p> “It seems like this submersible has some elements of MacGyvery jerry-rigged-ness. You are putting construction pipes as ballast,” Pogue said to Rush in an interview.</p><p> “I don&#39;t know if I would use that description,” Rush replied. He added that the OceanGate worked with Boeing and Nasa on the pressure vessel. “Everything else can fail. Your thrusters can go, your lights can go, you&#39;re still going to be safe.”</p><p> Pogue said he was nervous before boarding and revealed some of the contents of the waiver form he was required to sign.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced the availability of new software tools and technologies that enable developers to create groundbreaking app experiences for <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> — Apple&#39;s first spatial computer. Featuring visionOS, the world&#39;s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in their physical space using the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — their eyes, hands, and voice. [...] With the visionOS SDK, developers can utilize the powerful and unique capabilities of Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences across a variety of categories including productivity, design, gaming, and more.</p><p> Next month, Apple will open developer labs in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo to provide developers with hands-on experience to test their apps on Apple Vision Pro hardware and get support from Apple engineers. Development teams will also be able to apply for developer kits to help them quickly build, iterate, and test right on Apple Vision Pro.</p></blockquote><p> Three thoughts:</p><ul><li><p> This is the same SDK Apple itself is using to develop VisionOS apps. I mean, sure, Apple has access to private APIs, but that&#39;s true on MacOS and iOS too. But this is not like the original WatchKit in 2015, where third-party developers were stuck with a severely limited SDK that was nothing like the APIs being used by Apple itself for the built-in WatchOS apps. This is real dogfooding, and I bet we see some very strong apps and games for VisionOS on day one.</p></li><li><p> These in-person labs will prove essential for many developers during this prelude period, where developers won&#39;t have access to Vision Pro itself while working on apps.</p></li><li><p> I think Reality Composer Pro could be the sleeper hit of this SDK — a tool not (just) for programmers, but for creative artists. Like what Adobe Illustrator was to graphic design vs. writing Postscript code at the outset of the desktop publishing revolution a generation ago.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘VisionOS SDK Is Now Available’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/visionos-sdk-now-available">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro: I-95 Will Re-Open This Weekend </title><link href="https://twitter.com/governorshapiro/status/1671240085147189249?s=61&amp;t=DcLHtJxGvAJFHF3OQBwFVA" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvr" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/i95-reopening" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40023</id><published> 2023-06-21T21:17:30Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T21:21:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

So the best advice I can give if you&#39;re concerned about your data, is lock down your account and don&#39;t post publicly.</p><p> All that being said, here&#39;s what we plan to do <em>if</em> this thing ever sees the light of day:</p><ul><li> As a team, we will review what the service is capable of and what advantages/disadvantages such a service will bring to the Fediverse</li><li> We will then make a determination on whether we will defederate that service</li><li> We will <em>NOT</em> jump on the bandwagon, or partake in the rumour mill that seems to be plaguing the Fediverse at the moment</li></ul><p> It&#39;s important to say that neither myself or Mike like anything that Facebook stands for.

<p>Mike Masnick, back in 2019:</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve argued for years that while many people like to say that content moderation is <em>difficult</em> , that&#39;s misleading. Content moderation at scale <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=content+moderation+at+scale">is impossible to do well</a> . Importantly, this is <em>not</em> an argument that we should throw up our hands and do nothing. Nor is it an argument that companies can&#39;t do <em>better jobs</em> within their own content moderation efforts. But I do think there&#39;s a huge problem in that many people — including many politicians and journalists — seem to expect that these companies not only can, but should, strive for a level of content moderation that is simply impossible to reach.</p><p> And thus, throwing humility to the wind, I&#39;d like to propose Masnick&#39;s Impossibility Theorem, as a sort of play on Arrow&#39;s Impossibility Theorem. <em>Content moderation at scale is impossible to do well</em> . More specifically, it will always end up frustrating very large segments of the population and will always fail to accurately represent the “proper” level of moderation of anyone.

But a lot might. And “just sign in using your existing Instagram identity” is a powerful enticement. If you already have an Instagram account, you&#39;ll be able to jump right in. How to get started with Mastodon (or any of the other ActivityPub “Fediverse” platforms) has been an enormous obstacle to adoption. People find it confusing, and people don&#39;t like being confused. “Just use your Instagram identity” is not confusing at all.</p><p> I think there are a lot of long-time Mastodon users who <em>like</em> the fact that it isn&#39;t gaining mainstream traction, and want to keep it that way. But then don&#39;t call it “open”.</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110573756551776352">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s a weird own goal for various Mastodon admins who are running a decentralized social network based on interoperable protocols to pledge that they won&#39;t interoperate with services from existing social networks if built on the same open protocols.</p><p> It&#39;s not even the hypocrisy, it&#39;s just dumb and undermines the entire point of interoperable protocols.</p></blockquote><p> The hypocrisy irks me, but I think he&#39;s right that it&#39;s foolish too. The Mastodon server admins who are preemptively promising to defederate Threads are effectively guaranteeing that users on their instances will be isolated from a potential majority of users on the overall platform.</p><p> <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/19.html">Dave Winer, at Scripting News</a> :</p><blockquote><p> They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is — who&#39;s being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn&#39;t mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn&#39;t one of them. You have to <em>think</em> .</p><p> But here&#39;s some good news. There&#39;s no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it&#39;s probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is “really simple” and the benefit of federation is well known <em>to users</em> . That&#39;s been what&#39;s kept it from being pwned by bigco&#39;s all these years.</p></blockquote><p> I cited email as an example yesterday of big companies running big instances and not extinguishing the openness that made the platform great. Podcasting is maybe an even better example. I don&#39;t take podcasting&#39;s future for granted, but 20 years in, it&#39;s still thriving as an open medium, despite the presence of titanic players like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify. Ultimately the involvement of these big companies has made <em>open</em> podcasting far more popular and enduring than I ever would have imagined 20 years ago, because they brought podcasting to the mass market. And there are some roles that we need big centralized players to play even on an open platform. Apple&#39;s iTunes podcast directory, for example. Facebook&#39;s Threads app could be something akin to Apple Podcasts for Mastodon.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TNLNYC/110576140169004056">Tristan Louis</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The anti-Meta #Fedipact can only achieve one thing: make sure that #ActivityPub loses to the Bluesky protocol. Is that what people here want?</p><p> As an #openweb advocate, I don&#39;t.</p><p> Meta joining the Fediverse is like AOL joining the internet: something that will bring a mass amount of people in, create some friction, but ultimately make the net better as more people federating on #Mastodon, #kbin, #lemmy, #pixelfed and other parts of the Fediverse make open protocols that much stronger.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a> and <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> are to Reddit what Mastodon is to Twitter. Unsurprisingly, they&#39;re <a href="https://kbin.fediverse.observer/stats">both</a> <a href="https://lemmy.fediverse.observer/stats">seeing</a> an infusion of new users this month, but are both still tiny compared to Reddit.</p><p> One controversial aspect to this story is that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384207">Meta apparently invited the admins from several top Mastodon instances to brief them on their plans</a> , under NDA. <a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/110573363201929310">Tim Bray</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My take:</p><ol><li> The Fedi folks shouldn&#39;t have taken the NDA&#39;d meeting. Transparency is essential.</li><li> It is not reasonable to expect ethical behaviour from Meta. It should be assumed that that if they can profit by disemboweling the Fediverse, they will.</li><li> There is an opportunity to attract some of the ordinary decent humans on Meta because they don&#39;t know anything better exists.</li></ol><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t de-federate. But only by about 51/49.</p></blockquote><p> Of course such a meeting would be under NDA, for now. It&#39;s an unreleased and as-yet unannounced product. Meeting with Facebook under NDA isn&#39;t ipso facto wrong — although I do think the fact that they were invited shouldn&#39;t itself be part of the NDA. Transparency is essential, but transparency can come after Threads is actually announced. The idea that NDAs are inherently nefarious is just conspirational tinfoil-hat nonsense. (Tinfoil hat nonsense is, alas, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470">having a moment</a> .)</p><p> On point 2, I&#39;m fine with starting Facebook with two strikes against it. Put them on a short leash. They start fucking around, Mastodon instances should start de-federating from their product. I just don&#39;t see why they should be blocked preemptively. The whole point of an open protocol like ActivityPub is that no one can own it. I&#39;ll close this post with the same question I did <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">yesterday</a> : Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer. Others clearly disagree.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ More on Preemptively Blocking Facebook&#39;s Imminent ActivityPub Entry</title></entry><entry><title> Regulation for Thee, but Not for Me </title><link href="https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvm" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40018</id><published> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Billy Perrigo, reporting for Time:</p><blockquote><p> The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, has spent the last month touring world capitals where, at talks to sold-out crowds and in meetings with heads of governments, he has repeatedly spoken of the need for global AI regulation.</p><p> But behind the scenes, OpenAI has lobbied for significant elements of the most comprehensive AI legislation in the world — the EU&#39;s AI Act — to be watered down in ways that would reduce the regulatory burden on the company, according to documents about OpenAI&#39;s engagement with EU officials obtained by Time from the European Commission via freedom of information requests.</p></blockquote><p> I think concerns about the current state of AI are overwrought, and that regulation is not called for. But what Altman seems to be pushing for isn&#39;t a hands-off approach from regulators — instead he just wants it enshrined in law that OpenAI and only OpenAI is exempt from regulations.</p><p> A very interesting and cogent paper leaked out of Google a few weeks ago, with the title “ <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">We Have No Moat, and Neither Does OpenAI</a> ”. The basic argument in the paper is that open-source AI will outcompete Google and OpenAI&#39;s proprietary approaches. Ever since I read this leaked paper, it&#39;s seemed clear to me that Sam Altman believes this as well, and so he&#39;s been devoted to creating a <em>regulatory</em> moat to protect OpenAI.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Regulation for Thee, but Not for Me’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><link href="https://l.kolide.co/3JWbXEv" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw2" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/06/kolide_zero_trust_for_okta_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40034</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-06-20T23:55:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T23:56:06Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#39;s an uncomfortable fact: at most companies, employees can download sensitive company data onto any device, keep it there forever, and never even know that they&#39;re doing something wrong.</p><p> Kolide&#39;s new report, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3I7025A">The State of Sensitive Data</a> , shines a light on an area of security that is often ignored, but is nevertheless a massive hole in many companies&#39; Zero Trust fortress. </p><p><img

  alt="Study results showing that companies have poor policies for requiring user authentication to access sensitive data (65%); prohibiting downloading sensitive data onto personal devices (46%); ensuring plain-text access credentions are not stored on employee devices (38%); setting a specified time period sensitive data can reside on an employee device (16%)."
/></p><p> These findings are particularly alarming given the overall state of device security. IT teams routinely struggle to enforce timely OS updates and patch management, meaning that end users are storing your most sensitive data–things like customer records, confidential IP, and plain-text access credentials–on devices that are vulnerable to attack.</p><p> This problem has gone unaddressed because until now there hasn&#39;t been a good solution for it. <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3lch4WK">MDM solutions are too blunt an instrument</a> for dealing with sensitive data, and <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3DTTpRA">DLP tools are too extreme and invasive</a> for most companies. After all, you&#39;re not trying to ban downloads together, nor regard every download as suspicious. You&#39;re just trying to make sure employees aren&#39;t keeping data for longer than they need or keeping it on an unmanaged or un-secure device.</p><p> Kolide offers a more nuanced approach to setting and enforcing sensitive data policies.</p><p> <em>Our premise is simple: if an employee&#39;s device is out of compliance, it can&#39;t access your apps.</em></p><p> Kolide lets admins run queries to detect sensitive data, flag devices that have violated policies, and enforce OS and browser updates so vulnerable devices aren&#39;t accessing data.</p><p> Our unique approach makes device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn&#39;t compliant, users can&#39;t log in to their cloud apps until they&#39;ve fixed the problem. But instead of creating more work for IT, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.</p><p> To learn more and see our product in action, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3XlSqAq">visit kolide.com</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Zero Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/06/kolide_zero_trust_for_okta_1">★</a></div> ]]>;</content><title> [Sponsor] Kolide — Zero Trust for Okta</title></entry><entry><title> On Scanning QR Codes With Your iPhone </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/qr-code-scanning-easier-ios-17/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40017</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:52:13Z</published><updated> 2023-06-27T02:29:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick, on a tweaked feature in iOS 17 beta 1:</p><blockquote><p> Apple in iOS 13 decided to redesign QR code scanning so that the link appeared as a yellow button within the camera viewfinder itself. However, in doing so, it created a new problem: The button would rove around in the viewfinder if the camera lens was also in motion, which made tapping it even more tricky than before.</p><p> Thankfully, in iOS 17, Apple has made another small, and this time welcome, change that improves the situation immeasurably. Now when you scan a QR code, the link button automatically appears at the bottom of the Camera interface. So instead of chasing the dancing link around the viewfinder, you can simply tap its fixed location above the shutter button.</p></blockquote><p> My tip for scanning QR codes is not to use the Camera app at all. Instead, enable iOS&#39;s hidden built-in Code Scanner app in Contol Center. Go to Settings → Control Center, and under More Controls, enable Code Scanner. (This is also a good reminder that you can disable Control Center items you seldom use.) Now when you encounter a QR code, just pull down Control Center and use the Code Scanner app.</p><p> Worth keeping in mind, too, that when you use the regular Camera app to scan a QR code, if you open the link, it opens in Safari. With the Code Scanner app in Control Center, links open in a sandboxed in-app web view, which is more private. The only downside is that if you want to keep the opened page around, you&#39;ll need to open it in Safari from within Code Scanner.</p><p> Code Scanner is a fantastic little “do one thing and do it well” app, but because you can only get to it via Control Center but it&#39;s not shown in Control Center by default, most people don&#39;t even know it exists. It&#39;s truly a hidden gem.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out you can also launch the Code Scanner app <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/code-scanner-via-search.jpeg">by searching for it on the iOS home screen</a> . Also, you can tell Siri “scan a QR code” or “open QR Code Scanner” and it&#39;ll open.好的！</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘On Scanning QR Codes With Your iPhone’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Not That Kind of &#39;Open&#39; </title><link href="https://fedipact.online/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40016</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:27:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-19T23:08:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The Anti-Meta Fedi Pact:</p><blockquote><p> “i am an instance admin/mod on the fediverse. by signing this pact, i hereby agree to block any instances owned by meta should they pop up on the fediverse. project92 is a real and serious threat to the health and longevity of fedi and must be fought back against at every possible opportunity”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jw4o5d45v22a">Yours truly, on Bluesky a month ago</a> (which, ironically, is not yet open itself, so <a href="https://skeeet.xyz/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jw4o5d45v22a">here&#39;s an open preview</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Masto zealots: We&#39;re open, federate with us!</p><p> Instagram: Great, we&#39;re building a new thing to join you.</p><p> Masto zealots: Not that kind of open!</p></blockquote><p> It should go without saying that I&#39;m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/facebook+criminal+enterprise">no fan of Meta/Facebook</a> . But the idea that administrators of Mastodon/Fediverse instances should pledge to preemptively block Facebook&#39;s imminent Twitter-like ActivityPub service ( <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">purportedly named Threads</a> ) strikes me as petty and deliberately insular. I don&#39;t like Facebook, the company, and I&#39;ve never seen the appeal of Facebook, the product (aka “the blue app”). But there are literally <em>billions</em> of good people who use their services. Why cut them off from the open ActivityPub social world? Large swaths of Mastodon seem to relish the fact that it&#39;s confusing how to get started, and that this confusion is keeping Mastodon small.</p><p> The whole point of ActivityPub as an open protocol is to turn Twitter/Instagram-like social networking into something more akin to email: truly open. If Facebook were on the cusp of launching a Gmail-like email service, would you preemptively declare that your email server would block them? To me that&#39;s what this “Anti-Meta Fedi Pact” <a href="https://g33ks.coffee/@tiesselune/110569596742983089">is arguing for</a> .</p><p> Maybe I&#39;m wrong! I certainly don&#39;t think the “ <em>let&#39;s pledge to block Facebook before their Fediverse thing even starts</em> ” people are nuts. But to me this feels like convicting Facebook of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">pre-crime</a> . Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer.

I went to check on it when I saw this news that Google Domains is shutting down, and I had an alert that the new domain name I registered would be put on “hold” <em>today</em> if I didn&#39;t verify the email address I used to register it. I hadn&#39;t seen any verification emails from Google about it. I told Google Domains to send another verification email. Still didn&#39;t see it. Turns out that even though I used an @gmail.com address to register the domain, every single email from Google Domains was being flagged as spam. So Google&#39;s own email service considers all emails from Google&#39;s own domain name service to be spam.</p><p> So, yeah, I&#39;d say Google needs to focus.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Domains Shutting Down, Assets Sold to Squarespace’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/16/google-domains">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jay Peters Interviews Reddit CEO Steve Huffman for The Verge </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762868/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvg" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/16/peters-huffman-interview" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40012</id><published> 2023-06-16T21:50:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-16T21:56:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Christina Warren, writing at Inverse:</p><blockquote><p> But buried in the keynote was a macOS feature that Apple <em>should</em> have called out with more fanfare: DirectX 12 support for macOS. As PC gamers already know, this software support means the floodgates are open for some <em>real</em> games — not that casual <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/what-the-car-first-impressions-triband-apple-arcade">Apple Arcade stuff</a> — on Mac. Maybe, just maybe, this is the beginning of the end to the old joke that Macs can&#39;t play AAA games. [...]</p><p> DirectX 12 support within the Game Porting Toolkit skips right over all of these translations. With zero need to modify any game code, games such as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> , <em>Diablo IV</em> , <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-review">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em> , and <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hogwarts-legacy-unforgivable">Hogwart&#39;s Legacy</a></em> can now run on Apple silicon Macs <em>almost</em> as if they&#39;re native.

<p>David Pierce for The Verge, “Every Smartphone Should Be a Flip Phone, Starting Right Now”:</p><blockquote><p> Okay, so I&#39;ve convinced you, right? Flip phones forever! Here&#39;s the problem: none of the flip phones currently on the market live up to this promise. There aren&#39;t even many to choose from. The Z Flip 4 gets a lot of things right, but it&#39;s held back by a too-small front screen and a just-fine camera setup. The new Razr Plus looks really promising, particularly because of its larger front screen, though its processor and durability ratings aren&#39;t particularly impressive. It also gets the software wrong, I think; letting me run full apps on the front screen isn&#39;t just silly — it runs against the whole appeal of a flip phone.</p><p> What we need is competition. That&#39;s going to take the rest of the smartphone world, from Apple and Google to Huawei and Oppo to Nothing and OnePlus, to all decide that flip phones are the future. They can and should keep working on slab phones and foldables because those have their place and their users. But we had it right in 2003: the best kind of phone is a flip phone. Phones got smarter, and their shape got worse. It&#39;s time for us to finally get the best of both worlds.</p></blockquote><p> I enjoy an honest contrarian take as much as the next person, but I legit don&#39;t get why any company makes one of these, let alone why Pierce would suggest they might go mainstream. Foldables I sort of get, in terms of potential — you carry a double-thick rectangular phone in exchange for a tablet-sized large screen when unfolded. I&#39;ve yet to see one that seems good, but I get the potential for the basic concept — bigger screens are better, all things considered. <em>Westworld</em> ’s super-thin tablets that fold into pocketable phones are the best vision for this I&#39;ve seen, and the best examination of <em>Westworld</em> ’s tablets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek">was published by ... The Verge, back in 2018</a> .</p><p> But a flip phone that folds into a double-thick square? I don&#39;t get it. You gain no reduction in volume or weight, and no increase in usable screen real estate. But now you have an extra step each time you want to use your phone, an additional point of mechanical failure on the device, and a form factor that isn&#39;t compatible with putting your phone in a protective case.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Counterpoint: Flip Phones Are a Dumb Idea’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Time Flies, Reddit-Scale </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvd" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/time-flies-reddit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40009</id><published> 2023-06-14T23:38:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-15T02:22:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>My thanks to Retool for sponsoring last week at DF. Programming hasn&#39;t fundamentally changed in a long time. Building an app usually means searching for the right component library, debugging dependencies, rewriting a lot of boilerplate code, and figuring out where and how to deploy. Everything but solving the problem at hand.</p><p> Retool is a new approach, unifying the ease of visual programming with the power and flexibility of real code. Connect to any database or API. Use drag-and-drop to design your UI while simultaneously live-programming it. Deploy instantly and scale as you grow. You can use Retool to build web apps, native iOS and Android apps, and automated workflows to help your business run.</p><p> Retool&#39;s customers use it to solve all kinds of business problems 10× faster: Plaid uses Retool to manage integration product support. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. You, too, can use it to manage users and orders, analyze data, run developer operations, or build any other business-critical application, fast. <a href="https://retool.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball">Start building for free today</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Retool’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/11/retool">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/the_talk_show_live_from_wwdc_2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv8" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40004</id><published> 2023-06-10T18:37:49Z</published><updated> 2023-06-12T00:20:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Back in San Jose&#39;s historic California Theatre for the first time since 2019, special guests John Ternus, Mike Rockwell, Craig Federighi, and Greg Joswiak join me to discuss the news and announcements from WWDC 2023. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The moderators of the popular r/iPhone are taking it private:</p><blockquote><p> Q: <em>What does making r/iPhone private mean, in this case?</em></p><p> A: Taking r/iPhone private means that no-one, except moderators and approved submitters, can see the subreddit&#39;s front page. When attempting to access the subreddit, you will be met with a blank screen stating “r/iPhone has been set to private by its subreddit moderators.”</p><p> Q: <em>What does indefinite mean in this case?</em></p><p> A: Originally, the protest was planned to be 48 hours. However, after a shambolic AMA held by Reddit&#39;s CEO, it has become clear to us that Reddit doesn&#39;t intend to act in good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread libellous claims about another third-party developer, and then try double down by vilifying them, again, in an AMA, despite being proven as a liar by the developer through audio recordings, that&#39;s when we knew what we were up against. Therefore, the subreddit will be privatised until such time as a reasonable resolution is proposed.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/145vns0/the_future_of_rvideos/">The moderators at r/Videos are doing the same</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Q: <em>Won&#39;t Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?</em></p><p> A: This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the “health” of their site is more important to them. We as a team are prepared for this, none of us want to continue to volunteer for a company that disrespects the people who helped build it into the front page of the internet.</p><p> Q: <em>An indefinite lockdown? I thought this was only supposed to be for 48 hours?</em></p><p> A: Originally it was our intention to spread awareness of these issues, but over the past week it has become clear that Reddit doesn&#39;t intend to act in good faith, and our role in the protest became clear. The owners of Reddit have taken their users, community developers, and their moderator teams for granted and used them to build up a multimillion dollar company which is now focused not on the community, but on how many commas they can get out of Silicon Valley investors.</p></blockquote><p> For posterity: screen captures of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/r-iphone-boycott.pdf">r/iPhone</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/r-videos-boycott.pdf">r/Videos</a> threads.</p><p> **Update: <a href="https://reddark.untone.uk/">Live-updated list of subreddits going dark or read-only on Monday</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reddit Users Revolt’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/10/reddit-users-revolt">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apollo Is a Work of Art </title><link href="https://mastodon.social/@christianselig/110509739563895220" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-work-of-art" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40002</id><published> 2023-06-09T23:15:35Z</published><updated> 2023-06-09T23:15:35Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> I gotta be honest, this Huffman guy sure looks like a lying creep, and all of Reddit&#39;s public statements about honoring third-party apps seem like an attempt to lie to Redditors so they don&#39;t look like the bad guys. But the bottom line is that Reddit repriced its API in order to bankrupt third-party apps. (Selig says he&#39;ll lose $250,000 in the shutdown.)</p></blockquote><p> It seems pretty clear that all of Huffman&#39;s recent decisions are driven by Reddit&#39;s hoped-for IPO. On one front is the ugly fact that Reddit&#39;s valuation is sinking. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/fidelity-reddit-valuation/">TechCrunch reported last week</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Fidelity, the lead investor in Reddit&#39;s most recent funding round in 2021, has slashed the estimated worth of its equity stake in the popular social media platform by 41% since the investment. [...]</p><p> This devaluation, part of a broader trend that has hit a variety of growth stage startups across the globe in the past year, raises uncertainties about whether Reddit will maintain its initial intent to reportedly go public at a valuation around $15 billion.</p></blockquote><p> On the other front is OpenAI, currently buoyed by a sky-high valuation, and which used Reddit content as part of its massive training data. The whole point of going from free-of-charge to very-expensive with these APIs is to get OpenAI and similar companies to pay for them. It&#39;s a pipe dream. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-openai-chatgpt-ipo-valuation-karma-2023-6">Julie Bort at Insider</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable. But we don&#39;t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free,” said Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit.</p><p> I asked ChatGPT if it is going to pay for Reddit data. It told me its training data cut-off was September 2021 so it didn&#39;t know what was happening after that date.</p></blockquote><p> Reddit already gave all its data to large companies for free. Huffman is trying to charge now for horses that were let out of the barn years ago. And he obviously doesn&#39;t care about Apollo or other third-party Reddit clients, or what these moves do to Reddit&#39;s reputation as a platform vendor. He&#39;s just trapped in a fantasy where investors are going to somehow see Reddit as a player in the current moment of AI hype.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reddit’s Hoped-For IPO and Pipe Dream of Cashing in on OpenAI’s Hype’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/reddit-ipo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Facing Reddit&#39;s Exorbitant API Pricing, Christian Selig Is Shutting Down Apollo </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40000</id><published> 2023-06-09T17:37:06Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T00:49:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

This fortunately resonated with people immediately, and it&#39;s been my full time job ever since.</p><p> Today&#39;s a much sadder post than that initial one eight years ago. June 30th will be Apollo&#39;s last day.</p><p> I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people, and come to terms with this over the last weeks as talks with Reddit have deteriorated to an ugly point, and in the interest of transparency with the community, I wanted to talk about how I arrived at this decision, and if you have any questions at the end, I&#39;m more than happy to answer. This post will be long as I have a lot of topics to cover.</p><p> Please note that I recorded all my calls with Reddit, so my statements are not based on memory, but the recorded statements by Reddit over the course of the year. One-party consent recording is legal in my country of Canada. Also I won&#39;t be naming names, that&#39;s not important and I don&#39;t want to doxx people.</p></blockquote><p> Given what we knew about Reddit&#39;s stance on this API pricing a week ago, this isn&#39;t surprising, but it still feels tragic. Apollo — like Tweetbot and Twitterrific before it — isn&#39;t merely a nice client for a particular service. It&#39;s one of the best apps ever made, full stop.</p><p> Let&#39;s stop attributing this shutdown to “Reddit” the company, though, and pin responsibility where it truly lies: on Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman, personally. When Twitter killed third-party clients everyone naturally and correctly pinned responsibility on Elon Musk, because Musk is very famous and very much public in his stewardship of Twitter now that he owns it.</p><p> I&#39;ll bet many of you reading this, even Reddit users, couldn&#39;t recall Reddit&#39;s CEO&#39;s name before I named Huffman above. But it&#39;s clear from Selig&#39;s description — and his receipts, as it were — that Huffman is intimately involved in this decision, and is not only responsible, but is actively besmirching Selig with provably false accusations of both extortion <em>and</em> shoddy engineering.</p><p> Reddit didn&#39;t kill Apollo. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman did.</p><p> Let&#39;s see if Huffman has the courage to go through with <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/">this planned AMA today to discuss Reddit&#39;s API policy changes</a> . I have one simple question for him: What do you think Reddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/d2njs/comment/c0x40yz/">co-founder</a> <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a> would say about this if he were still alive?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Facing Reddit’s Exorbitant API Pricing, Christian Selig Is Shutting Down Apollo’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Lionel Messi Is Coming to MLS, With a Revenue Sharing Deal From Apple </title><link href="https://500ish.com/apples-messi-strategy-48bd95fe006" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv3" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/messi-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39999</id><published> 2023-06-09T16:51:11Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T23:40:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MG Siegler:</p><blockquote><p> Earlier today, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-inter-miami-mls.html">announced</a> that Lionel Messi, the world&#39;s greatest soccer player, would be leaving Europe behind and joining Inter Miami. This matters because the biggest name in <a href="https://500ish.com/a-most-beautiful-game-e3a3dcbd228d">fútbol</a> (soccer), and arguably in all sports, is coming to America. But it also matters because he&#39;s coming to play in the MLS. A league that has an exclusive television deal with Apple. And as such, Apple apparently helped lure Messi over with an extraordinary offer: a cut of revenue from new subscribers to their Season Pass service.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d be very curious to learn just how big a revenue share Messi is getting from Apple, but regardless of the details, this is simply an extraordinary coup for both MLS and Apple TV+. There are only a handful of athletes who are so good, and so beloved, that they can singlehandedly elevate an entire <em>league</em> in a team sport. Lionel Messi is one of them.</p><blockquote><p> Of the people who got early looks at Vision Pro, there&#39;s seemingly universal praise for the NBA court-side and MLB dugout demos. These were apparently shot with special cameras which Apple manufactured to be able to capture footage that could take full advantage of the viewing experience on the new device. It will likely take a bit for this type of content to become more widespread and accepted amongst the leagues. You know where it won&#39;t be? MLS. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666535803068256259">I fully expect</a> Apple to be filming games with their new Spatial Cameras (I made up the name, but it seems like something they might use… ) soon, if they haven&#39;t started already! Apple isn&#39;t undercutting any other TV rights here (as they might be with say, the NBA), <a href="https://mgs.blog/skating-to-where-the-soccer-ball-will-be-bc889b8c368">they have exclusive rights</a> . To display any game, any time, <em>anywhere</em> on any device.</p></blockquote><p> It occurred to me after my demo with Vision Pro that it was slightly surprising that Apple included spatial presentations of NBA basketball and MLB baseball, but not MLS soccer — the sport TV+ is most all-in on. (Apple does of course have weekly national broadcasts of MLB with Friday Night Baseball.) But I&#39;ll eat my hat if Apple isn&#39;t planning to broadcast entire MLS games with this technology.</p><blockquote><p> And finally, fifth, much like Apple used AT&amp;T as their exclusive carrier for the iPhone when it launched,</strong"> <a href=”https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666536683251339272<strong>I could see them</a> using their MLS deal in a similar manner. That is, work with a league/carrier that is willing to break norms and allow Apple to be in control of the product and offering. And when it&#39;s a success, watch the other leagues/carriers trip over themselves to get in line. It worked with the iPhone. Will it work here? Feels like a pretty good bet to make.</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly what I was thinking when I mentioned <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos#fn2-2023-06-07">in a footnote in my first impressions piece this week</a> that the NFL in particular might have made a colossal mistake signing a long-term deal with Google for Sunday Ticket broadcast rights.

<p>I got to spend about 30 minutes Monday afternoon using a Vision Pro and VisionOS at Apple Park, in a temporary “field house” building Apple constructed specifically for this experience. This was a one-on-one guided tour with someone from the Vision product marketing team, with the ground rules that I&#39;m allowed to talk about everything I experienced, but photos and videos were not permitted.</p><p> It was a very fast 30 minutes, and the experience was, in a word, immersive. I&#39;d pay good money just to run through the exact same 30 minutes again.</p><p> It was nowhere near enough time, nor was I able to wander far off the rails of the prepared demos. It&#39;s very clear that the OS and apps are far from finished. But even given the brevity of the demo and constraints of the current state of the software, there are a few things I feel confident about describing.</p><p> First: the overall technology is extraordinary, and far better than I expected. And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">like my friend and Dithering co-host Ben Thompson</a> , my expectations were high. Apple exceeded them. Vision Pro and VisionOS feel like they&#39;ve been pulled forward in time from the future. I haven&#39;t had that feeling about a new product since the original iPhone in 2007. There are several aspects of the experience that felt impossible.</p><p> Is it a compelling <em>product</em> , though? It&#39;s a famous Steve Jobs axiom that technology is not enough, that you don&#39;t make compelling products — let alone entire platforms — starting from advanced technology and working backward. You start with a vision for the product and platform experience and then create new technology to make it real. I simply can&#39;t say whether Vision Pro is going to be a compelling product. I spent too little time with it, the software as of today is too far from complete, and, most importantly, the whole experience is too entirely new and mind-bending to render any such conclusion.</p><p> But the potential for Vision Pro to be a compelling product, across several use cases, is obvious. This might be great. And without question it is interesting, and I think the fundamental conceptual bones Apple has designed for VisionOS lay the groundwork for a long future. The first generation Vision Pro may or may not be a successful product — I simply don&#39;t want to speculate on that front yet. But even just a small taste of VisionOS made me feel confident that it is going to be the next major platform for Apple and Apple developers, alongside MacOS and iOS/iPadOS. <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-07">1</a></sup></p><hr /><p> A few years ago I stopped wearing contact lenses and have since worn corrective eyeglasses full-time. Before my demo, a rep from Apple took my glasses and used a device to measure my lenses to provide corrective lens inserts for my demo unit. It only took about 3 or 4 minutes. When Vision Pro goes on sale next year, buying corrective lens inserts will probably work like buying eyeglasses online from a retailer like Warby Parker — you&#39;ll provide a copy of your prescription from your eye doctor. It&#39;ll be a slight hassle for us glasses wearers, but not much, and it&#39;s unavoidable. (I see pretty well close up without glasses, so I&#39;m curious how well I might see using Vision Pro without corrective lenses.) After the lens measurement I used an iPhone to do a brief facial scan akin to registering for Face ID (look at the phone, turn your head in a circle), and an ear scan. This test was for identifying a light seal that would best block light, and calibrating the speakers.</p><p> My demo was conducted in a relatively spacious living room. I sat on a couch. My tour guide, as it were, from product marketing sat on an arm chair next to the couch. We took a few minutes to go through the strap adjustments to make it comfortable on my face. My light seal was good, but not perfect. The single biggest downside from my demo experience is that Vision Pro feels heavier on your face than I had hoped it would. It&#39;s not uncomfortable — at least not for 30 minutes — but I never forgot it was there, and it just makes your head feel a bit front-heavy.</p><p> The first run experience wearing Vision Pro requires a few minutes of very simple eye-tracking calibration exercises. You hold your head still, and VisionOS shows a series of dots in front of you, on a pure black background. Moving only your eyes, not your head, you simply look at each dot in front of you as they appear. After a minute or two of that, boom, you&#39;re in.</p><p> What you see at first is just ... your world. You just see the room you&#39;re in. There&#39;s no status information, no metadata, no indicators. Just input from the cameras on the front of the headset, presented on the displays in front of your eyes. It does not magically look indistinguishable from real life, but it does not feel like looking at a screen <em>at all</em> . I perceived absolutely no latency. I definitely could not see pixels — the experience is “retina” quality. Apple is not yet stating what frame rate Vision Pro runs at, but I&#39;m guessing it runs at 90 frames per second, if not higher.</p><p> Again, it doesn&#39;t look at all like looking at screens inside a headset. It looks like reality, albeit through something like a pair of safety glasses or a large face-covering clear shield. There is no border in the field of vision — your field of view through Vision Pro exactly matches what you see through your eyes without it. Most impressively, and uncannily, the field of view seemingly <em>exactly</em> matches what you see naturally. It&#39;s not even slightly wider angle, or even slightly more telephoto. There is no fisheye effect and no aberrations or distortion in your peripheral vision. What you see in front of your face exactly matches what your own eyes see when you lift the Vision Pro up over your eyes. Imagine a set of safety glasses that used a glass treatment that gives the world a slight bit of a “film look”. A slight tint (that tint might get dialed in closer to reality by next year — to me it felt ever so slightly warm, color-wise), and a slight bit of visually flattering smoothness to everything.</p><p> To do anything in VisionOS, you start by single-pressing the digital crown button above your right eye. (The other top button, on the left, will be used to capture spatial photos and videos, but that button was disabled on our demo units yesterday). Press the digital crown button and boom, your home screen of app icons appears in a plane in front of you. Long-press the digital crown button and it re-centers your virtual world in front of whatever you&#39;re now looking at.</p><p> The navigation model of VisionOS is a breakthrough of conceptual simplicity. You simply look at something and tap your index finger and thumb, on either of your hands. I&#39;ll call this “tapping” for lack of a better verb. When you look at any tappable UI element in VisionOS, it is visually highlighted. This highlighting is extremely similar to the hover effect in iPadOS when using a trackpad or mouse. In iPadOS, if you move the mouse pointer circle to a button or icon, that button/icon pops a bit, visually. If you look at a button or icon in VisionOS, that button/icon pops a bit. Some apps have toolbars with a dark background and gray button icons. Look at a button and that button will turn white. Tap your finger and thumb while looking at it and it activates.就是这样。 Incredibly simple, surprisingly effective.</p><p> At first I found myself reaching out to pinch the icons and buttons I saw in front of me. Like if I wanted to activate Safari I&#39;d reach my hand toward the Safari icon and pinch it. That works fine. But it&#39;s completely unnecessary. You really can just leave your hands on your lap. It works when you try to pinch the actual virtual icon in your field of vision because you are looking at the icon, and your finger and thumb do tap, but your hands can be anywhere. All that matters is what you&#39;re looking at. It started feeling natural within just a minute or two, and I could feel myself navigating the interface faster as the demo went on.</p><p> The next most striking aspect of the experience is that everything in VisionOS is completely stable in space. Let&#39;s say you open a Safari window, then open a Messages window next to it. (You can move windows around the room by pinching and dragging on a “Window Bar” that hovers underneath every window. You can move windows left/right, up/down, <em>and</em> closer/further away from you.) Then you turn your head 90 degrees to your side, then turn your head to the other side, and then return your gaze to the center. Those windows for Safari and Messages do not move at all, relative to the real world. Not even a little. You know how when you use AR on an iPhone or iPad — the built-in Measure app is a perfect example — and virtual UI elements or items move around a little bit relative to reality as you pan and rotate the iPhone or iPad? There&#39;s nothing like that in VisionOS. Virtual elements are utterly stable. Obviously that&#39;s what you <em>want</em> in an XR experience, but to my knowledge no other headset can achieve this stability. My understanding is that this profound stability — this palpable <em>realness</em> of virtual elements — is thanks to the extraordinary precise eye-tracking that Vision Pro achieves. <em>Uncanny</em> is often a pejorative — eg with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> — but in this case I use it as strong praise. It is simply uncanny how Vision Pro makes virtual elements as spatially stable as the walls and furniture and people in the room around you.</p><p> There&#39;s also a top-level “Environments” tab on the left side of the home screen. Everything I&#39;ve described thus far took place in the de facto default “environment” which is your actual surroundings. But the Environments tab allows you to switch from pass-through camera reality to a virtual reality. One of the locations I experienced was Mount Hood. Choose it and it&#39;s like you&#39;re there. These environments are incredibly immersive, 360 degrees. And so instead of catching up on Mail and Messages in floating windows in your living room, you can do it while it appears like you&#39;re atop a mountain, or on a beach, or, well, anywhere. It&#39;s beautiful, and every bit as stable spatially as pass-through reality. When you&#39;re in an immersive environment, you can turn the digital crown to adjust how far it wraps around your field of vision. Fully immersive means you don&#39;t see anything from your actual physical environment; partial immersion dials it back from your periphery to the center, with blurred dream-like edges.</p><p> Lastly, “breakthrough” is Apple&#39;s term for a feature that identifies real human beings who approach you while immersed. They sort of fade in, as transparent ghosts. But not spooky ghosts. It&#39;s a seamless feature, and given my experience with other VR headsets, a necessary one to avoid being isolated from the people around you once you&#39;re immersed. You see someone fade into view, and you can turn the digital crown to dial back the degree of immersion and truly look at them.</p><hr /><p> Apple is <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1665806600261763072">promoting</a> the Vision Pro announcement as the launch of “the era of spatial computing”. That term feels perfect. It&#39;s not AR, VR, or XR. It&#39;s spatial computing, and some <em>aspects</em> of spatial computing are AR or VR.</p><p> To me the Macintosh has always felt more like a <em>place</em> than a <em>thing</em> . Not a place I go physically, but a place my mind goes intellectually. When I&#39;m working or playing and in the flow, it has always felt like MacOS is where I <em>am</em> . I&#39;m in the Mac. Interruptions — say, the doorbell or my phone ringing — are momentarily disorienting when I&#39;m in the flow on the Mac, because I&#39;m pulled out of that world and into the physical one. There&#39;s a similar effect with iOS too, but I&#39;ve always found it less profound. Partly that&#39;s the nature of iOS, which doesn&#39;t speak to me, idiomatically, like MacOS does. I think in many ways that explains why I never feel <em>in the flow</em> on an iPad like I can on a Mac, even with the same size display. But with the iPhone in particular screen size is an important factor. I don&#39;t think <em>any</em> hypothetical phone OS could be as immersive as I find MacOS, simply because even the largest phone display is so small. Watching a movie on a phone is a lesser experience than watching on a big TV set, and watching a movie on even a huge TV is a lesser experience than watching a movie in a nice theater. We humans are visual creatures and our field of view affects our sense of importance. Size matters.</p><p> The <em>worlds</em> , as it were, of MacOS and iOS (or Windows, or Android, or whatever) are defined and limited by the displays on which they run. If MacOS is a place I go mentally when working, that place is manifested physically by the Mac&#39;s display. It&#39;s like the playing field, or the court, in sports — it has very clear, hard and fast, rectangular bounds. It is of fixed size and shape, and everything I do in that world takes place in the confines of those display boundaries.</p><p> VisionOS is very much going to be a conceptual place like that for work. But there is no display. There are no boundaries. The intellectual “place” where the apps of VisionOS are presented is the real-world place in which you use the device, or the expansive virtual environment you choose. The room in which you&#39;re sitting is the canvas. The whole room. The display on a Mac or iOS device is to me like a portal, a rectangular window into a well-defined virtual world. With VisionOS the virtual world is the actual world around you.</p><p> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. Using a Mac, you are in a physical place, there is a display in front of you in that place, and on that display are application windows. Using VisionOS, there are just application windows in the physical place in which you are. On Monday I had Safari and Messages and Photos open, side by side, each in a window that seemed the size of a movie poster — that is to say, each app in a window that appeared larger than any actual computer display I&#39;ve ever used. All side by side. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Some of the videos in Apple&#39;s Newsroom post</a> introducing Vision Pro illustrate this. But seeing a picture of an actor in this environment doesn&#39;t do justice to experiencing it firsthand, because a photo showing this environment itself has defined rectangular borders.</p><p> This is not confusing or complex, but it feels profound. Last night I chatted with a friend who, I found out only then, has been using Vision Pro for months inside Apple. While talking about this “your real world room is your canvas for arranging your application windows” aspect of the experience, he said that he spent weeks feeling a bit constrained, keeping his open VisionOS windows all in front of him as though on a virtual display, before a colleague opened his mind to <em>spreading out</em> and making applications windows much larger and arranging them in a wider carousel not merely in front of him but <em>around</em> him. The constraints of even the largest physical display simply do not exist with VisionOS.</p><hr /><p> I&#39;d group everything I experienced Monday into three loose categories.</p><p> The first, for lack of a better term, is simply “computing”. Work, as it were. Reading web pages, talking via FaceTime, reading email or messages. Using <em>apps</em> . You start with an iOS-like grid of app icons, tap on apps to open them in windows, and arrange and resize those windows however you want. Text is very readable in windows. My brief 30 minute demo covered a lot, so I have zero perspective on how pleasant or tolerable it is to read for long stretches of time, but my impression is that it&#39;s more than fine. Windows look solid, text looks crisp, and you can make windows really big in virtual space. If anything is going to seem weird or wrong about long-form reading in VisionOS, it&#39;s not the visual fidelity, but rather the fact that I&#39;ve never once in my life read an article or email message in a window that appeared 4 or 5 feet tall.</p><p> The second type of experience is the consumption of 2D content, like photos and videos. Watching a regular movie on a virtual huge screen is incredible. It&#39;s way more like watching a movie in a real cinema than like watching on a TV. One of the movies Apple had us watch was James Cameron&#39;s <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> , both in a window floating in front of us, and then in “theater mode”, which immersively removes your actual physical surroundings. Cameron shot <em>Avatar 2</em> with state-of-the-art 3D cameras, and the 3D effect was, as promised, better than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in a theater or theme park. I don&#39;t generally like 3D feature-length movies at all — I find myself not remembering them afterwards — but I might watch movies like <em>Avatar</em> this way with Vision Pro. But even though <em>Avatar</em> is 3D, it&#39;s still a rectangular movie. It&#39;s just presented as a very large rectangle with very compelling 3D depth inside that rectangle.</p><p> The third type of experience is fully immersive. Content Apple commissioned and created that is inherently only consumable in three dimensions. Full immersion, like transporting you to a cliff&#39;s edge atop a mountain, or lakeside on a beautiful spring day. Some of these immersive environments surround you completely — you can turn around 360 degrees, and look up at the sky or down at the ground (or, dizzyingly, down over the cliff&#39;s edge). Another custom experience involved a portal opening on the wall across the room, out of which first flew a small butterfly that landed on my extended finger. This is so compelling that some of the media people who experienced it had their minds tricked into <em>feeling</em> the butterfly land. I did not, but I can see why they did. Then, a dinosaur — a velociraptor-looking thing, seemingly about 9 or 10 feet tall — approached the “portal” in the wall and came halfway through into the room. I was invited to stand up from the couch and approach it. There was a coffee table in front of the couch, a possible shin-banging accident waiting to happen, but the pass-through video experience is so seamless, so natural, so much like just looking through glasses, not looking at a screen inside a headset, that it took no concentration or carefulness at all on my part to stand up and walk around the coffee table and approach the dinosaur. The dinosaur was not pre-recorded. It reacted, live, to me, keeping eye contact with me at all times. It was spooky, and a significant part of my own lizard brain was instinctively <em>very</em> alarmed. I got extremely close to the dinosaur&#39;s head, and the illusion that it was real never broke down. Even up close, there was no sign that it was composed of polygons stitched together or something. It looked like a 10-foot tall dinosaur that could kill me with a snap of its jaws, right there in the room with me, as close to my face as the MacBook Pro display on which I&#39;m writing these words is right now.</p><p> Spatial photos and videos — photos and videos shot with the Vision Pro itself — are viewed as a sort of hybrid between 2D content and fully immersive 3D content. They don&#39;t appear in a crisply defined rectangle. Rather, they appear with a hazy dream-like border around them. Like some sort of teleportation magic spell in a Harry Potter movie or something. The effect reminded me very much of Steven Spielberg&#39;s <em>Minority Report</em> , in the way that Tom Cruise&#39;s character <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">could obsessively watch “memories” of his son</a> , and the way the psychic “precogs” perceive their visions of murders about to occur. It&#39;s like watching a dream, but through a portal opened into another world.</p><p> Lastly, we saw two sports demos: an at-bat from a baseball game at Fenway Park (Phil Schiller&#39;s hands are all over that one), and a scoring play from a Nuggets-Suns NBA basketball game. For the baseball game, the perspective wasn&#39;t even from the stands, but rather from the home team&#39;s dugout, ground level, right behind first base. It&#39;s not quite <em>just</em> like being there, but it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like being there. It&#39;s more realistic than seems possible. You choose where to direct your gaze: at the batter at home plate, at the pitcher, or out in the outfield. Or above the outfielders, at the scoreboard. For the NBA game, the perspective was courtside, right behind the basket. But better than the actual courtside perspective, because the perspective was slightly elevated above seating level. Fully immersive, fully three-dimensional, and seemingly perfectly to scale. Kevin Durant looked about 6&#39;10&quot;, right in front of me. Getting the scale just right is obviously the correct way to present this, but it seems devilishly tricky to actually pull off. Apple has pulled it off. These baseball and basketball scenes were shot by Apple using entirely custom camera rigs, and stored in altogether new file formats. This is nothing at all like 2D footage extrapolated into 3D, or just painted on a virtual circular wall around you. It looks real. It seems as profoundly different from watching regular TV telecasts of sports as TV telecasts are from audio-only radio broadcasts. <sup id="fnr2-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn2-2023-06-07">2</a></sup> It was incredible. I would genuinely consider buying a Vision Pro if the one and only thing it did was show entire sporting events like this.</p><p> The first two types of experiences — doing computer “work”, and watching 2D and 2D-ish 3D content, have analogs to existing experiences. Using Safari in VisionOS is like using Safari on a Mac or iPad, but with a different presentation. Watching a movie in VisionOS is just watching a movie, albeit with the completely convincing illusion that you&#39;re looking at an enormous room-filling cinema screen. But the third, these original immersive experiences, have no analogs except to the real world. It&#39;s extraordinary, and only possible because Apple has gotten so many little things so exactly right.</p><p> I walked away from my demo more than a bit discombobulated. Not because it was disorienting or even the least bit nauseating, but because it was so unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. It strikes me that in some ways Bob Iger&#39;s cameo during the keynote had the relationship between Apple and Disney backwards. Iger spent his keynote cameo talking about Disney creating original new content for VisionOS&#39;s new medium. But after experiencing it, it felt more like what Disney should want is Apple providing this technology for Disney to use in their theme parks. The sports and dinosaur demos I experienced using Vision Pro were in many ways more immersive and thrilling than tentpole major attractions I&#39;ve experienced at Disney World.</p><p> Are you going to want to buy a Vision Pro for $3,500? That price is high enough that the answer is probably not, for most of you, no matter how compelling it is. But are you going to want to try one out for an hour or two, and find yourself craving another hour or two? I guarantee it. You need to see it. <sup id="fnr3-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn3-2023-06-07">3</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-07"><p> I mean no disrespect to WatchOS or even tvOS by leaving them off that list. But what I mean here by “major platform” is a platform that could serve as a serious user&#39;s primary or sole computing device. Something you use for any combination of work, entertainment, and content creation. Apple Watch isn&#39;t that, but of course isn&#39;t meant to be that. Apple Watch is sort of a hybrid between a platform (like iPhone) and a peripheral (like AirPods). <a href="#fnr1-2023-06-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-06-07"><p> These sports examples were so exciting, so viscerally compelling, that it makes me wonder whether Apple demoed this, or even described it, in confidence, with NFL executives while negotiating for the rights to Sunday Ticket that the NFL wound up selling to Google for YouTube TV.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/1659593595643662336-vhv6gL8w">Ben Bajarin on Twitter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If Apple is releasing a VR/AR headset this year, it makes more sense for a dedicated event or bundle it with a Mac event in the fall.</p><p> There is too much ground to cover at WWDC, and 30 min is not enough to tell the full product story.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been thinking about this too. The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple&#39;s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we&#39;re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it&#39;s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that&#39;s an easy announcement: it&#39;s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it&#39;s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850">Last year&#39;s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos">here&#39;s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p><p> But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There&#39;s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn&#39;t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn&#39;t. They might have ideally wanted to announce it <em>before</em> this year&#39;s WWDC at a special event, but if they want developers to start creating software for the platform, this is the time. (And why wouldn&#39;t they want developers to start working on ideas?)</p><p> Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p><p> Here&#39;s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren&#39;t just pre-recorded, they&#39;re very tightly edited. I suspect we&#39;ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It&#39;ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem with the new “keynote movie” format. <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-19">1</a></sup> We won&#39;t come out of the keynote thinking it was too long; we&#39;ll come out of it with our heads spinning because it&#39;s going to cover so much, so fast.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-19"><p> And if I&#39;m right, I bet this is one of those years where after the keynote is over, and people start poring over everything Apple puts on the web, we discover a surprising number of very cool iOS and MacOS features that didn&#39;t make it into the keynote. Anything and everything from the OSes might get cut to make time for the headset, xrOS, and Mac hardware announcements. There&#39;s a whole second State of the Union technical keynote in the afternoon where features cut from the main morning keynote can go. <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ On Apple Fitting a Headset Announcement Into the Always-Packed WWDC Keynote</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
