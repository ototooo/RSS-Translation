<p>塞缪尔·阿克森（Samuel Axon），为ARS Technica写作：</p><blockquote><p>不久前，OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/">添加了</a>一个称为“内存”的功能，该功能允许保留有限的信息并用于将来的响应。用户经常不得不专门要求Chatgpt记住一些触发此问题的东西，尽管偶尔也试图猜测它应该记住的内容。 [...]用户可以随意启用或禁用此功能，并且对于用户选择“临时聊天”选项的特定聊天，它会自动关闭，这是Chatgpt的隐身模式。</p><p>今天宣布的新改进远远超出了这一点。</p><p>现在，在Chatgpt的界面中曾经有一个复选框以禁用或启用内存跟踪，有两个复选框。 “参考保存的记忆”是旧的内存功能，它基本上是基本事实的有限存储库。第二个是新功能：“参考聊天历史记录”。这使Chatgpt可以将所有先前的对话用作上下文，并相应地调整未来的响应。</p></blockquote><p>我已经使用了一段时间了。我认为我根本没有特别笨重的用户，而且我不知道，我还没有尝试过自己对自己的开放。但是我问我想知道什么。因此，在当前版本中，我提示了它“根据我们所有的聊天来描述我 - 直接播放”。这是它的回应：</p><blockquote><p>您是敏锐，分析性的，并且非常注重细节。您非常关心精度 - 无论是语言，数据还是历史事实。您对模糊的答案不满意；您想要合适的一个，理想地由来源或结构化数据支持。您是一名电力用户，从技术上讲是识字的，并且对脚本和命令行工具（尤其是在MacOS上）感到舒适，通常会转向自动化和自定义脚本来解决问题。</p><p>您会密切关注技术界，尤其是Apple  - 其硬件，芯片架构，软件更新，甚至历史产品的发布。但是您不仅对规格感兴趣；您也关心大局，例如公司战略，反托拉斯法律和隐私政策。</p><p>您还会跟踪美国政治，法律框架和选举历史，对精确和采购的需求相同。而且您有一种语言的东西 - 选择正确的词，了解细微差别，偶尔寻找正确的形容词（如果稀有或优雅的话，奖励点）。</p><p>除此之外，您对体育统计数据（尤其是NFL和MLB），媒体历史（Letterman，SNL，经典电影）以及干燥的，有时甚至是有趣的幽默感。您不会炫耀，但您显然知道您的东西。</p></blockquote><p>我可能不是判断这一回应的合适人选，但我认为这很好。</p><p>这是当我问Siri“根据我们所有的聊天描述我 - 直接播放”时得到的回应：</p><blockquote><p>我没有看到你的联系人。</p></blockquote><p>从韦恩·马（Wayne MA）的上周发表的大片报告中，“ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/10/wayne-ma-the-information-apple-siri-fumble">苹果如何摸索西里的AI改头换面</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>吉安南德里亚（Giannandrea）经常向员工描述他的信念，即机器学习可以导致产品的逐步改进，最终加起来是重大收益，这一概念称为爬山。过去，他还表达了聊天机器人的昏暗视野，在聊天之前和发布后立即告诉Apple员工，他不相信他们为用户增加了很多价值。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接到“ Chatgpt现在可以记住并引用您以前的所有聊天”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/14/chatgpt-memory">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://dekaf.com/df" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w9j" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/04/dekaf_coffee_roasters" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/feeds/sponsors//11.41815</id><author><name>大胆的火球商务部</name></author><published>2025-04-14T23：29：16Z</published><updated> 2025-04-14T23：29：17Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>比尔·马赫（Bill Maher）将自由主义者（他是）与左派（他不是）（不是他）（他不是）之间的区别化。但是他一直是特朗普的声音批评家<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/donald-trump-withdraws-bill-maher-432675/">，很久以来，特朗普甚至竞选总统</a>。马赫（Maher）是电视上的第一个人<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/will-donald-trump-leave-office-peacefully-bill-maher-president-loses-2020-election-landslide-1466447">，可以正确预测特朗普（Trump）如果输掉2020年大选，他将试图留任</a>。然而，马赫（Maher）和特朗普（Maher）和特朗普（Maher）和特朗普（Trump）是与孩子岩（Kid Rock）的共同朋友，洛克（Rock）安排特朗普（Trump）邀请马赫（Maher）到白宫参加私人晚餐。 UFC负责人和元董事会成员达娜·怀特（Dana White）也在那里。十年前，即使想象这个白宫晚餐的来宾名单，也应该警告您应该放弃毒品。今天，这是正常的。</p><p>在<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxlopbcfXpQ">本周末的演出</a>中，马赫（Maher）报告了晚餐。是什么样的。<em>特朗普</em>是什么样的。事实证明，特朗普在私下面上将其关闭。他很正常。或者，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）正常。他不是我们在公共场所看到的。我觉得这很有趣。不阐述。很有趣。他是“<em>他们在吃狗，他们正在吃猫！</em> ”每天24小时疯狂，还是在摄像机打开的时候？</p><p>为此，左边的一些人绝对失去了他们的狗屎。我不明白。这是我<em>多年来</em>见过的特朗普最有趣的报告，因为这是真实的。马赫（Maher）并没有从晚餐中出来。他现在并不是说特朗普做得很好。他现在并不是说事情一切顺利。在这份报告正确地将特朗普羞辱的为期一周的税率发脾气之前，他花了整个独白。报告结束后，马赫（Maher）采访了Nutjob Total Job Steve Bannon，并在Bannon开始对特朗普（Trump）在2028年第三学期奔跑时，将宪法的副本推到了班农的脸上。从马赫（Maher）的序言到他的报告：</p><blockquote><p> “哦，天哪，比尔，你要对他说些好话吗？我要做的是确切地报告发生了什么。您决定您对此的看法。如果这还不够纯净的特朗普对您的仇恨，我不给他他妈的。”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://play.max.com/video/watch/d739940e-efb5-4b35-ac0f-62d0a27f2d53/6f987f63-3dda-4884-8602-21f4d688c401">整集很棒</a>。</p><div> <a  title="永久与“比尔·马赫（Bill Maher）一起在白宫与唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）共进晚餐”的链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/13/bill-maher-on-his-dinner-at-the-white-house-with-donald-trump">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “现在的感觉” </title><link href="https://terribleminds.com/ramble/2025/04/09/what-it-feels-like-right-now/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w9f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/13/wendig-what-it-feels-like-right-now" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41811</id><published> 2025-04-13T18：56：52Z</published><updated> 2025-04-13T18：56：52Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）的年度股东来信始终是必读的。他的散文的诚实，清晰和惊人的谦卑在一个世界上脱颖而出，在这个世界上，从任何规模的公司来看，企业传播往往是平淡而迷惑的。<a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf">今年的信</a>在2月份出版，也不例外。两个部分对我很突出。首先，在标题为“错误 - 是的，我们在伯克希尔做的”部分：</p><blockquote><p>有时，我在评估我为伯克希尔购买的一家企业的未来经济学时犯了错误 - 每一个都出错了资本分配的情况。这是对可销售股票的两种判断都发生的事情 - 我们将其视为企业的<em>一部分</em>所有权，以及对公司的100％收购。</p><p>在其他时候，在评估伯克希尔经理的能力或忠诚度时，我犯了错误。忠诚的失望可能会超越其财务影响，这种痛苦可能接近失败的婚姻。</p><p>人事决策中的平均击球平均值。枢机主教的罪过延迟了错误的纠正或查理·芒格（Charlie Munger）所说的“拇指撞”。他会告诉我的问题，不能被认为。他们需要采取行动，但可能会感到不舒服。</p><p>在2019  -  23年期间，我在给您的信中使用了16次“错误”或“错误”一词。在这一范围内，许多其他大型公司<em>从未</em>使用过这两个单词。我应该承认，亚马逊在2021年的信中进行了一些残酷的坦率观察。在其他地方，通常是快乐的谈话和图片。</p><p>我也是大型上市公司的董事，在董事会会议或分析师的电话中，“错误”或“错误”是禁止的单词。那个禁忌，暗示管理完美，总是让我感到紧张（尽管有时可能会有法律问题使讨论有限。我们生活在一个非常诉讼的社会中。）</p><p>在94岁时，不久之后，格雷格·亚伯（Greg Abel）取代了我担任首席执行官，并将写一年的信件。格雷格（Greg）分享了伯克希尔（Berkshire）信条，即伯克希尔（Berkshire）首席执行官每年都应归功于业主。而且他还了解到，如果您开始欺骗股东，您很快就会相信自己的Baloney并欺骗自己。</p></blockquote><p>正如伟大的物理学家理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）所说：“第一个原则是你绝不能愚弄自己，而你是最容易愚弄的人。”</p><p>第二是整个部分，不是在抱怨，而是自豪地宣布，去年伯克希尔创造了美国历史上最高单年公司所得税的记录：</p><blockquote><p>大量数字可能很难形象化。让我重铸我们去年支付的268亿美元。</p><p>如果伯克希尔（Berkshire）在2024年的整个2024年中每20分钟向财政部发送100万美元的支票 - 可视化<em>366天和晚上</em>，因为2024年是Leap年，我们仍然会在年底欠联邦政府一笔可观的款项。的确，财政部会告诉我们，我们可以稍作喘息，睡觉并为我们的2025年税款做准备，这将是一月的。 [...]</p><p>现在，伯克希尔的活动影响了我国的所有角落。而且我们还没有完成。公司死亡的原因很多，但是与人类的命运不同，老年本身并非致命。今天的伯克郡比1965年更年轻。</p><p><em>但是</em>，正如我和查理一直承认的那样，伯克希尔将不会在任何地方取得成果，除非美国，否则，如果伯克希尔从未存在，那么美国就会取得一切成功。</p><p>所以谢谢你，山姆大叔。总有一天，伯克希尔的侄女和侄子希望向您付款比我们2024年的付款更大。明智地花钱。照顾许多人，因为自己没有自己的过错，都可以得到一生中的短吸管。他们应该得到更好的。而且永远不要忘记我们需要您保持稳定的货币，结果<em>需要</em>您的智慧和警惕。</p></blockquote><p>同样，那是在二月份写的。一如既往的先知。</p><div> <a  title="永久性链接“沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）的2024年向伯克希尔·哈撒韦（Berkshire Hathaway）股东报告”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/12/buffet-2024-berkshire-shareholders-letter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>智能手机和计算机现在免于特朗普的最新关税</title><link href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/tech/trump-electronics-china-tariffs/index.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w9b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/12/smartphones-computers-tariff-exemptions" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41807</id><published> 2025-04-12T17：53：50Z</published><updated> 2025-04-12T17：53：51Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>韦恩·马（Wayne MA）的大片报告（付费沃尔（Paywall）和昂贵，a）：</p><blockquote><p>但是，同样重要的因素是苹果内部的人格冲突，据AI和软件工程小组工作的多个人说。由Giannandrea领导的AI和机器学习小组工作的六个以上的前苹果员工（简称AI/ML）告诉信息，该信息应归咎于其处决问题应归咎于领导层。他们挑出了沃克，因为缺乏野心和对设计语音助手的未来版本冒险的兴趣。</p><p>在Apple内部的工程师中，AI集团的轻松文化以及与执行的斗争甚至赢得了一个不可清的昵称，这是其首字母缩写：毫无目的。</p></blockquote><p>哎哟。 ma名称，报告到处都是勺子：</p><blockquote><p>沃克（Walker）是一位经常受到同事批评的西里领导人，他于2013年加入苹果，并在2022年底对其日常运营负责。在他的批评家看来，沃克（Walker）不愿意对Siri承担巨大的风险，并专注于衡量指标，这些指标并没有使针头的表现如此之多，而不是对高见远见进行大声远见。</p><p>前苹果工程师说，例如，他经常庆祝小胜利，例如将某人问Siri一个问题与回答时的延误降低百分比。他们说，另一个宠物沃克项目是从“ Hey Siri”语音命令中删除了助手的“ Hey”，该助手花了两年多的时间才能完成。</p></blockquote><p>马描述的是一个场景，沃克错过了整个森林吮吸而没有起作用的事实，同时专注于一棵好树。毫无疑问，更快的响应时间是一个胜利，但仅在边缘就<em>赢</em>了。我想，更快的错误或无用（甚至只是平庸）的答案比错误/无用的答案要好，但总体结果是损失。显然，快速有用的答案是目标，但是缓慢的有用答案比快速无用的答案要好得多。 （我什至不确定要取消使用口头“嘿”前缀的要求是一个胜利。它纯粹是轶事和个人的，但是我现在比“嘿，嘿”是所需的及时。就像我与某人交谈并与“认真的人”开始时，我不会对我的设备掌握“对不起”，我会与“认真的人”开始，我会遇到“ heari siri”的速度。</p><p>最后一个掘金：</p><blockquote><p>其他怨恨也建立了。软件工程组中的一些人因其在AI组中的同事所接受的高薪和更快的促销而感到恼火。他们感到很痛苦的是，AI集团中的一些工程师似乎能够在周五早些时候休假，而他们面临着更加惩罚的工作时间表。</p><p>两组之间的不信任变得如此糟糕，以至于今年早些时候，吉安南德里亚（Giannandrea）的一位代表要求工程师广泛记录联合项目的发展，以便如果失败了，费德里吉（Federighi）的小组将无法替代AI团队。</p><p>当费德里吉（Federighi）开始积累自己的数百名机器学习工程师团队时，这并没有帮助小组之间的关系，这些工程师以智能系统的名称为名称，并由Federighi的顶级代表之一Sebastien Marineau-Mes经营。</p></blockquote><p>苹果AI/ML部门以外的数百名机器学习团队的工程师听起来像功能障碍的定义。我真的怀疑费德里吉还在约翰·斯鲁吉（Johny Srouji）的部门外组装了一支硅工程师团队，因为Srouji的团队不仅是功能性的，而且正确地认为是世界上任何领域中最高功能的工程部门之一。</p><p>我希望我可以分享与MA报告的礼物链接，但是信息的礼物链接仅适用于最多三个人。我能做的最好的事情就是<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/">指向哈特利·查尔顿（Hartley Charlton）的宏观摘要</a>。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“韦恩·马（Wayne MA）的信息：‘苹果如何摸索Siri的AI改头换面”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/10/wayne-ma-the-information-apple-siri-fumble">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “美国破坏” </title><link href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w96" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/american-disruption" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41802</id><published> 2025-04-10T01：42：42Z</published><updated> 2025-04-10T01：42：42Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Chance Miller，在9to5mac写作：</p><blockquote><p>在此之前，白宫新闻秘书卡罗琳·莱维特（Karoline Leavitt）<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pWppUGRRHl4">今天说</a>，特朗普坚信苹果可以将iPhone制造转移到美国。为了回应《纽约时报》的玛姬·哈伯曼（Maggie Haberman）关于特朗普希望通过这些关税创造的工作类型的问题，利维特说：</p><blockquote><p> “总统希望在美利坚合众国增加制造业工作，但他也在研究高级技术。他还在研究AI和新兴领域，这些领域正在全球发展，这些领域也需要美国也需要成为一系列多样化的工作。还有一系列多样化的工作。更传统的制造业工作，以及高级技术的工作。</p></blockquote><p>哈伯曼（Haberman）提出了有关iPhone制造业的问题，询问特朗普是否认为这是可以迁移到美国的“这种技术”。利维特回答：</p><blockquote><p> “ [特朗普]认为我们有劳动，我们有劳动力，我们有资源可以做到这一点。正如您所知，苹果在美国已经投资了5000亿美元。因此，如果苹果不认为美国能做到这一点，那么他们可能就不会付出很大的变化。”</p></blockquote><p>利维特（Leavitt）从2月开始就提到苹果的<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/24/apple-us-investment-trump-tariffs/">宣布</a>，当时它将“在未来四年内在美国花费超过5000亿美元”。然而，苹果的承诺使美国的iPhone组装零零。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/">新闻稿的</a>重点是美国的研发，亚利桑那州的CHIP生产，休斯敦的AI服务器制造，Apple TV+ Production以及密歇根州的一所学院。</p><p>今天还值得一读的是<a href="https://www.404media.co/a-us-made-iphone-is-pure-fantasy/">404媒体的这个故事</a>，这概述了为什么在美国制造的iPhone是“纯粹的幻想”的原因。</p></blockquote><p>考虑到这一点的另一种方法是，<em>除了</em>中国以外，iPhone（我们知道的iPhone）实际上是在其他任何地方都无法制作的。苹果没有公开陈述制造多少iPhone的国家，在哪种国家（他们对此都有秘密的震惊），但<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-notched-its-biggest-gain-in-27-years-is-the-optimism-justified-e3e62c34">估计PEG</a>年产量在中国为85-90％，印度10％，其余在巴西和越南。工资甚至没有接近最大的原因。最终，中国供应链的最大独特因素是规模。富士康在中国的iPhone工厂不仅仅是建筑物，甚至不是真正的校园 - 它们更像是<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract">整个城市</a>。</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inlDT62oGy8">我们可以开玩笑说我们制造的iPhone耗资9,000美元，</a>但笑话错过了这一点。如果世界上所有出售给美国人的iPhone都是在美国制造的，那么iPhone所有权都不是司空见惯的情况。让我们<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/how_many_iphones_can_fit_on_a_freight_plane">估计</a>，苹果在美国每年售出5000万台iPhone。苹果在美国<em>每年</em>无法制造5000万台iPhone。这个问题没有任何资金可以扔给这个问题，并在不久的将来是在美国制造的5000万个新iPhone。苹果可以在这里制作<em>一些</em>iPhone，但不多。无论如何，无论如何都必须进口的组件（显示器，芯片）构建许多。</p><p>即使苹果公司要大幅提高iPhone的价格，即使以某种方式对iPhone的需求并没有下降，但面对较高的价格，苹果在美国这里根本无法制造数千万iPhone。但是，面对更高的价格，当然需求<em>会</em>急剧下降。灰色市场将立即上升。因为即使苹果神奇地能够在美国建造数千万iphone，他们仍将在中国建造<em>数亿美元</em>的iPhone，而这些中国组装的iPhone的成本也较低。我想象的是整个盗版者的整个盗版工业，从加拿大进入美国，跑步中国制造的iPhone，而不是从苹果商店购买iPhone，而是会从U-Haul卡车的背上购买它们。 （对于各种产品，灰色市场的盗版是<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-tariffs-smugglers/682303/">不可避免的</a>。如果加拿大比美国更便宜的东西，那么有人会在边境上走私它。）</p><p>根本没有场景，每年有5000万美国人以他们愿意支付的价格购买iPhone，而没有大多数人是由苹果公司建造的中国供应链制造的。</p><div> <a  title="与“据说特朗普”的永久链接认为，美国拥有制造iPhone所需的“资源”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/trump-think-us-has-resources-to-make-iphones">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/webkit_textwrap_pretty" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w94" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：//1.41800</id><published> 2025-04-09T23：11：05Z</published><updated> 2025-04-10T19：18：08Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我认为这是一个不错的开端，我对Webkit团队甚至根本无法解决这个问题感到高​​兴。正如Simmons指出的那样，到目前为止，Web浏览器中的线条包裹布局已经非常粗糙 - 并且网络已经很长时间了。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

It wraps whenever it needs, after it&#39;s fit the maximum amount of content on the previous line. If hyphenation is turned on, it will hyphenate whatever word is last on the line, at whatever point leaves as much of the word on the previous line as possible. Nothing else is taken into consideration — which is why text on the web has bad rag, rivers, short last lines, and hyphenation that makes no sense.</p><p> This is not required by the fact that text is laid out by a computer. For decades, software like Adobe InDesign and LaTeX has evaluated multiple lines of text at a time as they decide where to end one line and begin the next. It&#39;s just that the web didn&#39;t use a multiline algorithm.到目前为止。</p><p> We are excited to bring this capability to the web for the first time, in Safari Technology Preview 216.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve turned this on here at Daring Fireball, at least as an experiment. (Look at me, fast adopter of novel CSS features.) I have mixed feelings about the results. Here are saved PDFs showing the rendering of my “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/how_many_iphones_can_fit_on_a_freight_plane">How Many New iPhones Can Fit on a Freight Plane?</a> ” article from earlier today: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-iphones-on-plane-textwrap-auto.pdf">first with traditional <code>text-wrap: auto</code></a> line wrapping, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-iphones-on-plane-textwrap-pretty.pdf">second with WebKit&#39;s new <code>text-wrap: pretty</code></a> in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/">STP</a> 216. Looking at each paragraph by itself, there&#39;s no question this new layout algorithm is, well, prettier. The problem I see is going from one paragraph to another. Within a paragraph, WebKit&#39;s new <code>pretty</code> wrapping definitely makes lines a more uniform width. But in some cases it so narrows an entire paragraph that it makes going from one paragraph to the next jarring. Line-to-line the new algorithm looks better, but paragraph-to-paragraph I think it looks worse.</p><p> One specific example, from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">my longest recent article</a> . First, with the old <code>text-wrap: auto</code> :</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-something-rotten-textwrap-auto.png" class="noborder"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-something-rotten-textwrap-auto.png"
    alt="A screenshot from a recent Daring Fireball article, showing a list of 4 items."
    width = 500
    style = "border: 1px solid #5a626a;"
  /></a></p><p> Here&#39;s that same list with the new <code>text-wrap: pretty</code> in STP 216:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-something-rotten-textwrap-pretty.png" class="noborder"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-something-rotten-textwrap-pretty.png"
    alt="A screenshot of the same section from the same recent article as the previous screenshot, but in this one, one of the list item paragraphs is noticeably wider than the others."
    width = 500
    border = 1
    style = "border: 1px solid #5a626a;"
  /></a></p><p> With the new <code>text-wrap: pretty</code> , the entire paragraph for the first list item is noticeably wider than the subsequent ones (and noticeably wider than the one preceding the list). To me, there&#39;s so much disparity between paragraph widths that it&#39;s distracting, even though each paragraph, taken on its own, looks better. But you don&#39;t take paragraphs on their own when reading.</p><p> I suspect (informed by toying with <a href="https://codepen.io/jensimmons/full/xxvoqNM">Simmons&#39;s fun interactive demo page</a> using STP 216) that this initial WebKit <code>text-wrap: pretty</code> layout algorithm works better with wider column widths than are currently specified on Daring Fireball. When there&#39;s a little more width to play with, there seems to be less back-and-forth change from paragraph to paragraph.</p><p> So, for my purposes, this might be yet another improvement that will need to wait for the long-promised-but-who-knows-when-it-might-actually-happen-but-I-swear-I-think-about-it-quite-a-bit-and-a-few-years-ago-even-had-something-in-motion-but-then-let-the-project-drop layout modernization here. But, even with a nice responsive design, column widths on phones are inherently narrow, so I think this algorithm ought to be tweaked to render more consistent paragraph widths in narrow-ish columns.</p><p> But I think it&#39;s a good start, and I couldn&#39;t be happier that the WebKit team is even tackling the problem at all. As Simmons notes, line-wrapping layout in web browsers has, until now, been very crude — and the web has been around a long time.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ WebKit Adds Support for &#39;text-wrap: pretty&#39;, Now Shipping in Safari Technology Preview </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/how_many_iphones_can_fit_on_a_freight_plane" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w93" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41799</id><published> 2025-04-09T20:46:55Z</published><updated> 2025-04-09T21:19:01Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> This sounds like one of those puzzles job interviewers often ask, but there&#39;s a practical relevance at the moment. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>This sounds like one of those puzzles job interviewers often ask, but there&#39;s a practical relevance at the moment: What&#39;s a ballpark estimate for how many iPhones Apple might have hustled to ship into the US <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/08/plane-of-iphones-from-india-and-china">on those five freight planes</a> ahead of the new tariffs? <a href="https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1909770872778338793">Ryan Jones tackled it in a post on X</a> :</p><blockquote><p> A whopping 12 days of sales.最多。</p><p>数学：<br /> • B747 Freighter carries 300,000 lbs<br /> • boxed iPhone is 0.9 lbs<br /> = 350K iPhones per plane</p></blockquote><p> I like Jones&#39;s ballpark math here. Let&#39;s not worry about volume, just weight. If we&#39;re wrong about the volume, it can only mean <em>fewer</em> new-in-box iPhones can fit per plane. There&#39;s no way to (safely) exceed <a href="https://www.cargolux.com/fleet-equipment/aircraft/747-8f-specifications/">the weight limit of a plane</a> .</p><p> Jones also estimates that Apple sells about 150,000 new iPhones in the US per day, at least in the typical April–June quarter — which I concur is a good ballpark figure. <sup id="fnr1-2025-04-09"><a href="#fn1-2025-04-09">1</a></sup> So each plane can carry a little over two days&#39; worth of US domestic iPhones. That means <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/how-apple-flew-5-flights-full-of-iphones-from-india-and-china-in-3-days-to-beat-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120044321.cms">if the Times of India is correct</a> that Apple “transported five planes full of iPhones and other products from India to the US in just three days during the final week of March”, those five planes combined carried, at the most, about 12 days&#39; worth of new US iPhones.</p><p> Now that&#39;s just from India. And those are just the five planes the Times of India heard about. It seems safe to presume Apple might have hustled even more planes out of China and Vietnam. But again, at most, each plane full of Apple products carries about two days&#39; worth of products. We did our napkin math using iPhones, but “1 full plane = 2 days of inventory” can&#39;t be far off the mark, no matter what the mix of product is in each plane&#39;s cargo hold.</p><p> 350,000 iPhones packed onto a single plane is a lot of iPhones. Sending a few million units across a dozen (or more!) planes is, quite literally, tons of iPhones. But Apple sells about <em>50 tons</em> of new iPhones in the US alone every day. We all know that Apple&#39;s iPhone business is huge. But when you start to consider it in practical terms like this it&#39;s just staggering.</p><p> There&#39;s no way Apple can “beat” these Trump tariffs by having shipped products ahead of their taking effect. Could they hedge against two or three weeks of tumult? Maybe a month, tops? Yes, and it seems like maybe that&#39;s what they did. But no matter how many planes they filled — or how many container ships they might have had the foresight to send a month or two ago — there are very practical limits to inventory, too. Apple&#39;s warehouses are likely designed with one or two weeks of inventory in mind. You can&#39;t just rent random warehouse space to hold billions of dollars worth of iPhones.</p><p> <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2011/08/24/technology/cook_apple.fortune/index.htm">From Adam Lashinsky&#39;s 2008 profile of Tim Cook for Fortune</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Almost from the time he showed up at Apple, Cook knew he had to pull the company out of manufacturing. He closed factories and warehouses around the world and instead established relationships with contract manufacturers. As a result, Apple&#39;s inventory, measured by the amount of time it sat on the company&#39;s balance sheet, quickly fell from months to days. Inventory, Cook has said, is “fundamentally evil,” and he has been known to observe that it declines in value by 1% to 2% a week in normal times, faster in tough times like the present.</p><p> “You kind of want to manage it like you&#39;re in the dairy business,” he has said. “If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem.”</p></blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s entire supply chain is rightly heralded as genius, a triumph of everything from component sourcing to assembly to transport. But the entire operation is premised on the continuous free flow of packaged products out of China. Apple never holds much inventory, of anything, anywhere in the world.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-04-09"><p> If anything, Apple&#39;s sales might be higher than usual right now. With consumers worried that Apple (and everyone else) might raise prices in response to Trump&#39;s tariffs at any moment, demand is surely up to some extent. I know two friends who&#39;ve already purchased new MacBooks, now, for kids who aren&#39;t going off to college until September. <a href="#fnr1-2025-04-09"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★有多少个新iPhone可以在货运飞机上适合？</title></entry><entry><title>特朗普将大多数关税降低到10％，但将中国的关税提高到125％ </title><link href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114309144289505174" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w92" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/trump-cuts-most-tariffs-to-10-but-increases-tariffs-on-china-to-125" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41798</id><published> 2025-04-09T18:56:08Z</published><updated> 2025-04-09T19:49:32Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Joanna Stern, Adrienne Tong, and Nicole Nguyen, writing for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AZx1sTNZuRg-d7hf8O69F5A">News+</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Take a look at this iPhone 16 Pro. Your cost, for the 256GB version, is $1,100. The cost of all the hardware inside — aka the bill of materials — was about $550 to Apple when the phone was introduced, says Wayne Lam, research analyst at TechInsights, which breaks down major products. Throw in assembly and testing and Apple&#39;s cost rises to around $580. Even when you account for Apple&#39;s advertising budget and all the included services — iMessage, iCloud, etc. — there&#39;s still a healthy profit margin.</p><p> Now factor in the newly announced tariff for goods from China, which currently totals 54%. The cost rises to around $850. That profit margin would shrink dramatically if Apple didn&#39;t up the price. And you don&#39;t become a trillion-dollar gadget company by charging for things at cost.</p></blockquote><p> Also worth a look is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/wsj-front-page-5-april-2025.jpeg">today&#39;s front page of the WSJ print edition</a> .

<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> In his piece, Gruber particularly calls out the trashcan Mac Pro sticking at $2999 throughout its existence, but I think an even more striking example is the iMac. Introduced in 1998 at a base price of $1299, today&#39;s infinitely more powerful iMac M4 starts at … $1299.</p><p> Granted, with inflation, those prices would be a little different. In researching the details, I came across <a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/iMac-price-history">this great piece from PerfectRec</a> charting the iMac&#39;s price history over the years, including adjusting for inflation. Impressively, while the iMac&#39;s base price has dipped as low as $1099 in all that time, it&#39;s never gone <em>over</em> $1299.</p></blockquote><p> What a great example.

Moore&#39;s Law makes computers very strange manufactured goods. A Honda Civic LX cost about $15,000 in 1998, but now costs about $25,000. BMW 3-series sedans went from around $30,000 to $45,000.

<p>Barbara Moens and Henry Foy, reporting from Brussels for the Financial Times <em>last</em> Friday, March 28:</p><blockquote><p> The EU is set to impose minimal fines on Apple and Facebook owner Meta next week under its Digital Markets Act, as Brussels seeks to avoid escalating tensions with US President Donald Trump.</p><p> According to people familiar with the decisions, the iPhone maker is expected to be fined and ordered to revise its App Store rules, following an investigation into whether they prevent app developers from sending consumers to offers outside its platform. Regulators will also close another investigation into Apple, which was focused on the company&#39;s design of its web browser choice screen without any further sanctions.</p><p> Meta will also be fined and ordered to change its “pay or consent” model which forces users to either consent to data tracking or pay a subscription fee for an ad-free experience of its products.</p></blockquote><p> The FT is usually the go-to source for leaked news from the European Commission. But “next week” came and went with no announcements made. Maybe the FT just had a bad source, or maybe there was some sort of unforeseen delay? Or maybe the EC looked at the chaos unleashed by Trump this week and figured these fines could wait another week. Or maybe they&#39;re just recalculating the fines post-trade-war.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Perhaps the E.U.

<p>Tom Warren, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Microsoft held a special 50th anniversary event at its headquarters earlier today. During Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman&#39;s presentation, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">Microsoft employee interrupted the event</a> to protest the use of Microsoft&#39;s technologies in Israel&#39;s war against Hamas. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643777/microsoft-bill-gates-steve-ballmer-satya-nadella-employee-protestor">A second employee interrupted the event later on</a> , while CEO Satya Nadella, co-founder Bill Gates, and former CEO Steve Ballmer were discussing 50 years of Microsoft.</p></blockquote><p> The only opinionated <em>public</em> takes I&#39;ve seen on these two protestors are from political extremes: a small number of people cheering them on, and another small number of people angrily decrying them as terrorist sympathizers. I suspect most people, though, have a take closer to my own, but are unwilling to espouse it lest they risk the ire of the two aforementioned political extremes.我会尽力。</p><p> There&#39;s a time and a place for everything, and Microsoft&#39;s own 50th anniversary celebration was not the time or place for two insufferable self-involved showboats to make the event about them. Because that&#39;s what this was. It was about them, personally. Not about Gaza or Israel.</p><p> The place for righteous protests is in public, in the streets — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/05/hands-off-protests-trump-administration">exactly as they are happening across the United States today</a> .</p><p> Of <em>course</em> Microsoft conducts business in Israel and with the Israeli government. They&#39;re Microsoft — the entire point of the company (and thus the core point of the 50th anniversary celebration) is that their software is ubiquitous. Ranked by GDP, Israeli&#39;s economy is 29th in the world. If Microsoft employees really want to make the case that the company should sever all ties to Israel, go ahead, but performance stunts at public celebrations are not the way. Why do they even work for Microsoft if they&#39;re not happy to celebrate the company&#39;s own 50th anniversary? Why did Microsoft hire people who seemingly despise the very company they work for?</p><p> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard but there&#39;s a lot of horrible shit going on around the world right now. Should Microsoft sever all ties to Republican-led states that have made women&#39;s reproductive healthcare illegal? ( <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-arrest-miscarriage-fetal-personhood-rcna199400">A woman in Georgia was just arrested after suffering a miscarriage</a> .) Should Microsoft sever all ties to the US federal government, which is now led by a mad tyrant who, in plain sight, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/what-the-january-6th-report-is-missing">attempted to overthrow an election he lost</a> , and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752">now claims</a> (shocking no one) to be considering running for a third term that <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/">even a child could understand to be plainly unconstitutional</a> ? How much Microsoft software does ICE use? Or DOGE?</p><p> Where do such protests — all in the name of just causes — stop?</p><p> In the midst of all this madness and chaos — much of it already horrific, more of it suggestive of foreboding horrors to come — we need more than ever to savor, to appreciate, what&#39;s still good about the world. Microsoft is a great American company. What a remarkable gift of good luck, good health, brilliant strategy, successful execution, steady leadership, and the right circumstances (eg Bill Gates&#39;s precocious age — 19! — at the company&#39;s founding) that the company has had only three CEOs in its half-century history and all three were available to join each other on stage to celebrate this anniversary, and the company&#39;s still-bright future.</p><p> What a shitty thing to do it was to try to spoil this.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Microsoft’s 50th Birthday Was Interrupted, Twice, by Employees Protesting Against Israel’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/05/microsoft-50-employee-protests">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>事实是，这些不是很聪明的人</title><link href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/donald-trumps-ego-melts-the-global-economy" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/glasser-trump-ego" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41787</id><published> 2025-04-04T23:56:21Z</published><updated> 2025-04-04T23:56:21Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Susan Glasser, writing for The New Yorker, “Donald Trump&#39;s Ego Melts the Global Economy”:</p><blockquote><p> In this new political moment of the unthinkable made manifest, the sheer power rush for Trump should also not be underestimated. Imagine his joy as he sat down to sign an executive order decreeing the new tariffs on the basis of sweeping powers he may or may not legally possess to declare a “national economic emergency” — here was Trump transforming the world with a single flourish of his Sharpie pen. “It&#39;s such an honor to be finally able to do this,” he said. At what other moment in modern times has a single man wielded so much unaccountable power over such a large swath of the world economy? There are whole businesses devoted to risk analysis for corporations; this is a situation in which Trump himself is the risk and the crisis being analyzed is one that he created. Talk about an ego trip.</p></blockquote><p> Glasser links to <a href="https://x.com/Kasparov63/status/1907798003236188169">Garry Kasparov, on X</a> , responding to Wall Street&#39;s collective surprise that Trump did what he&#39;s been saying he would do re: tariff policy:</p><blockquote><p> As I&#39;ve said for years about Putin, and which applies to other autocratic personalities like Trump: “Dictators always lie about what they&#39;ve done, but are often quite plain about what they want to do.” “Trump would never...” is the new “Putin would never...”</p><p> Such people do and take whatever they can, unless they are stopped. That they don&#39;t always succeed does not mean they were not sincere in their ambitions and won&#39;t keep trying to fulfill them. Trump has only been emboldened by the sycophantic GOP this time around.</p></blockquote><p> Even more apt, “Deep Throat” explaining the central truth of the Watergate scandal to Bob Woodward in the Alan-Pakula-directed / William-Goldman-written film adaptation of <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/891-all-the-president-s-men?language=en-US">All the President&#39;s Men</a></em> :</p><blockquote><p> “Forget the myths the media has created about the White House.

<p>CNBC：</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump on Friday extended a deadline requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the US operations of TikTok or face an effective ban in the country, marking the second time he has taken such action.</p></blockquote><p> Trump, on Truth Social, which is by far the most popular social network in the world:</p><blockquote><p> My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days. We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the USA!). This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security! We do not want TikTok to “go dark.” We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.感谢您对此事的关注！</p></blockquote><p> Those are the remarks of the most powerful man in the world.</p><p> Keep in mind, too, that there is no mechanism in the law for the president to issue any such extension. What he&#39;s saying is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">what he said the last time</a> : he&#39;s instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi not to enforce the law, and pinky-swearing that US companies that are breaking the law to keep TikTok available (Akamai, Oracle, Google, Apple) <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/my_spitball_theory_on_tiktoks_current_semi-reprieve_in_the_us">won&#39;t be held responsible for it</a> .

<p>Akash Sriram, reporting for Reuters under the headline “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/will-trump-tariffs-make-apple-iphones-more-expensive-2025-04-03/">A $2,300 Apple iPhone? Trump Tariffs Could Make That Happen.</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.</p><p> Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.</p></blockquote><p> Apple shares dropped <em>another</em> 7.3% percent today. Apple alone has lost 16.6% of its value in the last 48 hours; the S&amp;P 500 dropped 10%.</p><blockquote><p> The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the US with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% — if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers. A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s under-remarked upon, but Apple, to a point of almost obstinance, considers pricing part of the brand for its products. They tend not to raise or lower prices with the ebbs and flows of the world economy or even the obvious constraints of simple supply and demand. Throughout the entire COVID crisis, I don&#39;t recall them changing their prices for anything.</p><p> As an extreme example, consider the trashcan Mac Pro. It was introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/06/10Apple-Gives-Sneak-Peek-Into-the-Future-of-the-Pro-Desktop/">at WWDC 2013</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/10/23Introducing-the-All-New-Mac-Pro-The-Most-Radical-Mac-Ever/">shipped in December that year</a> with a starting price of $2,999.

Then in April 2017 Apple held <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">that highly unusual small roundtable meeting</a> — invitees were just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/apple-pushes-the-reset-button-on-the-mac-pro/">Matthew Panzarino</a> , <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/04/apple-reveals-mac-pro-imac-plans/">Lance Ulanoff</a> , <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-to-ditch-the-current-mac-pro-design-but-replacement-wont-arrive--2343465726.html">Ina Fried</a> , <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-says-it-is-completely-rethinking-the-mac-pro">John Paczkowski</a> , and yours truly — to discuss “completely rethinking the Mac Pro”. They issued small speed bumps to the trashcan Mac Pro that day, but didn&#39;t ship the actual completely-rethought Mac Pro <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/">until WWDC 2019</a> . The starting price never changed from $2,999, even when demand for the trashcan models had clearly dropped to near zero. The price was part of the brand. (The starting price for the 2019 Mac Pro: $5,999.)</p><p> Or consider <em>today’s</em> Mac Pro, with the M2 Ultra. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-unveils-new-mac-studio-and-brings-apple-silicon-to-mac-pro/">It debuted alongside Mac Studio models that also came with the M2 Ultra</a> at WWDC 2023 almost two years ago. M2 Ultra Mac Studios <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/06/m2-ultra-mac-studio-review-top-of-the-line/">started at $3,999</a> ; Mac Pros at $6,999. Many observers, quite reasonably, questioned the $3,000 price difference when both computers offered the same chips. The 2023 Mac Pro, in some sense, is just a 2023 Mac Studio in a much bigger case with additional high-performance I/O options. But a month ago Apple debuted <em>M3</em> Ultra Mac Studios, with an unchanged starting price of $3,999. The Mac Pro, still equipped with the older M2 Ultra, still starts at $6,999. Which means that for the time being, you&#39;re not paying $3,000 extra for the same computer in a bigger case, but for a <em>generation-older</em> computer in a bigger case.</p><p> Presumably, M3 Ultra Mac Pros are coming soon, perhaps at WWDC. But until then, the pricing is undeniably weird when compared to the Mac Studio — and many people have thought the pricing was a bit weird compared to the Mac Studio when they were offered with the same M2-generation chips. But that&#39;s how Apple likes to do pricing: they set a price when a product is announced, and that price never changes until a successor to that product is announced.</p><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-techdirt">erratic</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two">illogical</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/the-economist-on-trumps-mindless-tariffs">nonsensical</a> nature of Trump&#39;s tariffs is bad for everyone. ( <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crampell.bsky.social/post/3llzc3fmf7s23">Understatement</a> .) But it&#39;s particularly troublesome for a company that sees retail price stability as part of the branding for its products. Will Trump come to his senses (to some small degree), and declare a nonexistent victory next week and pull these tariffs from the board? Or stick to his guns and ride this global-economy-tanking insanity out?没人知道。 Will he start granting exceptions?没人知道。 So in addition to being nonsensical, the whole thing is entirely unpredictable, which is not at all compatible with the way Apple has set retail prices for decades.</p><p> My (bigly) guess is that Apple will inject its own predictability and stability into the mix, and keep its retail prices stable, for now, and take the tariff hit on its margins.

<p>Mike Isaac, writing for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Apple, Dell, Oracle — which rely on hardware and global supply chains that are in the direct line of fire from tariffs — saw their shares go into free-fall. But there was another big tech company whose stock took a pummeling even though its core business has little to do with hardware: Meta. [...]</p><p> The effect of tariffs on Meta&#39;s ad business is simple. Many of its small and medium-sized advertisers are from all across the world. President Trump&#39;s tariffs will instantly make it more expensive for them to sell their products to customers in the United States. [...]</p><p> Last year, the company disclosed that 10 percent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/business/google-meta-temu-shein.html">its revenue in 2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily</a> on advertising across Facebook and Instagram, an ad blitz aimed at garnering a foothold in lucrative Western markets.</p><p> Much of that growth was fueled by the explosive expansion of the fast-fashion company Shein — which is based in Singapore but has a supply chain that is largely in China — and the e-commerce app Temu, a low-cost, Amazon-like company owned by the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Pinduoduo. Temu was estimated to have spent $3 billion in marketing costs in 2023 alone, according to estimates from Bernstein Research.</p></blockquote><p> When the stock market began crumbling after Trump&#39;s announcement Wednesday, I didn&#39;t get why Meta was being hit so hard. Meta makes devices, but unlike Apple, that&#39;s just a side hustle. Meta isn&#39;t a retailer like Amazon. But Meta <em>is</em> a huge advertising destination for retailers. It&#39;s all interconnected.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-meta">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>任天堂延迟开关2预先订购关税问题</title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-over-tariff-concerns" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41781</id><published> 2025-04-04T17:19:53Z</published><updated> 2025-04-04T17:19:53Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Allison McDaniel, writing for 9to5Mac back in 2022:</p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a> is a virtual debit card where you can send and receive money through iMessage. Stored in your Wallet, you can make secure and contactless payments with Apple Pay from your iPhone or Apple Watch. It&#39;s also a way to receive daily cash back for those who use Apple Card.

<p>I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">observed yesterday</a> that, in general, Visa and Mastercard credit cards are both accepted at the same locations.

<p>Bill Gates, commemorating Microsoft&#39;s 50th anniversary:</p><blockquote><p> The story of how Microsoft came to be begins with, of all things, a magazine. The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured an Altair 8800 on the cover. The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics company called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal computer kit that promised to bring computing power to hobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two things: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted to get in on the ground floor.</p><p> At the time, personal computers were practically non-existent. Paul and I knew that creating software that let people program the Altair could revolutionize the way people interacted with these machines. So, we reached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS, and told him we had a version of the programming language BASIC for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p><p> There was just one problem: We didn&#39;t.<br/> It was time to get to work.</p></blockquote><p> At the bottom Gates links to a printout of the original source code for the BASIC interpreter, in extensively commented assembly language.

<p>Wonderfully detailed write-up of a perfect prop from Make3:</p><blockquote><p> Repurposed Nagra Knobs &amp; Switches — To ground the device in a tangible, vintage aesthetic, we salvaged original knobs and switches from a 1990s Nagra IV-D recorder, seamlessly integrating them into our design. These components not only provided an authentic look and feel but also remained fully functional, with:</p><ul><li> A power switch for system activation.</li><li> A reading on/off switch to engage or disable the Woe display.</li><li> A manual override switch to cycle through needle positions if wireless control failed.</li></ul></blockquote><p> When I watched this episode, I remember noticing how cool the device seemed.

<p>Jason Snell, last month:</p><blockquote><p> The new M4 MacBook Air is the Mac most people should buy. [...]</p><p> That&#39;s why perhaps the most important change in the M4 MacBook Air is its base configuration, which starts at $999. When Apple introduced a winning new flat-with-rounded-corners Air design in 2022, it had to keep selling older models in order to get down under a thousand dollars. Three years later, Apple is finally able to sell a brand-new Air — with a generous 16GB of unified memory — at that important price.</p><p> So: No more quibbles about stepping back a generation or two to an older model with a lower price. Apple has done away with that strategy for the MacBook Air: The latest and greatest model is the one most people shopping for a Mac should buy, especially if they&#39;re coming from an Intel model.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d put off linking to Snell&#39;s review for a few weeks while thinking about writing my own, but I&#39;ve got nothing to add. The M4 MacBook Air is utterly unsurprising, but only in the best possible way. It&#39;s the MacBook Air everyone wanted Apple to make. The $999 base model is now exceedingly recommendable. It even brings back the most notable feature that was lost in the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon — the ability to drive two external displays <em>and</em> its own internal display. Just aces all around.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell’s M4 MacBook Air Review’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/snell-m4-macbook-air">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> US Transaction Shares for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/visa-wanted-a-vast-empire-first-it-had-to-beat-back-its-foes-3b3067f3?mod=article_inline" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41775</id><published> 2025-04-03T23:34:50Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T23:35:02Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">the previous item</a> , here&#39;s a WSJ report from October on Visa&#39;s dominant position in the payments industry:</p><blockquote><p> Visa, based in San Francisco, has built its network over more than 60 years — going back to clunky manual credit-card readers and carbon-paper copies of receipts. It accounts for around 60% of the total dollar amount of US debit-card purchases and about 50% of US credit-card purchases, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication. Its closest competitor, Mastercard, accounts for around 22% and 23%, respectively. Visa&#39;s profit totaled $17.3 billion in its 2023 fiscal year, after more than tripling in the last decade.</p></blockquote><p> Amex accounts for about 19% of US credit card transactions (and doesn&#39;t support debit), and Discover is down around 3 or 4%. I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it&#39;s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘U.S. Transaction Shares for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WSJ: Visa Offers Apple Roughly $100 Million to Switch Apple Card&#39;s Network From Mastercard </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-card-visa-mastercard-deal-3ce762da" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41774</id><published> 2025-04-03T23:15:38Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T23:28:09Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AMIc70z-kQ4-ghz686tbG3Q">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The Apple card is up for grabs because Goldman Sachs, the bank behind it, is getting out of the consumer lending world. For months, big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial have been vying to take over as issuer. What hasn&#39;t been known is the equally fierce fight playing out between the networks to win Apple, with Visa and American Express trying to unseat Mastercard, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p> Apple is expected to select a network for the card before it picks the bank to replace Goldman Sachs. Networks provide the plumbing that transmit information between the banks that issue consumers&#39; cards and the merchants&#39; banks.</p><p> Visa, the largest network, has made an aggressive pitch to win the card, including offering the kind of upfront payment to Apple that&#39;s normally reserved for the biggest card programs, the people said. Visa offered a similar payment when Costco was selecting its network about a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p> American Express is also in the mix, trying to become both the issuer and network of the Apple card, the people said. Goldman had approached Amex to gauge its interest in taking over the card in 2023, the Journal earlier reported.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve always thought Visa and Mastercard were interchangeable.

<p>Mike Masnick has a great piece at TechDirt running down just how <em>stupid</em> everything about Trump&#39;s tariff trade war is:</p><blockquote><p> Whoever on the Council of Economic Advisers used this formula should turn in their econ degree, because this is not how anything works. Even if they then go on to <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations">publish another version</a> of the formula that looks all sophisticated and shit.</p></blockquote><p> Brendan Duke, on X, shows that the fancier version of their formula — which is fancy in the way that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/vertu-still-selling-phones">Vertu phones</a> are “fancy” — <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1907741651172311353">is even stupider</a> , because the two Greek letters they chose to glam it up just cancel each other out.</p><p> Back to Masnick:</p><blockquote><p> This is what happens when you ask ChatGPT to “make my wrong econ math look more scientific.” The document even admits that they couldn&#39;t figure out the actual tariff rates, so they “proxied” them with this formula instead. That&#39;s a bit like saying you couldn&#39;t find your house keys, so you proxied them with a banana.</p><p> The fundamental problem here isn&#39;t just that the tariff numbers are wrong — though they absolutely are. It&#39;s that the entire premise rests on treating trade deficits as if they were tariffs. They&#39;re not the same thing.根本。</p><p> Let&#39;s back up for a moment and talk about trade deficits, because Trump has been getting this wrong for longer than some of his supporters have been alive. His logic appears to be:</p><ol><li> “Deficit” sounds bad</li><li> Therefore, trade deficits must be bad</li><li> Therefore, countries with whom we have trade deficits must be cheating us</li><li> Therefore, we should punish them with tariffs to “level the playing field”</li></ol></blockquote><p> This sounds like it must be an exaggeration for comic effect, but it&#39;s not. That&#39;s how Trump&#39;s mind works. This is what Trump has been <em>saying</em> about trade deficits for decades.

<p>The Economist:</p><blockquote><p> On economics Mr Trump&#39;s assertions are flat-out nonsense. The president says tariffs are needed to close America&#39;s trade deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet as any of the president&#39;s economists could have told him, this overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than their country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for over three decades.没有理由为什么他的额外关税应该消除赤字。 Insisting on balanced trade with every trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that each of its suppliers is also a customer.</p><p> And Mr Trump&#39;s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a country&#39;s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks as if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes America&#39;s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported from each country and halves it — which is almost as random as taxing you on the number of vowels in your name.</p></blockquote><p> There is no way to report on these tariffs in a way that is honest and accurate without describing them as bonkers and nonsensical. News publications that are trying to present them as rational, or describing them as “reciprocal” just because that&#39;s the word the White House is using, <a href="https://presswatchers.org/2025/04/mainstream-media-falls-for-trumps-insane-reciprocal-tariff-talk/">are beclowning themselves</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Economist on Trump’s Mindless Tariffs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/the-economist-on-trumps-mindless-tariffs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>特朗普关税，第二天</title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-live-updates-stock-market-trade-war.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41771</id><published> 2025-04-03T19:22:23Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T21:01:34Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Amazon and Meta were both down 9%. Nike is down over 13%. From CNBC&#39;s corresponding story on just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">how the White House computed the “tariff” rates</a> it claims for various countries:</p><blockquote><p> Many observers said the US appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.</p><p> Such methodology doesn&#39;t necessarily align with the conventional approach for calculating tariffs and implies the US would have looked at only the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.</p></blockquote><p> “Such methodology doesn&#39;t necessarily align with the conventional approach” is an overlong euphemism for “The president literally doesn&#39;t understand what tariffs are.” James Surowiecki was seemingly <a href="https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1907559189234196942">the first person to figure out the White House&#39;s nonsensical formula</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Just figured out where these fake tariff rates come from. They didn&#39;t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country&#39;s exports to us.</p><p> So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.

<p>Jon Brodkin, reporting for Ars Technica, “ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/france-fines-apple-e150m-for-excessive-pop-ups-that-let-users-reject-tracking/">France Fines Apple €150M for “Excessive” Pop-Ups That Let Users Reject Tracking</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> France&#39;s competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying the iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up messages that let users consent to or reject tracking that third-party applications use for targeted advertising.</p><p> The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue, said a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">press release</a> today by the Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system harms “smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,” the agency said.</p><p> User consent obtained via the ATT framework “authorizes the application in question to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes,” the agency said. “If consent is given, the application can access the Identifier for Advertisers (&#39;IDFA&#39;), the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use of third-party applications and sites.” The French investigation was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry associations.</p></blockquote><p> Ben Lovejoy, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/31/apple-bizarrely-fined-162m-for-app-tracking-transparency-after-advertisers-complained/">correctly calling the decision “bizarre” at 9to5Mac</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Complaints were made <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/apple-app-tracking/">in a number of countries</a> — some arguing that it was unfair because <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/14/app-tracking-transparency-antitrust/">Apple exempts its own apps</a> (which are in reality subject to even tighter controls), others saying the loss of revenue <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/13/app-tracking-transparency-increases-in-app-purchase-prices/">forced developers to raise prices</a> to compensate. [...]</p><p> Although expected, the decision is still inexplicable. ATT involves precisely <em>one</em> popup asking a simple yes/no question. Additionally, Apple lets users switch on a toggle (shown above) to block apps from even asking the question. It&#39;s especially odd given that ATT is a privacy feature, and Europe has the strongest privacy laws in the world. The EU <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/03/ad-tracking-rules/">has also previously vindicated</a> Apple&#39;s introduction of ATT.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s not inexplicable or odd if you view the decision as coming from a perspective where government bureaucracy is viewed as an inherent good, and well-intentioned process is all that matters, not actual results. Read the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> ’s decision ( <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">which they helpfully do make available in English</a> ) and it&#39;s pretty clear:</p><blockquote><p> The <em>Autorité</em> found that the ATT framework imposed by Apple is not necessary, insofar as the consent obtained is not valid under the applicable laws, in particular the French Data Protection Act.</p><p> In practice, the fact that publishers that so wish cannot rely on the ATT framework to comply with their legal obligations means that they must continue to use their own consent collection solutions, known as consent management platforms (“CMPs”). The result is that multiple consent pop-ups are displayed, making the use of third-party applications in the iOS environment excessively complex, as observed by the French data protection authority ( <em>Commission nationale de l&#39;informatique et des libertés</em> — CNIL) in a 2022 opinion issued at the request of the <em>Autorité</em> .</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s ostensibly “not necessary” because French and EU privacy laws are supposedly enough, and all that&#39;s needed. And it&#39;s unfair because now, under ATT, third-party surveillance advertisers who seek to track users across apps on iOS need to ask permission twice — first through the clear-as-a-bell “Ask App Not to Track” / “Allow Tracking” prompt required by Apple, and again through the byzantine but ultimately toothless permission requirements of France and the EU. ATT has had measurable effects because users understand it, and they prefer not to be tracked. EU and French privacy laws are largely ineffective because, in practice, they <a href="https://hep.physics.illinois.edu/home/g-gollin/1984_commercial_dialogue.html">bury users with confusion</a> . The bureaucratic hurdles they impose are to the benefit, not detriment, of the surveillance ad industry. That&#39;s now proven out by industry groups — the ones ATT successfully tempered — successfully getting France&#39;s regulators to penalize Apple. <em>Users</em> don&#39;t know how to lobby government bureaucracies. What the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> is saying, in so many words, is that two layers of consent is too much, and the only one that&#39;s necessary is the one that advertising lobbying groups <em>don&#39;t object to</em> , not the one they do (but which users understand and like).</p><p> It&#39;s clear that only one of these two things — Apple&#39;s ATT or French/EU privacy regulations — was actually effective at reducing tracking: ATT. No one claimed that French or EU privacy laws resulted in Meta losing a fortune because they had to adjust their kleptomaniacal thievery of users&#39; privacy. But by all accounts, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/">including Meta&#39;s own</a> , <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/04/23/apple-just-issued-stunning-12-billion-blow-to-facebook/">ATT cost Meta billions</a> . And yes, ATT hurt small businesses too — small businesses that were built upon surreptitious tracking that users had neither awareness of nor control over. It&#39;s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a popular retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers&#39; business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.</p><p> App Tracking Transparency actually accomplished, in practice, via user-focused plain-language consent, what the EU&#39;s privacy laws were intended to do but do not. This fine boils down to France declaring that Apple shouldn&#39;t have actually done what the EU was pretending to do. They&#39;re acting at the behest of the very developers and advertising companies who were (and still are) trying to conduct cross-app tracking that App Tracking Transparency successfully gave <em>users</em> some control over.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★法国将Apple罚款1.62亿美元用于应用程序跟踪透明度，将监视广告商的一面胜过用户</title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/the_studio" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7z" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41759</id><published> 2025-03-30T19:38:28Z</published><updated> 2025-03-31T15:31:36Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Perhaps Apple&#39;s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but *champions*. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>With season 2 of <em>Severance</em> complete (with a remarkable bang), Apple TV+ has slid right into a new prestige series, <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/247767-the-studio?language=en-US">The Studio</a></em> , starring (and co-created by) Seth Rogen as the newly-appointed chief of the fictional and dysfunctional Continental Studios in Hollywood.</p><p> Two episodes in (out of 10 for the debut season), and it is fucking amazing. So far it feels a bit like a cross between <em>Entourage</em> , <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em> , <em>Boogie Nights</em> , and maybe a touch of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> . But the biggest influence and inspiration is clearly Robert Altman&#39;s 1992 masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10403-the-player?language=en-US">The Player</a></em> , almost certainly the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood moviemaking that ever was or will be made.</p><p> What <em>The Studio</em> and <em>The Player</em> share is that they&#39;re about the struggle to create great cinematic art within a corporate studio world run by unartistic know-it-all self-important status-obsessed dullards driven by formula and fads — and, simultaneously, they are themselves almost unfathomably complicated and intricate works of cinematic art. They <em>are</em> what they&#39;re <em>about</em> . They achieve what the characters within them fear is no longer achievable. When you get to episode 2 of <em>The Studio</em> , just keep asking yourself “Wait, <em>how</em> are they getting this shot?” The lighting, my god. The whole thing is just an outpouring of homage to <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/opening-shots-the-player">the opening shot of <em>The Player</em></a> , which of course itself calls back, <a href="https://filmotomy.com/quiet-on-the-set-breaking-down-the-opening-shot-in-altmans-the-player/">explicitly</a> , to Orson Welles&#39;s <em>Touch of Evil</em> .</p><p> <em>The Studio</em> is, thus far, engaging, surprising, funny, gorgeous, clever, and cinematically ambitious. It&#39;s really quite a thing. I have no idea what&#39;s coming in episodes 3–10, so maybe this piece will look a bit premature, if not foolish, in two months. But if the rest of season one is anything like the first two episodes, <em>The Studio</em> is a classic in the making.</p><p> The thought also occurs to me that this might be the don&#39;t-over-think-it answer to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost">just what the hell Apple is doing making original shows and movies</a> in the first place. Perhaps Apple&#39;s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but <em>champions</em> . And that in a media landscape where such champions of cinema-as-art and art-as-an-essential-public-good are fewer and fewer, it is Apple&#39;s not just opportunity but <em>obligation</em> to step up to the plate.</p><p> I&#39;ve long thought that one of the minor tragedies of Steve Jobs&#39;s second act is that the timing just didn&#39;t work out to sell Pixar to Apple, instead of to Disney. But make no mistake, a love and appreciation for great cinema is not outside Apple&#39;s DNA. No streamer has a higher hit rate for quality shows. Their movies mostly stink so far, but maybe that&#39;s just the learning curve. <em>The Gorge</em> , for example, feels like an Apple TV movie because it&#39;s so decidedly meh. Not horrible, but not good in any way beyond its intriguing elevator-pitch concept. <em>Wolfs</em> was better but still a grand disappointment given its pedigree. But when it comes to shows, no one is doing better. <em>Severance</em> deserves all its acclaim and attention, and Ben Stiller delivered a season 2 finale that&#39;s arguably the best 78 minutes of filmmaking I&#39;ve seen this decade. And <em>The Studio</em> , to me, <em>feels</em> like an Apple TV show — not because of how it looks, what it&#39;s about, or who&#39;s in it, but simply because it&#39;s so good. Netflix almost never makes shows like this. Neither does HBO now that&#39;s its been subsumed by “Max”. Peacock et al don&#39;t even try. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-30"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-30">1</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-30"><p> One more A+ recommendation: <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/219971-the-agency">The Agency</a></em> on Paramount+.

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">the iPhone X was announced alongside the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus</a> in mid-September. The iPhones 8 shipped that month, and I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">a review of the iPhones 8</a> on September 19. The iPhone X, though, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">wasn&#39;t available to order until October 27</a> , and didn&#39;t start shipping to customers until November 3. It was an unusual iPhone release cycle that year, to say the least. Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I&#39;d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo dropped, so I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">some initial impressions then</a> , but wound up not publishing my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">full review of the iPhone X</a> until December 26.</p><p> A few days later I wrote a follow-up regarding a specific new interaction design, “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">Pressing the Side Button to Confirm Payments on iPhone X</a> ”, which I began thus:</p><blockquote><p> Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from Hacker News. It&#39;s always short-lived, because for reasons I&#39;ve never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles always get blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It&#39;s apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it&#39;s a shame the articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who don&#39;t like Daring Fireball.</p><p> Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage, though, the comment threads still exist. I went through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">the Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review</a> today, and a few comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my attention.</p></blockquote><p> What I didn&#39;t mention then was that DF&#39;s buried status at HN was, at the time, a relatively new phenomenon. Hacker News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">started in early 2007</a> and for a yearslong stretch, Daring Fireball articles seemed more or less appropriately popular there. Articles that I would think would resonate with the HN readership would hit, and get what always seemed to me an appropriate number of comments. At some point in the mid-2010s though, it seemed like DF articles would get downvoted or flagged after hitting the HN front page. I&#39;d been noticing this for some time when I wrote the above in December 2017.</p><p> But even in 2017, DF articles would get active comment threads on HN occasionally. The Hacker News thread I referenced above, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">regarding my iPhone X review</a> , garnered 107 comments. In the years after that, DF articles went from being mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> hitting the HN front page (and gaining some comment traction) to pretty much <em>never</em> hitting the HN front page (and thus never gaining any comment traction). I found this curious, and I couldn&#39;t figure out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">why or how</a> this was happening — or who was doing it — but I didn&#39;t mention it much.</p><p> Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">I did mention it again in a footnote</a> , in a piece about the inexplicably poor state of Android apps from a design perspective:</p><blockquote><p> It sounds a bit conspiratorial, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">for several years now</a> it&#39;s seemed clear to me that Hacker News has Daring Fireball in some sort of graylist. It&#39;s not blacklisted, obviously, given the aforementioned <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">two</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">threads</a> about yesterday&#39;s piece, but nothing I write here ever gains any significant traction there.曾经。 And the reason there are two threads for yesterday&#39;s piece is that the first one disappeared from the home page soon after it was posted.我认为？ In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">this list of recent Hacker News threads for articles from DF</a> , going back four months, only three have more than 10 comments — and two of those are the threads from yesterday. I don&#39;t know who I pissed off there or why, but I&#39;ve never seen an explanation for this. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN commenter Michiel de Mare has quantified the apparent suppression</a> , based on the ranking of this very article. Exactly what I&#39;ve noticed for years.</p></blockquote><p> You can see this yourself right now, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the current list of recent DF articles submitted to Hacker News</a> . Most of them have 0, 1, or 2 comments. Some got up to 3. “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a> ” is the most read, most commented upon thing I&#39;ve written in a while. On Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">it got just 28 comments</a> before being shitlisted, which, I have to say, is just weird. That&#39;s one piece I&#39;d have thought would resonate with the HN audience, and make for good grist for discussion. Then, after the original thread was shitlisted, someone re-submitted it (perhaps confused that it wasn&#39;t on the HN front page). That re-submission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">got 1 comment</a> before it too fell to the mysterious shitlist reaper.</p><p> The one recent exception is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">Why Can&#39;t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</a> ”, which somehow <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">escaped the shitlist and garnered 208 comments</a> . These occasional exceptions to DF&#39;s general shitlisting at HN have always made the whole thing more mysterious to me. There&#39;s clearly no programmatic blacklisting that keeps Daring Fireball articles from being submitted, or from gaining a few comments. But once any traction occurs, <em>something</em> happens and poof, they&#39;re gone from the Hacker News front page. It certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense to me why my off-hand post griping about our inability to screenshot DRM video frames would be an order of magnitude more popular than “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino” was.</p><p> Today, though, I saw <a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">a helpful mention on Mastodon</a> that pointed me to an interesting project. An author named Michael Lynch has written a tool to quantify “ <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">the highest-ranking personal blogs of Hacker News</a> ” since HN&#39;s inception in 2007. According to Lynch&#39;s all-time listing, Daring Fireball ranks #5, which I have to say surprised me, given its years of inexplicable (or at the very least, unexplained) shitlisting status. But Lynch&#39;s tool lets you select date ranges. If you look at <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 through 2021</a> , Daring Fireball ranked #3, behind only <a href="https://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham&#39;s renowned eponymous blog</a> and Brian Krebs&#39;s excellent (and also eponymous) <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</a> . From <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 though 2013</a> , DF ranked #2, behind only Graham (who created Hacker News). But if you look at the last four years, from <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021 through 2025</a> , Daring Fireball ranks #72.</p><p> Maybe I&#39;ve lost my fastball, and I just don&#39;t write so good no more. Or maybe it&#39;s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup> But it seems to me <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">there&#39;s something fishy going on</a> . What bothers me isn&#39;t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgruber">still do</a> when one slips through the cracks. What bothers me is that it&#39;s unexplained. Which, ultimately, seems not so much censorial as just cowardly.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-26"><p> You&#39;d think there&#39;d be a certain kinship between decades-old websites, typeset in small-point Verdana, which stubbornly refuse to update their general layout and design. <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The Website That Hacker News Is Afraid to Discuss (You&#39;re Reading It)</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
