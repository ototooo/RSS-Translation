<p>Mark Wilson 在四月份为 Fast Company 撰写的一篇简介中介绍了 LoveFrom Serif 的创建，这是一个新的字体系列，由苹果非凡的 San Francisco 系列背后的许多设计师设计：</p><blockquote><p> Serifs（想想 Times New Roman）反而成为焦点，经过详尽的搜索后，LoveFrom 设计师 Antonio Cavedoni 将巴斯克维尔作为灵感来源。这种字体是每个人都见过的，所以它会很熟悉，甚至是永恒的。但它有足够的表达成分，可以存在于许多环境中。同样具有巨大吸引力的是约翰·巴斯克维尔本人的历史背景。</p><p> “约翰·巴斯克维尔作为一个人，作为一个工匠，他的痴迷和性格与我们这些 LoveFrom 的人惊人地相似，”艾夫说。 “这确实以一种非常自然的方式成为了开发我们自己的字体的起点。”</p><p>卡维多尼解释说，巴斯克维尔确实很着迷。正如我们在<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90693444/jony-ives-first-major-design-since-leaving-apple-isnt-what-youd-expect">《大地宪章》的</a>故事中所写，巴斯克维尔首先通过“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanning">日本</a>”漆器物品赚钱。当他 40 多岁的时候，他有足够的资源去专注于他对文字创作的热情。作为一名训练有素的书法家，他希望提高书籍印刷的质量。他不仅着迷于巴斯克维尔字体的设计，还着迷于各个金属“冲孔”的精心制作，这些金属“冲孔”压紧每个字母以确保印刷清晰。他甚至<a href="https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1761.htm">配制了</a>一种改进的墨水，并了解到他可以将编织纸放入热黄铜圆筒中，使其具有光泽。</p></blockquote><p>一位致力于墨水配方和纸张整理创新的字体设计师——是的，这听起来像是艾维和他的同事们志同道合的想法。</p><p>毫不奇怪，史蒂夫·乔布斯的<em>《Make Something Wonderful》</em>的全部内容（无论是网络版还是限量印刷版）都是在 LoveFrom 中排版的。在此之前，我只遇到过小剂量的 LoveFrom Serif，并且通常是在显示尺寸（如<a href="https://www.lovefrom.com/">LoveFrom 网站的主页</a>）。事实证明，作为长文本界面，它非常好——传统但独特。一般来说，大多数人认为衬线字体更正式，无衬线字体更休闲。 LoveFrom Serif 感觉像是一种友好、情感温暖的衬线，但在形式和结构上没有放弃任何基础。当然是英国人，但不知何故带有一丝加州的欢迎气息。它显然源自 Baskerville，但与 Apple 平台上<a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/">的</a>同名 Baskerville 相比，它给人一种不同的感觉，特别是在文本大小方面。</p><p>卡维多尼本周在旧金山主要公共图书馆发表了题为“<a href="https://letterformarchive.org/shop/unexpected-baskerville-the-story-of-lovefrom-serif/">意外的巴斯克维尔：塞里夫之爱的故事</a>”的演讲。令我痛苦的是错过了一场<a href="https://typo.social/@typographica/110630124570983807">看似</a>精彩的演讲，其中有值得注意的嘉宾和历史书籍，但视频录制即将于“今年晚些时候”推出。</p><p><strong>后记：</strong>我已经在这个链接上坐了几个星期了，部分原因是，好吧，我这样做，但也因为我想让阅读<em>《Make Something Wonderful》</em>的体验安定下来。对我来说，那本书是《LoveFrom》 Serif 真正的首次亮相。如果你想练习一种字体，可以在里面放一本书。在这段时间里，我多次想到<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen">我是多么想念迪恩·艾伦</a>，特别是在此，我渴望他对字体和这本书的想法。无数次重读迪恩的《 <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103090824/http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=7">二十张脸》</a></em> ，这是一本非常<a href="https://twitter.com/verbosus/status/954452524379131904">简洁和引人注目</a>的“可用文本字体的调查”，我想起他在 ITC 巴斯克维尔的条目也指向<a href="https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves">伊夫斯夫人</a>，祖扎娜·利科在 1996 年的复兴（有那么长吗？我将永远认为《Mrs Eaves》字体是一种“新”字体），迪恩这样描述它：“通过模仿凸版印刷文本中不可预测的形式来复兴巴斯克维尔，这是一项有趣但矫揉造作的实验。”</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“LoveFrom Serif”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/lovefrom-serif">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/apple_silo_twitter" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwb" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40043</id><published> 2023-06-28T22:40:39Z</published><updated> 2023-06-29T23:40:13Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">很难不认为 Twitter 失去了优质品牌广告商，并希望快速进军长视频内容，从这种“筒仓”促销中获得的收益比苹果从新发现的观众中获得的收益还要多。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1673730750095712256">Apple TV，昨天在 Twitter 上</a>：</p><blockquote><p>距离 #Silo 大结局还有 3 天。</p><p>这是第一集的全部内容。</p></blockquote><p>嵌入在该推广推文中的是整个系列的首映。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-28"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-28">1</a></sup></p><p>就本段而言，抛开围绕 Twitter 的政治，这是一个相当有趣的促销举措。您可以在 Apple TV 应用中免费观看所有 Apple TV+ 原创剧集的首播剧集： <em>《Silo</em> 》、 <em>《Ted Lasso》</em> 、 <em>《Severance</em> 》、 <em>《The Morning Show》</em> 、 <em>《Hijack</em> 》（伊德里斯·艾尔巴主演的新惊悚片）——所有这些。这是一个显而易见的策略：即使只看其中一部首播，每月只需花费 7 美元即可观看其余节目。任何流媒体服务的最大障碍就是让人们<em>尝试</em>它。每个拥有 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 的人都已经安装了 Apple 的 TV 应用程序，而且很多人的电视或机顶盒上都已经安装了该应用程序。但苹果并没有从 Twitter 链接到 TV+ 应用程序——他们直接在 Twitter 上分享了整个剧集。不是 YouTube，不是 Facebook。推特。 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/twitter-now-allows-paid-users-to-upload-two-hour-long-videos/">直到上个月，</a>这在技术上还是不可能的。</p><p>但今天要求任何人抛开推特的政治有点像旧的“<em>但除此之外，你觉得这部剧怎么样，林肯夫人？”</em> “ 玩笑。 Twitter 上有一位排名第一的用户，这个用户就是埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk)，随着时间的推移，他的政治和政策的<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4061600-musk-says-cis-cisgender-considered-slurs-on-twitter/">毒性越来越大</a>，而不是越来越小。广告从根本上来说是为了吸引受众而付费，而不是对内容的认可，但在某种程度上它是一种合作伙伴关系。出版商和平台拒绝令人反感的广告，广告商则避开令人反感的平台。 Apple 与 Twitter 的界限在哪里？</p><p>不出所料，马斯克似乎对苹果的<em>Silo</em>促销活动<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1673831774038949888">感到兴奋</a>，其中包括自定义的<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/wwdc-2023-hashflag/">hashflag</a>图标。与 MrBeast 一样有影响力的人吉米·唐纳森 (Jimmy Donaldson)<a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1673850123967770624">回复马斯克</a>：“确实是明智之举，我从来没有听说过这个节目，现在我正在观看第一集并投资，哈哈。”如果你想知道为什么苹果会<em>考虑</em>继续在 Twitter 上做广告，答案是：该平台仍然具有巨大的影响力。</p><p>苹果公司在多种媒体上投入了大量的广告费用。但我唯一看到有人问“苹果为什么<em>在那里</em>做广告？”的地方。是推特。很难不认为，Twitter 失去了优质品牌广告商，并希望快速进军长格式视频内容，从这种<em>筒仓</em>促销中获得的收益比苹果从新发现的观众中获得的收益还要多。重要的不是钱（马斯克有很多钱），而是声望（大多数人认为推特已经破产了）。声望是买不来的，苹果公司选择通过这次促销活动在 Twitter 上给予一些声望。苹果继续在 Twitter 上打广告是否<em>令人愤慨</em>？我拒绝。但他们的选择让人感觉有点奇怪，而且有点好奇。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-28"><p>几周前我开始看<em>Silo</em> ，我非常喜欢它。第一季做得很好，每周都会揭示更多的整体谜团，同时一路上给出一些答案。强大的前提，良好的演员阵容，良好的制作价值。这不是<em>遣散费</em>，但确实很好。 （我对<em>《基金会》</em>也有同样的感觉，但我更喜欢<em>《筒仓》</em> 。）这是一部好剧，我很高兴它<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/silo-renewed-season-2-apple-1235643158/">已经续订了第二季</a>。在某个平行宇宙中， <em>《筒仓》</em>是 Netflix 上的<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80214497">一部剧</a>，本来会有更多人观看，但它<a href="https://www.theonion.com/netflix-condemns-wga-strike-for-putting-future-show-can-1850395744">仍然会被取消</a>。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-06-28"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 在第一季大结局之前，Apple 在 Twitter 上免费提供了《Silo》的整个第一集</title></entry><entry><title>Ron Amadeo 的 Pixel Fold 持续了四天</title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/rip-to-my-pixel-fold-dead-after-four-days/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwa" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/amadeo-pixel-fold" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40042</id><published> 2023-06-27T01:22:48Z</published><updated> 2023-06-27T01:23:09Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

But it fails the sniff test in one regard: I&#39;ve never once heard of anyone complaining that they were tricked into a Prime membership that they didn&#39;t knowingly sign up for. I&#39;ve seen people complaining about how hard it is to cancel all sorts of other subscriptions and memberships. Cable TV providers like Comcast make it really hard to cut the cord. Gyms are notorious for requiring you to cancel a membership in person. And The New York Times only recently began allowing subscribers to cancel over the web, rather than calling and talking to a human whose job it is to <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/new-york-times-writer-unwittingly-calls-out-manipulative-design-at-his-own-paper-99e50c660d59">talk you out of cancelling</a> . Like I mentioned above, The Wall Street Journal <em>still</em> requires this. That should be illegal.</p><p> But Amazon Prime? I&#39;ve never seen anyone complain about this.</p><p> It&#39;s way easier to cancel a Prime membership than most subscriptions. And most of the steps the FTC delineates are reasonable “Are you sure?”防范措施。 It&#39;s like complaining that it takes a few more steps to empty the Trash in MacOS (or Recycle Bin on Windows) than it does to create a new file or folder — destructive actions <em>should</em> take a few extra steps.</p><p> I&#39;d be all in favor of the FTC pursuing and enforcing laws that require <em>all</em> subscription services to have clear, discoverable cancellation options online. In fact, it seems ridiculous that the FTC hasn&#39;t already done this. But singling out Amazon only makes sense insofar as that Lina Khan made a name for herself as a critic of the company.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/amazon-friction-and-the-ftc/">Ben Thompson, today at Stratechery</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This, to my mind, is the chief reason why this complaint rubs me the wrong way: even if there is validity to the FTC&#39;s complaints (more on this in a moment), the overall thrust of the Prime value proposition seems overwhelmingly positive for consumers; surely there are plenty of other products and subscriptions that aren&#39;t just bad for consumers on the edges but also in their overall value proposition and reason for existing.</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ FTC Sues Amazon, Claiming &#39;Deceptive&#39; Prime Sign-Up and Cancellation Process </title></entry><entry><link href="https://axiom.co/?utm_campaign=df1&amp;utm_source=df" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw7" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/06/axiom" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40039</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-06-26T21:55:08Z</published><updated> 2023-06-26T21:55:08Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Allison Johnson, writing for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Google has optimized a bunch of its own apps to work in the Fold&#39;s unfolded tablet mode, and they&#39;re great. Gmail, YouTube, Photos — they all make use of the full screen by putting information in sidebars and vertical columns. Chrome has a desktop-like interface, complete with tabs at the top of the window and the ability to load the full versions of websites. Google Meet readily moved a tiled view of attendees to the top part of the screen when I set the phone up in an L-shape, sliding the controls to the bottom half of the display. I didn&#39;t have to fiddle with anything — it just worked.</p><p> A lot of third-party apps don&#39;t take advantage of the whole inner screen, though, which stinks. Instagram is just a phone-sized app with black bars on either side. Same with Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and even Google-owned Fitbit. You can double-tap the blank space on either side to quickly slide the app to the left, right, or middle, which is nice. TikTok plays its vertical videos in the middle of the screen but at least uses the extra space on either side to move all the text that&#39;s usually right on top of the video out of the way. Even so, it feels like a lot of wasted space when you&#39;re not watching a video or multitasking.</p></blockquote><p> This form factor seems more appealing to me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">than flip phones</a> , but still, I have not an iota of envy from my perch on the iPhone side of the fence. It&#39;s good that Google has tweaked so many of its own Android apps to fully embrace the tablet-sized folded-out screen, but if most of the third-party apps you most use don&#39;t, that seems like the end of the discussion right there.</p><p> It&#39;s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: third-party developers aren&#39;t going to spend time embracing these foldable screens unless there are a lot of phones in use sporting them, but users aren&#39;t likely to buy them until there&#39;s widespread support for them in the apps they use most. If this is a great form factor then Google should stand behind it with a push that declares that foldable screens are the future of Android, or at least the future of Pixel phones. Otherwise it all seems like a waste of time.</p><p> The other problem, I&#39;ll reiterate, is cases. The overwhelming majority of people put their phones in protective cases. The more expensive a phone is, the more likely people will see the need to “protect” it with a case. This phone starts at $1,800 for 256 GB of storage, and costs $1,919 for 512 GB. (The iPhone 14 Pro costs $1,200/$1,400 for the same amounts of storage.) But foldable phones can&#39;t be put in cases. They&#39;re targeting a niche within a niche within a niche — people willing to spend $1,800 on a phone, without using a case, with a foldable display.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out, there <em>are</em> cases for the Pixel Fold: <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_fold_case?hl=en-US">a $60 silicone case from Google itself</a> , and a “coming soon” <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/leather-case-for-pixel-fold">leather one from Bellroy</a> . <strong>Another Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel-fold-case-collection">Some cases from Spigen</a> , starting at $60, and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-google-pixel-fold-cases/">a collection from Android Police of others</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Allison Johnson Reviews the $1,800 Google Pixel Fold’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/pixel-fold-review">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Inside the AI Factory: The Humans That Make Tech Seem Human&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/inside-the-ai-factory" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40037</id><published> 2023-06-26T21:02:52Z</published><updated> 2023-06-26T21:10:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Josh Dzieza, in a splendid investigative report co-published by The Verge <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html">and New York Magazine</a> :</p><blockquote><p> For Joe&#39;s students, it was work stripped of all its normal trappings: a schedule, colleagues, knowledge of what they were working on or whom they were working for. In fact, they rarely called it work at all — just “tasking.” They were taskers.</p><p> The anthropologist David Graeber defines “bullshit jobs” as employment without meaning or purpose, work that should be automated but for reasons of bureaucracy or status or inertia is not. These AI jobs are their bizarro twin: work that people want to automate, and often think is already automated, yet still requires a human stand-in. The jobs have a purpose; it&#39;s just that workers often have no idea what it is. [...]</p><p> This tangled supply chain is deliberately hard to map. According to people in the industry, the companies buying the data demand strict confidentiality. (This is the reason Scale cited to explain why Remotasks has a different name.) Annotation reveals too much about the systems being developed, and the huge number of workers required makes leaks difficult to prevent. Annotators are warned repeatedly not to tell anyone about their jobs, not even their friends and co-workers, but corporate aliases, project code names, and, crucially, the extreme division of labor ensure they don&#39;t have enough information about them to talk even if they wanted to. (Most workers requested pseudonyms for fear of being booted from the platforms.) Consequently, there are no granular estimates of the number of people who work in annotation, but it is a lot, and it is growing. A recent Google Research paper gave an order-of-magnitude figure of “millions” with the potential to become “billions.”</p></blockquote><p> Evocative artwork by Richard Parry accompanying the piece at The Verge, too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Inside the AI Factory: The Humans That Make Tech Seem Human’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/inside-the-ai-factory">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://l.kolide.co/3JWbXEv" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/25/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40036</id><published> 2023-06-25T21:50:09Z</published><updated> 2023-06-25T21:50:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Their premise is simple: if an employee&#39;s device is out of compliance, it can&#39;t access your apps.

<p>Neil Long, writing at Mobilegamer.biz, has an interesting interview with Phillip Shoemaker, who ran App Store review at Apple from 2009 to 2016:</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s app review process remains a huge problem for mobile game-makers as they navigate vague guidelines and inconsistent rulings. So we asked Shoemaker for his thoughts on how Apple can fix it:</p><p> “The way to solve that inconsistency — and I hate to say it — is: let&#39;s take a page from Google,” he told us. “Especially now with the AI tools that are out there. You can do probably 80% of the work the review team does.”</p></blockquote><p> In the era of app stores, it&#39;s seemed pretty clear that Apple&#39;s has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/03/teabot-data-steal-google-play/">fewer problems with malware slipping through</a> than <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-password-stealing-malware-infects-100-000-google-play-users/">Google&#39;s</a> . I&#39;m not aware of a single iOS developer who doesn&#39;t think the App Store, especially review, can and should be improved in numerous ways. But neither “ <em>make it more like the Play Store</em> ” nor “ <em>use AI for review</em> ” sounds right to me.</p><p> Also, App Store review times have decreased from an average of about 5 days to 1 day since Shoemaker left Apple in 2016. (And my understanding is that new automation tools are a big part of that process improvement. Shoemaker&#39;s gripes about App Store review seem stuck in 2016.)</p><blockquote><p> Schiller appears to be the last holdout when it comes to automating app review compared to Apple SVPs Eddy Cue, Greg &#39;Joz&#39; Joswiak and App Store VP Matt Fischer. “I think the way to radically improve the App Store is have Phil be an Apple fellow and get his hands off the App Store,” says Shoemaker. “That&#39;s what they really need to do. Eddy&#39;s more progressive, Joz is more progressive, and we know Matt is as well. Phil just needs to get his meaty paws off the App Store.”</p><p> “If Phil doesn&#39;t step back, it&#39;ll absolutely be the courts making changes,” Shoemaker continues.</p></blockquote><p> If I worked at Apple I&#39;d print up a “Meaty Paws” sign and tape it to Schiller&#39;s door.</p><blockquote><p> “Phil needs to step back, I think that&#39;s the main thing — new blood needs to come in there and make some changes because cutting the price and opening up the guidelines to allow new interesting things is going to be critical.”</p></blockquote><p> Phil Schiller, of course, is the executive <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">who suggested decreasing Apple&#39;s rake in a memo back in 2011</a> .</p><blockquote><p> “It was tough working for Phil…he was one of those guys that would love to throw insults at people, right? I mean he had no boundaries — he&#39;d insult your children and you&#39;re like: &#39;Why am I working at this company again?&#39;”</p><p> Shoemaker would regularly get feedback from his kids on apps and games and use that feedback in the ERB meetings. “Phil would say things like, oh, that&#39;s a stupid thing to say, are your kids that dumb? And you&#39;re like, are you freaking kidding me?”</p></blockquote><p> Seems like the two Phils did not get along. No word from Shoemaker on whether <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/apple-fart-apps/">iWiz is coming back to the App Store</a> , either.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Former App Store Review Lead Phillip Shoemaker Seems to Have an Oddly Personal Grudge Against Phil Schiller’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/shoemaker-schiller">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Why Has Mastodon Adoption Stalled? </title><link href="https://blog.bloonface.com/2023/06/12/why-did-the-twittermigration-fail/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw1" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40033</id><published> 2023-06-23T19:05:11Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T19:05:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Bloonface, in a thoughtful post regarding the stagnation in growth in the Fediverse:</p><blockquote><p> Mastodon is at risk of falling into the trap that a lot of free/open source software does, where the idea of the software being “free as in speech” is expected to outweigh or explain away deficiencies in its usefulness. However, this ignores three salient facts:</p><ul><li><p> Most people don&#39;t give a thruppenny fuck about their freedom to view and edit the source code of the software they use, which they would not know how to do even if they cared;</p></li><li><p> Most people are not ideologically opposed to the notion of proprietary software, and cannot be convinced to be because it is simply not important to them and cannot be explained in terms that are important to them;和</p></li><li><p>When given the choice between a tool which is immediately useful for achieving some sort of goal but conflicts with some kind of ideological standpoint, and a tool which is not as useful but they agree with ideologically, they will probably choose the former.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> After Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter <a href="https://fedidb.org/">there was an initial burst of new users and increased usage</a> on Mastodon (and the rest of the Fediverse, but mostly this is about Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter). And then it flattened, and perhaps has even declined.</p><p> I would like to see Mastodon thrive. But the platform&#39;s ideological zealotry is obviously holding it back and seemingly isn&#39;t going to change. That&#39;s why I&#39;m much more optimistic about Bluesky&#39;s long-term prospects. Six weeks later and I feel stronger than ever about <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314523447694321">this quip I posted in early May</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Bluesky: “If you liked Twitter, you&#39;ll love Bluesky.”</p><p> Mastodon: “If you hated Twitter, you&#39;ll like Mastodon.”</p><p> Hundreds of millions of people liked what Twitter once was, and what it aspired to be. Bluesky might be that.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Why Has Mastodon Adoption Stalled?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WebKit on VisionOS Will Support Open WebXR Content </title><link href="https://www-roadtovr-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-webxr-support-safari-model/amp/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw0" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/webkit-visionos-webxr" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40032</id><published> 2023-06-23T18:38:27Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T21:43:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ben Lang, writing for Road to VR:</p><blockquote><p> In a somewhat surprising move, Apple confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will support WebXR. Prior to the reveal of the headset, it was an open question whether the company would entertain the idea of XR experiences through the browser, and even more so if the company would adopt the relatively new <a href="https://immersiveweb.dev/">WebXR standard</a> . But now Apple has confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will indeed support WebXR.</p><p> The company confirmed as much in its WWDC 2023 developer talk titled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10279/">Meet Safari for Spatial Computing</a> , in which Apple explained the version of Safari running on Vision Pro “truly is Safari with the same WebKit engine underneath, plus some thoughtful additions for [Vision Pro].”</p><p> Thanks to Safari on visionOS being a fully-featured version of the browser, existing websites should work exactly as expected, the company says. But to go beyond flat web pages, Safari on visionOS includes support for WebXR for immersive experiences and the new <code>&lt;model>;</code> tag for 3D models.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find this surprising at all. Apple has always embraced open content and the web, to the extent that it makes sense in the overall platform experience. Web browsing on mobile phones was practically non-existent before the iPhone.

<p>Ian Betteridge:</p><blockquote><p> What defines Mastodon is not the use of a protocol. The protocol is just an enabler. Instead, Mastodon is defined by allowing communities (instances) freedom of association. <em>It is the ability of communities to choose not to federate with anyone else which gives Mastodon its strength.</em></p></blockquote><p> His whole post is thoughtful and considered, and worth your attention. Betteridge largely disagrees with me on this issue, and while he hasn&#39;t changed my mind, I&#39;m happy to direct your attention to his arguments.</p><p> But I do disagree with this:</p><blockquote><p> If you want to understand why some communities are wary of Meta, it&#39;s worth remembering how ActivityPub works. Let&#39;s say I run an instance called EvilMole.social. If I don&#39;t defederate (block) Meta&#39;s server, any user on their server and any user on EvilMole can follow each other. So suppose that @molesworth@evilmole.social follows @billy@meta.social.会发生什么？</p><p> First, every single one of Molesworth&#39;s posts are now available to Meta, including <em>all</em> the replies they make to everyone <em>including people who don&#39;t follow anyone on Meta&#39;s server</em> . In other words, Meta gets access to posts from people who may very well have an issue with that.</p></blockquote><p> If you don&#39;t want Meta (or Google, or whoever) to see your posts, then no matter which instance you&#39;re on, and which other servers your instance chooses to federate with, you need to make your account private. If you&#39;re posting publicly on any Mastodon server, everything you post is visible to the world, including Meta. If your account isn&#39;t private, you&#39;re posting to the open web.

It was carrying a pilot and four passengers, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush. [...]</p><p> “It seems like this submersible has some elements of MacGyvery jerry-rigged-ness. You are putting construction pipes as ballast,” Pogue said to Rush in an interview.</p><p> “I don&#39;t know if I would use that description,” Rush replied. He added that the OceanGate worked with Boeing and Nasa on the pressure vessel. “Everything else can fail. Your thrusters can go, your lights can go, you&#39;re still going to be safe.”</p><p> Pogue said he was nervous before boarding and revealed some of the contents of the waiver form he was required to sign.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced the availability of new software tools and technologies that enable developers to create groundbreaking app experiences for <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> — Apple&#39;s first spatial computer. Featuring visionOS, the world&#39;s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in their physical space using the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — their eyes, hands, and voice. [...] With the visionOS SDK, developers can utilize the powerful and unique capabilities of Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences across a variety of categories including productivity, design, gaming, and more.</p><p> Next month, Apple will open developer labs in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo to provide developers with hands-on experience to test their apps on Apple Vision Pro hardware and get support from Apple engineers. Development teams will also be able to apply for developer kits to help them quickly build, iterate, and test right on Apple Vision Pro.</p></blockquote><p> Three thoughts:</p><ul><li><p> This is the same SDK Apple itself is using to develop VisionOS apps. I mean, sure, Apple has access to private APIs, but that&#39;s true on MacOS and iOS too. But this is not like the original WatchKit in 2015, where third-party developers were stuck with a severely limited SDK that was nothing like the APIs being used by Apple itself for the built-in WatchOS apps. This is real dogfooding, and I bet we see some very strong apps and games for VisionOS on day one.</p></li><li><p> These in-person labs will prove essential for many developers during this prelude period, where developers won&#39;t have access to Vision Pro itself while working on apps.</p></li><li><p> I think Reality Composer Pro could be the sleeper hit of this SDK — a tool not (just) for programmers, but for creative artists. Like what Adobe Illustrator was to graphic design vs. writing Postscript code at the outset of the desktop publishing revolution a generation ago.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘VisionOS SDK Is Now Available’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/visionos-sdk-now-available">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro: I-95 Will Re-Open This Weekend </title><link href="https://twitter.com/governorshapiro/status/1671240085147189249?s=61&amp;t=DcLHtJxGvAJFHF3OQBwFVA" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvr" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/i95-reopening" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40023</id><published> 2023-06-21T21:17:30Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T21:21:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mike Masnick, back in 2019:</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve argued for years that while many people like to say that content moderation is <em>difficult</em> , that&#39;s misleading. Content moderation at scale <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=content+moderation+at+scale">is impossible to do well</a> . Importantly, this is <em>not</em> an argument that we should throw up our hands and do nothing. Nor is it an argument that companies can&#39;t do <em>better jobs</em> within their own content moderation efforts. But I do think there&#39;s a huge problem in that many people — including many politicians and journalists — seem to expect that these companies not only can, but should, strive for a level of content moderation that is simply impossible to reach.</p><p> And thus, throwing humility to the wind, I&#39;d like to propose Masnick&#39;s Impossibility Theorem, as a sort of play on Arrow&#39;s Impossibility Theorem. <em>Content moderation at scale is impossible to do well</em> . More specifically, it will always end up frustrating very large segments of the population and will always fail to accurately represent the “proper” level of moderation of anyone.

<p>My brief “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">Not That Kind of &#39;Open&#39;</a> ” piece yesterday <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230620/p9#a230620p9">struck a chord</a> for some.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@chrismessina/110573508557787120">Chris Messina</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Not federating is certainly a choice admins can make, but it&#39;s unlikely to have an impact considering that Threads is being bootstrapped off the Instagram social graph.</p><p> Would you rather keep the fediverse restricted to its current population of ~8M people or scale it to ~2.35B+?</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t think most Instagram users will even try Threads (or whatever it&#39;s going to be called). But a lot might. And “just sign in using your existing Instagram identity” is a powerful enticement. If you already have an Instagram account, you&#39;ll be able to jump right in. How to get started with Mastodon (or any of the other ActivityPub “Fediverse” platforms) has been an enormous obstacle to adoption. People find it confusing, and people don&#39;t like being confused. “Just use your Instagram identity” is not confusing at all.</p><p> I think there are a lot of long-time Mastodon users who <em>like</em> the fact that it isn&#39;t gaining mainstream traction, and want to keep it that way. But then don&#39;t call it “open”.</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110573756551776352">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s a weird own goal for various Mastodon admins who are running a decentralized social network based on interoperable protocols to pledge that they won&#39;t interoperate with services from existing social networks if built on the same open protocols.</p><p> It&#39;s not even the hypocrisy, it&#39;s just dumb and undermines the entire point of interoperable protocols.</p></blockquote><p> The hypocrisy irks me, but I think he&#39;s right that it&#39;s foolish too. The Mastodon server admins who are preemptively promising to defederate Threads are effectively guaranteeing that users on their instances will be isolated from a potential majority of users on the overall platform.</p><p> <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/19.html">Dave Winer, at Scripting News</a> :</p><blockquote><p> They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is — who&#39;s being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn&#39;t mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn&#39;t one of them. You have to <em>think</em> .</p><p> But here&#39;s some good news. There&#39;s no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it&#39;s probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is “really simple” and the benefit of federation is well known <em>to users</em> . That&#39;s been what&#39;s kept it from being pwned by bigco&#39;s all these years.</p></blockquote><p> I cited email as an example yesterday of big companies running big instances and not extinguishing the openness that made the platform great. Podcasting is maybe an even better example. I don&#39;t take podcasting&#39;s future for granted, but 20 years in, it&#39;s still thriving as an open medium, despite the presence of titanic players like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify. Ultimately the involvement of these big companies has made <em>open</em> podcasting far more popular and enduring than I ever would have imagined 20 years ago, because they brought podcasting to the mass market. And there are some roles that we need big centralized players to play even on an open platform. Apple&#39;s iTunes podcast directory, for example. Facebook&#39;s Threads app could be something akin to Apple Podcasts for Mastodon.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TNLNYC/110576140169004056">Tristan Louis</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The anti-Meta #Fedipact can only achieve one thing: make sure that #ActivityPub loses to the Bluesky protocol. Is that what people here want?</p><p> As an #openweb advocate, I don&#39;t.</p><p> Meta joining the Fediverse is like AOL joining the internet: something that will bring a mass amount of people in, create some friction, but ultimately make the net better as more people federating on #Mastodon, #kbin, #lemmy, #pixelfed and other parts of the Fediverse make open protocols that much stronger.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a> and <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> are to Reddit what Mastodon is to Twitter. Unsurprisingly, they&#39;re <a href="https://kbin.fediverse.observer/stats">both</a> <a href="https://lemmy.fediverse.observer/stats">seeing</a> an infusion of new users this month, but are both still tiny compared to Reddit.</p><p> One controversial aspect to this story is that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384207">Meta apparently invited the admins from several top Mastodon instances to brief them on their plans</a> , under NDA. <a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/110573363201929310">Tim Bray</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My take:</p><ol><li> The Fedi folks shouldn&#39;t have taken the NDA&#39;d meeting. Transparency is essential.</li><li> It is not reasonable to expect ethical behaviour from Meta. It should be assumed that that if they can profit by disemboweling the Fediverse, they will.</li><li> There is an opportunity to attract some of the ordinary decent humans on Meta because they don&#39;t know anything better exists.</li></ol><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t de-federate. But only by about 51/49.</p></blockquote><p> Of course such a meeting would be under NDA, for now. It&#39;s an unreleased and as-yet unannounced product. Meeting with Facebook under NDA isn&#39;t ipso facto wrong — although I do think the fact that they were invited shouldn&#39;t itself be part of the NDA. Transparency is essential, but transparency can come after Threads is actually announced. The idea that NDAs are inherently nefarious is just conspirational tinfoil-hat nonsense. (Tinfoil hat nonsense is, alas, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470">having a moment</a> .)</p><p> On point 2, I&#39;m fine with starting Facebook with two strikes against it. Put them on a short leash. They start fucking around, Mastodon instances should start de-federating from their product. I just don&#39;t see why they should be blocked preemptively. The whole point of an open protocol like ActivityPub is that no one can own it. I&#39;ll close this post with the same question I did <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">yesterday</a> : Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer. Others clearly disagree.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ More on Preemptively Blocking Facebook&#39;s Imminent ActivityPub Entry</title></entry><entry><title> Regulation for Thee, but Not for Me </title><link href="https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvm" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40018</id><published> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Billy Perrigo, reporting for Time:</p><blockquote><p> The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, has spent the last month touring world capitals where, at talks to sold-out crowds and in meetings with heads of governments, he has repeatedly spoken of the need for global AI regulation.</p><p> But behind the scenes, OpenAI has lobbied for significant elements of the most comprehensive AI legislation in the world — the EU&#39;s AI Act — to be watered down in ways that would reduce the regulatory burden on the company, according to documents about OpenAI&#39;s engagement with EU officials obtained by Time from the European Commission via freedom of information requests.</p></blockquote><p> I think concerns about the current state of AI are overwrought, and that regulation is not called for. But what Altman seems to be pushing for isn&#39;t a hands-off approach from regulators — instead he just wants it enshrined in law that OpenAI and only OpenAI is exempt from regulations.</p><p> A very interesting and cogent paper leaked out of Google a few weeks ago, with the title “ <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">We Have No Moat, and Neither Does OpenAI</a> ”. The basic argument in the paper is that open-source AI will outcompete Google and OpenAI&#39;s proprietary approaches. Ever since I read this leaked paper, it&#39;s seemed clear to me that Sam Altman believes this as well, and so he&#39;s been devoted to creating a <em>regulatory</em> moat to protect OpenAI.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Regulation for Thee, but Not for Me’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> On Scanning QR Codes With Your iPhone </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/qr-code-scanning-easier-ios-17/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40017</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:52:13Z</published><updated> 2023-06-27T02:29:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick, on a tweaked feature in iOS 17 beta 1:</p><blockquote><p> Apple in iOS 13 decided to redesign QR code scanning so that the link appeared as a yellow button within the camera viewfinder itself. However, in doing so, it created a new problem: The button would rove around in the viewfinder if the camera lens was also in motion, which made tapping it even more tricky than before.</p><p> Thankfully, in iOS 17, Apple has made another small, and this time welcome, change that improves the situation immeasurably. Now when you scan a QR code, the link button automatically appears at the bottom of the Camera interface. So instead of chasing the dancing link around the viewfinder, you can simply tap its fixed location above the shutter button.</p></blockquote><p> My tip for scanning QR codes is not to use the Camera app at all. Instead, enable iOS&#39;s hidden built-in Code Scanner app in Contol Center. Go to Settings → Control Center, and under More Controls, enable Code Scanner. (This is also a good reminder that you can disable Control Center items you seldom use.) Now when you encounter a QR code, just pull down Control Center and use the Code Scanner app.</p><p> Worth keeping in mind, too, that when you use the regular Camera app to scan a QR code, if you open the link, it opens in Safari. With the Code Scanner app in Control Center, links open in a sandboxed in-app web view, which is more private. The only downside is that if you want to keep the opened page around, you&#39;ll need to open it in Safari from within Code Scanner.</p><p> Code Scanner is a fantastic little “do one thing and do it well” app, but because you can only get to it via Control Center but it&#39;s not shown in Control Center by default, most people don&#39;t even know it exists. It&#39;s truly a hidden gem.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out you can also launch the Code Scanner app <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/code-scanner-via-search.jpeg">by searching for it on the iOS home screen</a> . Also, you can tell Siri “scan a QR code” or “open QR Code Scanner” and it&#39;ll open.好的！</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘On Scanning QR Codes With Your iPhone’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Not That Kind of &#39;Open&#39; </title><link href="https://fedipact.online/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40016</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:27:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-19T23:08:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The Anti-Meta Fedi Pact:</p><blockquote><p> “i am an instance admin/mod on the fediverse. by signing this pact, i hereby agree to block any instances owned by meta should they pop up on the fediverse. project92 is a real and serious threat to the health and longevity of fedi and must be fought back against at every possible opportunity”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jw4o5d45v22a">Yours truly, on Bluesky a month ago</a> (which, ironically, is not yet open itself, so <a href="https://skeeet.xyz/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jw4o5d45v22a">here&#39;s an open preview</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Masto zealots: We&#39;re open, federate with us!</p><p> Instagram: Great, we&#39;re building a new thing to join you.</p><p> Masto zealots: Not that kind of open!</p></blockquote><p> It should go without saying that I&#39;m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/facebook+criminal+enterprise">no fan of Meta/Facebook</a> . But the idea that administrators of Mastodon/Fediverse instances should pledge to preemptively block Facebook&#39;s imminent Twitter-like ActivityPub service ( <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">purportedly named Threads</a> ) strikes me as petty and deliberately insular. I don&#39;t like Facebook, the company, and I&#39;ve never seen the appeal of Facebook, the product (aka “the blue app”). But there are literally <em>billions</em> of good people who use their services. Why cut them off from the open ActivityPub social world? Large swaths of Mastodon seem to relish the fact that it&#39;s confusing how to get started, and that this confusion is keeping Mastodon small.</p><p> The whole point of ActivityPub as an open protocol is to turn Twitter/Instagram-like social networking into something more akin to email: truly open. If Facebook were on the cusp of launching a Gmail-like email service, would you preemptively declare that your email server would block them? To me that&#39;s what this “Anti-Meta Fedi Pact” <a href="https://g33ks.coffee/@tiesselune/110569596742983089">is arguing for</a> .</p><p> Maybe I&#39;m wrong! I certainly don&#39;t think the “ <em>let&#39;s pledge to block Facebook before their Fediverse thing even starts</em> ” people are nuts. But to me this feels like convicting Facebook of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">pre-crime</a> . Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer.

I hadn&#39;t seen any verification emails from Google about it. I told Google Domains to send another verification email. Still didn&#39;t see it.

<p>I got to spend about 30 minutes Monday afternoon using a Vision Pro and VisionOS at Apple Park, in a temporary “field house” building Apple constructed specifically for this experience. This was a one-on-one guided tour with someone from the Vision product marketing team, with the ground rules that I&#39;m allowed to talk about everything I experienced, but photos and videos were not permitted.</p><p> It was a very fast 30 minutes, and the experience was, in a word, immersive. I&#39;d pay good money just to run through the exact same 30 minutes again.</p><p> It was nowhere near enough time, nor was I able to wander far off the rails of the prepared demos. It&#39;s very clear that the OS and apps are far from finished. But even given the brevity of the demo and constraints of the current state of the software, there are a few things I feel confident about describing.</p><p> First: the overall technology is extraordinary, and far better than I expected. And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">like my friend and Dithering co-host Ben Thompson</a> , my expectations were high. Apple exceeded them. Vision Pro and VisionOS feel like they&#39;ve been pulled forward in time from the future. I haven&#39;t had that feeling about a new product since the original iPhone in 2007. There are several aspects of the experience that felt impossible.</p><p> Is it a compelling <em>product</em> , though? It&#39;s a famous Steve Jobs axiom that technology is not enough, that you don&#39;t make compelling products — let alone entire platforms — starting from advanced technology and working backward. You start with a vision for the product and platform experience and then create new technology to make it real. I simply can&#39;t say whether Vision Pro is going to be a compelling product. I spent too little time with it, the software as of today is too far from complete, and, most importantly, the whole experience is too entirely new and mind-bending to render any such conclusion.</p><p> But the potential for Vision Pro to be a compelling product, across several use cases, is obvious. This might be great. And without question it is interesting, and I think the fundamental conceptual bones Apple has designed for VisionOS lay the groundwork for a long future. The first generation Vision Pro may or may not be a successful product — I simply don&#39;t want to speculate on that front yet. But even just a small taste of VisionOS made me feel confident that it is going to be the next major platform for Apple and Apple developers, alongside MacOS and iOS/iPadOS. <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-07">1</a></sup></p><hr /><p> A few years ago I stopped wearing contact lenses and have since worn corrective eyeglasses full-time. Before my demo, a rep from Apple took my glasses and used a device to measure my lenses to provide corrective lens inserts for my demo unit. It only took about 3 or 4 minutes. When Vision Pro goes on sale next year, buying corrective lens inserts will probably work like buying eyeglasses online from a retailer like Warby Parker — you&#39;ll provide a copy of your prescription from your eye doctor. It&#39;ll be a slight hassle for us glasses wearers, but not much, and it&#39;s unavoidable. (I see pretty well close up without glasses, so I&#39;m curious how well I might see using Vision Pro without corrective lenses.) After the lens measurement I used an iPhone to do a brief facial scan akin to registering for Face ID (look at the phone, turn your head in a circle), and an ear scan. This test was for identifying a light seal that would best block light, and calibrating the speakers.</p><p> My demo was conducted in a relatively spacious living room. I sat on a couch. My tour guide, as it were, from product marketing sat on an arm chair next to the couch. We took a few minutes to go through the strap adjustments to make it comfortable on my face. My light seal was good, but not perfect. The single biggest downside from my demo experience is that Vision Pro feels heavier on your face than I had hoped it would. It&#39;s not uncomfortable — at least not for 30 minutes — but I never forgot it was there, and it just makes your head feel a bit front-heavy.</p><p> The first run experience wearing Vision Pro requires a few minutes of very simple eye-tracking calibration exercises. You hold your head still, and VisionOS shows a series of dots in front of you, on a pure black background. Moving only your eyes, not your head, you simply look at each dot in front of you as they appear. After a minute or two of that, boom, you&#39;re in.</p><p> What you see at first is just ... your world. You just see the room you&#39;re in. There&#39;s no status information, no metadata, no indicators. Just input from the cameras on the front of the headset, presented on the displays in front of your eyes. It does not magically look indistinguishable from real life, but it does not feel like looking at a screen <em>at all</em> . I perceived absolutely no latency. I definitely could not see pixels — the experience is “retina” quality. Apple is not yet stating what frame rate Vision Pro runs at, but I&#39;m guessing it runs at 90 frames per second, if not higher.</p><p> Again, it doesn&#39;t look at all like looking at screens inside a headset. It looks like reality, albeit through something like a pair of safety glasses or a large face-covering clear shield. There is no border in the field of vision — your field of view through Vision Pro exactly matches what you see through your eyes without it. Most impressively, and uncannily, the field of view seemingly <em>exactly</em> matches what you see naturally. It&#39;s not even slightly wider angle, or even slightly more telephoto. There is no fisheye effect and no aberrations or distortion in your peripheral vision. What you see in front of your face exactly matches what your own eyes see when you lift the Vision Pro up over your eyes. Imagine a set of safety glasses that used a glass treatment that gives the world a slight bit of a “film look”. A slight tint (that tint might get dialed in closer to reality by next year — to me it felt ever so slightly warm, color-wise), and a slight bit of visually flattering smoothness to everything.</p><p> To do anything in VisionOS, you start by single-pressing the digital crown button above your right eye. (The other top button, on the left, will be used to capture spatial photos and videos, but that button was disabled on our demo units yesterday). Press the digital crown button and boom, your home screen of app icons appears in a plane in front of you. Long-press the digital crown button and it re-centers your virtual world in front of whatever you&#39;re now looking at.</p><p> The navigation model of VisionOS is a breakthrough of conceptual simplicity. You simply look at something and tap your index finger and thumb, on either of your hands. I&#39;ll call this “tapping” for lack of a better verb. When you look at any tappable UI element in VisionOS, it is visually highlighted. This highlighting is extremely similar to the hover effect in iPadOS when using a trackpad or mouse. In iPadOS, if you move the mouse pointer circle to a button or icon, that button/icon pops a bit, visually. If you look at a button or icon in VisionOS, that button/icon pops a bit. Some apps have toolbars with a dark background and gray button icons. Look at a button and that button will turn white. Tap your finger and thumb while looking at it and it activates.就是这样。 Incredibly simple, surprisingly effective.</p><p> At first I found myself reaching out to pinch the icons and buttons I saw in front of me. Like if I wanted to activate Safari I&#39;d reach my hand toward the Safari icon and pinch it. That works fine. But it&#39;s completely unnecessary. You really can just leave your hands on your lap. It works when you try to pinch the actual virtual icon in your field of vision because you are looking at the icon, and your finger and thumb do tap, but your hands can be anywhere. All that matters is what you&#39;re looking at. It started feeling natural within just a minute or two, and I could feel myself navigating the interface faster as the demo went on.</p><p> The next most striking aspect of the experience is that everything in VisionOS is completely stable in space. Let&#39;s say you open a Safari window, then open a Messages window next to it. (You can move windows around the room by pinching and dragging on a “Window Bar” that hovers underneath every window. You can move windows left/right, up/down, <em>and</em> closer/further away from you.) Then you turn your head 90 degrees to your side, then turn your head to the other side, and then return your gaze to the center. Those windows for Safari and Messages do not move at all, relative to the real world. Not even a little. You know how when you use AR on an iPhone or iPad — the built-in Measure app is a perfect example — and virtual UI elements or items move around a little bit relative to reality as you pan and rotate the iPhone or iPad? There&#39;s nothing like that in VisionOS. Virtual elements are utterly stable. Obviously that&#39;s what you <em>want</em> in an XR experience, but to my knowledge no other headset can achieve this stability. My understanding is that this profound stability — this palpable <em>realness</em> of virtual elements — is thanks to the extraordinary precise eye-tracking that Vision Pro achieves. <em>Uncanny</em> is often a pejorative — eg with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> — but in this case I use it as strong praise. It is simply uncanny how Vision Pro makes virtual elements as spatially stable as the walls and furniture and people in the room around you.</p><p> There&#39;s also a top-level “Environments” tab on the left side of the home screen. Everything I&#39;ve described thus far took place in the de facto default “environment” which is your actual surroundings. But the Environments tab allows you to switch from pass-through camera reality to a virtual reality. One of the locations I experienced was Mount Hood. Choose it and it&#39;s like you&#39;re there. These environments are incredibly immersive, 360 degrees. And so instead of catching up on Mail and Messages in floating windows in your living room, you can do it while it appears like you&#39;re atop a mountain, or on a beach, or, well, anywhere. It&#39;s beautiful, and every bit as stable spatially as pass-through reality. When you&#39;re in an immersive environment, you can turn the digital crown to adjust how far it wraps around your field of vision. Fully immersive means you don&#39;t see anything from your actual physical environment; partial immersion dials it back from your periphery to the center, with blurred dream-like edges.</p><p> Lastly, “breakthrough” is Apple&#39;s term for a feature that identifies real human beings who approach you while immersed. They sort of fade in, as transparent ghosts. But not spooky ghosts. It&#39;s a seamless feature, and given my experience with other VR headsets, a necessary one to avoid being isolated from the people around you once you&#39;re immersed. You see someone fade into view, and you can turn the digital crown to dial back the degree of immersion and truly look at them.</p><hr /><p> Apple is <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1665806600261763072">promoting</a> the Vision Pro announcement as the launch of “the era of spatial computing”. That term feels perfect. It&#39;s not AR, VR, or XR. It&#39;s spatial computing, and some <em>aspects</em> of spatial computing are AR or VR.</p><p> To me the Macintosh has always felt more like a <em>place</em> than a <em>thing</em> . Not a place I go physically, but a place my mind goes intellectually. When I&#39;m working or playing and in the flow, it has always felt like MacOS is where I <em>am</em> . I&#39;m in the Mac. Interruptions — say, the doorbell or my phone ringing — are momentarily disorienting when I&#39;m in the flow on the Mac, because I&#39;m pulled out of that world and into the physical one. There&#39;s a similar effect with iOS too, but I&#39;ve always found it less profound. Partly that&#39;s the nature of iOS, which doesn&#39;t speak to me, idiomatically, like MacOS does. I think in many ways that explains why I never feel <em>in the flow</em> on an iPad like I can on a Mac, even with the same size display. But with the iPhone in particular screen size is an important factor. I don&#39;t think <em>any</em> hypothetical phone OS could be as immersive as I find MacOS, simply because even the largest phone display is so small. Watching a movie on a phone is a lesser experience than watching on a big TV set, and watching a movie on even a huge TV is a lesser experience than watching a movie in a nice theater. We humans are visual creatures and our field of view affects our sense of importance. Size matters.</p><p> The <em>worlds</em> , as it were, of MacOS and iOS (or Windows, or Android, or whatever) are defined and limited by the displays on which they run. If MacOS is a place I go mentally when working, that place is manifested physically by the Mac&#39;s display. It&#39;s like the playing field, or the court, in sports — it has very clear, hard and fast, rectangular bounds. It is of fixed size and shape, and everything I do in that world takes place in the confines of those display boundaries.</p><p> VisionOS is very much going to be a conceptual place like that for work. But there is no display. There are no boundaries. The intellectual “place” where the apps of VisionOS are presented is the real-world place in which you use the device, or the expansive virtual environment you choose. The room in which you&#39;re sitting is the canvas. The whole room. The display on a Mac or iOS device is to me like a portal, a rectangular window into a well-defined virtual world. With VisionOS the virtual world is the actual world around you.</p><p> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. Using a Mac, you are in a physical place, there is a display in front of you in that place, and on that display are application windows. Using VisionOS, there are just application windows in the physical place in which you are. On Monday I had Safari and Messages and Photos open, side by side, each in a window that seemed the size of a movie poster — that is to say, each app in a window that appeared larger than any actual computer display I&#39;ve ever used. All side by side. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Some of the videos in Apple&#39;s Newsroom post</a> introducing Vision Pro illustrate this. But seeing a picture of an actor in this environment doesn&#39;t do justice to experiencing it firsthand, because a photo showing this environment itself has defined rectangular borders.</p><p> This is not confusing or complex, but it feels profound. Last night I chatted with a friend who, I found out only then, has been using Vision Pro for months inside Apple. While talking about this “your real world room is your canvas for arranging your application windows” aspect of the experience, he said that he spent weeks feeling a bit constrained, keeping his open VisionOS windows all in front of him as though on a virtual display, before a colleague opened his mind to <em>spreading out</em> and making applications windows much larger and arranging them in a wider carousel not merely in front of him but <em>around</em> him. The constraints of even the largest physical display simply do not exist with VisionOS.</p><hr /><p> I&#39;d group everything I experienced Monday into three loose categories.</p><p> The first, for lack of a better term, is simply “computing”. Work, as it were. Reading web pages, talking via FaceTime, reading email or messages. Using <em>apps</em> . You start with an iOS-like grid of app icons, tap on apps to open them in windows, and arrange and resize those windows however you want. Text is very readable in windows. My brief 30 minute demo covered a lot, so I have zero perspective on how pleasant or tolerable it is to read for long stretches of time, but my impression is that it&#39;s more than fine. Windows look solid, text looks crisp, and you can make windows really big in virtual space. If anything is going to seem weird or wrong about long-form reading in VisionOS, it&#39;s not the visual fidelity, but rather the fact that I&#39;ve never once in my life read an article or email message in a window that appeared 4 or 5 feet tall.</p><p> The second type of experience is the consumption of 2D content, like photos and videos. Watching a regular movie on a virtual huge screen is incredible. It&#39;s way more like watching a movie in a real cinema than like watching on a TV. One of the movies Apple had us watch was James Cameron&#39;s <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> , both in a window floating in front of us, and then in “theater mode”, which immersively removes your actual physical surroundings. Cameron shot <em>Avatar 2</em> with state-of-the-art 3D cameras, and the 3D effect was, as promised, better than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in a theater or theme park. I don&#39;t generally like 3D feature-length movies at all — I find myself not remembering them afterwards — but I might watch movies like <em>Avatar</em> this way with Vision Pro. But even though <em>Avatar</em> is 3D, it&#39;s still a rectangular movie. It&#39;s just presented as a very large rectangle with very compelling 3D depth inside that rectangle.</p><p> The third type of experience is fully immersive. Content Apple commissioned and created that is inherently only consumable in three dimensions. Full immersion, like transporting you to a cliff&#39;s edge atop a mountain, or lakeside on a beautiful spring day. Some of these immersive environments surround you completely — you can turn around 360 degrees, and look up at the sky or down at the ground (or, dizzyingly, down over the cliff&#39;s edge). Another custom experience involved a portal opening on the wall across the room, out of which first flew a small butterfly that landed on my extended finger. This is so compelling that some of the media people who experienced it had their minds tricked into <em>feeling</em> the butterfly land. I did not, but I can see why they did. Then, a dinosaur — a velociraptor-looking thing, seemingly about 9 or 10 feet tall — approached the “portal” in the wall and came halfway through into the room. I was invited to stand up from the couch and approach it. There was a coffee table in front of the couch, a possible shin-banging accident waiting to happen, but the pass-through video experience is so seamless, so natural, so much like just looking through glasses, not looking at a screen inside a headset, that it took no concentration or carefulness at all on my part to stand up and walk around the coffee table and approach the dinosaur. The dinosaur was not pre-recorded. It reacted, live, to me, keeping eye contact with me at all times. It was spooky, and a significant part of my own lizard brain was instinctively <em>very</em> alarmed. I got extremely close to the dinosaur&#39;s head, and the illusion that it was real never broke down. Even up close, there was no sign that it was composed of polygons stitched together or something. It looked like a 10-foot tall dinosaur that could kill me with a snap of its jaws, right there in the room with me, as close to my face as the MacBook Pro display on which I&#39;m writing these words is right now.</p><p> Spatial photos and videos — photos and videos shot with the Vision Pro itself — are viewed as a sort of hybrid between 2D content and fully immersive 3D content. They don&#39;t appear in a crisply defined rectangle. Rather, they appear with a hazy dream-like border around them. Like some sort of teleportation magic spell in a Harry Potter movie or something. The effect reminded me very much of Steven Spielberg&#39;s <em>Minority Report</em> , in the way that Tom Cruise&#39;s character <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">could obsessively watch “memories” of his son</a> , and the way the psychic “precogs” perceive their visions of murders about to occur. It&#39;s like watching a dream, but through a portal opened into another world.</p><p> Lastly, we saw two sports demos: an at-bat from a baseball game at Fenway Park (Phil Schiller&#39;s hands are all over that one), and a scoring play from a Nuggets-Suns NBA basketball game. For the baseball game, the perspective wasn&#39;t even from the stands, but rather from the home team&#39;s dugout, ground level, right behind first base. It&#39;s not quite <em>just</em> like being there, but it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like being there. It&#39;s more realistic than seems possible. You choose where to direct your gaze: at the batter at home plate, at the pitcher, or out in the outfield. Or above the outfielders, at the scoreboard. For the NBA game, the perspective was courtside, right behind the basket. But better than the actual courtside perspective, because the perspective was slightly elevated above seating level. Fully immersive, fully three-dimensional, and seemingly perfectly to scale. Kevin Durant looked about 6&#39;10&quot;, right in front of me. Getting the scale just right is obviously the correct way to present this, but it seems devilishly tricky to actually pull off. Apple has pulled it off. These baseball and basketball scenes were shot by Apple using entirely custom camera rigs, and stored in altogether new file formats. This is nothing at all like 2D footage extrapolated into 3D, or just painted on a virtual circular wall around you. It looks real. It seems as profoundly different from watching regular TV telecasts of sports as TV telecasts are from audio-only radio broadcasts. <sup id="fnr2-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn2-2023-06-07">2</a></sup> It was incredible. I would genuinely consider buying a Vision Pro if the one and only thing it did was show entire sporting events like this.</p><p> The first two types of experiences — doing computer “work”, and watching 2D and 2D-ish 3D content, have analogs to existing experiences. Using Safari in VisionOS is like using Safari on a Mac or iPad, but with a different presentation. Watching a movie in VisionOS is just watching a movie, albeit with the completely convincing illusion that you&#39;re looking at an enormous room-filling cinema screen. But the third, these original immersive experiences, have no analogs except to the real world. It&#39;s extraordinary, and only possible because Apple has gotten so many little things so exactly right.</p><p> I walked away from my demo more than a bit discombobulated. Not because it was disorienting or even the least bit nauseating, but because it was so unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. It strikes me that in some ways Bob Iger&#39;s cameo during the keynote had the relationship between Apple and Disney backwards. Iger spent his keynote cameo talking about Disney creating original new content for VisionOS&#39;s new medium. But after experiencing it, it felt more like what Disney should want is Apple providing this technology for Disney to use in their theme parks. The sports and dinosaur demos I experienced using Vision Pro were in many ways more immersive and thrilling than tentpole major attractions I&#39;ve experienced at Disney World.</p><p> Are you going to want to buy a Vision Pro for $3,500? That price is high enough that the answer is probably not, for most of you, no matter how compelling it is. But are you going to want to try one out for an hour or two, and find yourself craving another hour or two?我保证。你需要看到它。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn3-2023-06-07">3</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-07"><p> I mean no disrespect to WatchOS or even tvOS by leaving them off that list.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/1659593595643662336-vhv6gL8w">Ben Bajarin on Twitter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If Apple is releasing a VR/AR headset this year, it makes more sense for a dedicated event or bundle it with a Mac event in the fall.</p><p> There is too much ground to cover at WWDC, and 30 min is not enough to tell the full product story.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been thinking about this too. The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple&#39;s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we&#39;re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it&#39;s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that&#39;s an easy announcement: it&#39;s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it&#39;s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850">Last year&#39;s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos">here&#39;s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p><p> But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There&#39;s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn&#39;t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn&#39;t. They might have ideally wanted to announce it <em>before</em> this year&#39;s WWDC at a special event, but if they want developers to start creating software for the platform, this is the time. (And why wouldn&#39;t they want developers to start working on ideas?)</p><p> Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p><p> Here&#39;s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren&#39;t just pre-recorded, they&#39;re very tightly edited. I suspect we&#39;ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It&#39;ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem with the new “keynote movie” format. <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-19">1</a></sup> We won&#39;t come out of the keynote thinking it was too long; we&#39;ll come out of it with our heads spinning because it&#39;s going to cover so much, so fast.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-19"><p> And if I&#39;m right, I bet this is one of those years where after the keynote is over, and people start poring over everything Apple puts on the web, we discover a surprising number of very cool iOS and MacOS features that didn&#39;t make it into the keynote. Anything and everything from the OSes might get cut to make time for the headset, xrOS, and Mac hardware announcements. There&#39;s a whole second State of the Union technical keynote in the afternoon where features cut from the main morning keynote can go. <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ On Apple Fitting a Headset Announcement Into the Always-Packed WWDC Keynote</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
