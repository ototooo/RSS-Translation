<p>韦恩·马（Wayne MA）的大片报告（付费沃尔（Paywall）和昂贵，a）：</p><blockquote><p>但是，同样重要的因素是苹果内部的人格冲突，据AI和软件工程小组工作的多个人说。由Giannandrea领导的AI和机器学习小组工作的六个以上的前苹果员工（简称AI/ML）告诉信息，该信息应归咎于其处决问题应归咎于领导层。他们挑出了沃克，因为缺乏野心和对设计语音助手的未来版本冒险的兴趣。</p><p>在Apple内部的工程师中，AI集团的轻松文化以及与执行的斗争甚至赢得了一个不可清的昵称，这是其首字母缩写：毫无目的。</p></blockquote><p>哎哟。 ma名称，报告到处都是勺子：</p><blockquote><p>沃克（Walker）是一位经常受到同事批评的西里领导人，他于2013年加入苹果，并在2022年底对其日常运营负责。在他的批评家看来，沃克（Walker）不愿意对Siri承担巨大的风险，并专注于衡量指标，这些指标并没有使针头的表现如此之多，而不是对高见远见进行大声远见。</p><p>前苹果工程师说，例如，他经常庆祝小胜利，例如将某人问Siri一个问题与回答时的延误降低百分比。他们说，另一个宠物沃克项目是从“ Hey Siri”语音命令中删除了助手的“ Hey”，该助手花了两年多的时间才能完成。</p></blockquote><p>马描述的是沃克（Walker）错过了整个森林吮吸且专注于一两棵好树时没有起作用的事实。毫无疑问，更快的响应时间是一个巨大的胜利，但是错误或无用的答案并不是一场胜利。 （我几乎不确定要取消使用口头“嘿”前缀的要求是一个胜利。这纯粹是轶事和个人的，但是我现在比“嘿，嘿”是必需的及时的召唤更加不必要的调用。</p><p>最后一个掘金：</p><blockquote><p>其他怨恨也建立了。软件工程组中的一些人因其在AI组中的同事所接受的高薪和更快的促销而感到恼火。他们感到很痛苦的是，AI集团中的一些工程师似乎能够在周五早些时候休假，而他们面临着更加惩罚的工作时间表。</p><p>两组之间的不信任变得如此糟糕，以至于今年早些时候，吉安南德里亚（Giannandrea）的一位代表要求工程师广泛记录联合项目的发展，以便如果失败了，费德里吉（Federighi）的小组将无法替代AI团队。</p><p>当费德里吉（Federighi）开始积累自己的数百名机器学习工程师团队时，这并没有帮助小组之间的关系，这些工程师以智能系统的名称为名称，并由Federighi的顶级代表之一Sebastien Marineau-Mes经营。</p></blockquote><p>苹果AI/ML部门以外的数百名机器学习团队的工程师听起来像功能障碍的定义。我真的怀疑费德里吉还在约翰·斯鲁吉（Johny Srouji）的部门外组装了一支硅工程师团队，因为Srouji的团队不仅是功能性的，而且正确地认为是世界上任何领域中最高功能的工程部门之一。</p><p>我希望我可以分享与MA报告的礼物链接，但是信息的礼物链接仅适用于最多三个人。我能做的最好的事情就是<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/">指向哈特利·查尔顿（Hartley Charlton）的宏观摘要</a>。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“韦恩·马（Wayne MA）的信息：‘苹果如何摸索Siri的AI改头换面”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/10/wayne-ma-the-information-apple-siri-fumble">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “美国破坏” </title><link href="https://stratechery.com/2025/american-disruption/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w96" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/american-disruption" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41802</id><published> 2025-04-10T01：42：42Z</published><updated> 2025-04-10T01：42：42Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Chance Miller，在9to5mac写作：</p><blockquote><p>在此之前，白宫新闻秘书卡罗琳·莱维特（Karoline Leavitt）<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pWppUGRRHl4">今天说</a>，特朗普坚信苹果可以将iPhone制造转移到美国。为了回应《纽约时报》的玛姬·哈伯曼（Maggie Haberman）关于特朗普希望通过这些关税创造的工作类型的问题，利维特说：</p><blockquote><p> “总统希望在美利坚合众国增加制造业工作，但他也在研究高级技术。他还在研究AI和新兴领域，这些领域正在全球发展，这些领域也需要美国也需要成为一系列多样化的工作。还有一系列多样化的工作。更传统的制造业工作，以及高级技术的工作。</p></blockquote><p>哈伯曼（Haberman）提出了有关iPhone制造业的问题，询问特朗普是否认为这是可以迁移到美国的“这种技术”。利维特回答：</p><blockquote><p> “ [特朗普]认为我们有劳动，我们有劳动力，我们有资源可以做到这一点。正如您所知，苹果在美国已经投资了5000亿美元。因此，如果苹果不认为美国能做到这一点，那么他们可能就不会付出很大的变化。”</p></blockquote><p>利维特（Leavitt）从2月开始就提到苹果的<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/24/apple-us-investment-trump-tariffs/">宣布</a>，当时它将“在未来四年内在美国花费超过5000亿美元”。然而，苹果的承诺使美国的iPhone组装零零。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/">新闻稿的</a>重点是美国的研发，亚利桑那州的CHIP生产，休斯敦的AI服务器制造，Apple TV+ Production以及密歇根州的一所学院。</p><p>今天还值得一读的是<a href="https://www.404media.co/a-us-made-iphone-is-pure-fantasy/">404媒体的这个故事</a>，这概述了为什么在美国制造的iPhone是“纯粹的幻想”的原因。</p></blockquote><p>考虑到这一点的另一种方法是，<em>除了</em>中国以外，iPhone（我们知道的iPhone）实际上是在其他任何地方都无法制作的。苹果没有公开陈述制造多少iPhone的国家，在哪种国家（他们对此都有秘密的震惊），但<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-notched-its-biggest-gain-in-27-years-is-the-optimism-justified-e3e62c34">估计PEG</a>年产量在中国为85-90％，印度10％，其余在巴西和越南。工资甚至没有接近最大的原因。最终，中国供应链的最大独特因素是规模。富士康在中国的iPhone工厂不仅仅是建筑物，甚至不是真正的校园 - 它们更像是<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract">整个城市</a>。</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inlDT62oGy8">我们可以开玩笑说我们制造的iPhone耗资9,000美元，</a>但笑话错过了这一点。如果世界上所有出售给美国人的iPhone都是在美国制造的，那么iPhone所有权都不是司空见惯的情况。让我们<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/how_many_iphones_can_fit_on_a_freight_plane">估计</a>，苹果在美国每年售出5000万台iPhone。苹果在美国<em>每年</em>无法制造5000万台iPhone。这个问题没有任何资金可以扔给这个问题，并在不久的将来是在美国制造的5000万个新iPhone。苹果可以在这里制作<em>一些</em>iPhone，但不多。无论如何，无论如何都必须进口的组件（显示器，芯片）构建许多。</p><p>即使苹果公司要大幅提高iPhone的价格，即使以某种方式对iPhone的需求并没有下降，但面对较高的价格，苹果在美国这里根本无法制造数千万iPhone。但是，面对更高的价格，当然需求<em>会</em>急剧下降。灰色市场将立即上升。因为即使苹果神奇地能够在美国建造数千万iphone，他们仍将在中国建造<em>数亿美元</em>的iPhone，而这些中国组装的iPhone的成本也较低。我想象的是整个盗版者的整个盗版工业，从加拿大进入美国，跑步中国制造的iPhone，而不是从苹果商店购买iPhone，而是会从U-Haul卡车的背上购买它们。 （对于各种产品，灰色市场的盗版是<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-tariffs-smugglers/682303/">不可避免的</a>。如果加拿大比美国更便宜的东西，那么有人会在边境上走私它。）</p><p>根本没有场景，每年有5000万美国人以他们愿意支付的价格购买iPhone，而没有大多数人是由苹果公司建造的中国供应链制造的。</p><div> <a  title="与“据说特朗普”的永久链接认为，美国拥有制造iPhone所需的“资源”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/trump-think-us-has-resources-to-make-iphones">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/webkit_textwrap_pretty" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w94" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：//1.41800</id><published> 2025-04-09T23：11：05Z</published><updated> 2025-04-10T19：18：08Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我认为这是一个不错的开端，我对Webkit团队甚至根本无法解决这个问题感到高​​兴。正如Simmons指出的那样，到目前为止，Web浏览器中的线条包裹布局已经非常粗糙 - 并且网络已经很长时间了。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>詹·西蒙斯（Jen Simmons）在Webkit博客上写道：“<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/16547/better-typography-with-text-wrap-pretty/">更好的版式和文本包装漂亮</a>”：</p><blockquote><p> 30多年来，网络只有一种技术来确定在哪里包装文本。</p><p>浏览器从文本的第一行开始，然后将每个单词或音节置于一个接一个的单词或音节，直到它耗尽房间为止。一旦它没有更多的空间来适合另一个单词/音节，它就会包裹到下一行（如果允许<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap-mode">包装</a>）。然后它从下一行开始，拟合所有可以的内容……然后，当它耗尽房间时，它包裹着……并开始在下一行上工作。</p><p>它总是一次只考虑一行。它随时需要包装，在适合上一行的最大内容之后。如果连字符打开，它将连字符在生产线上持久的任何单词，无论如何在上一行上留下的单词尽可能多。什么都没有考虑 - 这就是为什么网络上的文字具有毫无意义的抹布，河流，河流，短路和连字符的原因。</p><p>这是由计算机布置的事实并不需要。几十年来，Adobe Indesign和Latex等软件一次评估了多行文本，因为它们决定在哪里结束一行并开始下一条线。只是网络没有使用多行算法。到目前为止。</p><p>在Safari Technology Preview 216中，我们很高兴能将这种功能首次登上网络。</p></blockquote><p>至少是作为一个实验，我已经在Daring Fireball上打开了此操作。 （看着我，快速采用新颖的CSS功能。）我对结果有不同的感觉。这里保存了PDF，显示了我的“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/how_many_iphones_can_fit_on_a_freight_plane">几个新iPhone可以适合货运飞机？</a> ”的渲染，该文章今天早些时候：<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-iphones-on-plane-textwrap-auto.pdf">首先是传统的<code>text-wrap: auto</code></a>线条包装，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-iphones-on-plane-textwrap-pretty.pdf">其次是Webkit的新<code>text-wrap: pretty</code></a> in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/">STP</a> 216。我看到的问题是从一个段落到另一个段落。在段落中，Webkit的新<code>pretty</code>包装肯定会使线条变得更加均匀。但是在某些情况下，它缩小了整个段落，以至于从一个段落到下一个刺耳的段落。线到线新算法看起来更好，但是段落到段落我认为看起来更糟。</p><p>来自<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">我最近最长的文章的</a>一个具体例子。首先，带有旧的<code>text-wrap: auto</code> ：</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/04/df-something-rotten-textwrap-auto.png" class="noborder"><img

They&#39;re Microsoft — the entire point of the company (and thus the core point of the 50th anniversary celebration) is that their software is ubiquitous.

If Microsoft employees really want to make the case that the company should sever all ties to Israel, go ahead, but performance stunts at public celebrations are not the way. Why do they even work for Microsoft if they&#39;re not happy to celebrate the company&#39;s own 50th anniversary? Why did Microsoft hire people who seemingly despise the very company they work for?</p><p> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard but there&#39;s a lot of horrible shit going on around the world right now. Should Microsoft sever all ties to Republican-led states that have made women&#39;s reproductive healthcare illegal? ( <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-arrest-miscarriage-fetal-personhood-rcna199400">A woman in Georgia was just arrested after suffering a miscarriage</a> .)

<p>Susan Glasser, writing for The New Yorker, “Donald Trump&#39;s Ego Melts the Global Economy”:</p><blockquote><p> In this new political moment of the unthinkable made manifest, the sheer power rush for Trump should also not be underestimated. Imagine his joy as he sat down to sign an executive order decreeing the new tariffs on the basis of sweeping powers he may or may not legally possess to declare a “national economic emergency” — here was Trump transforming the world with a single flourish of his Sharpie pen. “It&#39;s such an honor to be finally able to do this,” he said. At what other moment in modern times has a single man wielded so much unaccountable power over such a large swath of the world economy? There are whole businesses devoted to risk analysis for corporations; this is a situation in which Trump himself is the risk and the crisis being analyzed is one that he created. Talk about an ego trip.</p></blockquote><p> Glasser links to <a href="https://x.com/Kasparov63/status/1907798003236188169">Garry Kasparov, on X</a> , responding to Wall Street&#39;s collective surprise that Trump did what he&#39;s been saying he would do re: tariff policy:</p><blockquote><p> As I&#39;ve said for years about Putin, and which applies to other autocratic personalities like Trump: “Dictators always lie about what they&#39;ve done, but are often quite plain about what they want to do.” “Trump would never...” is the new “Putin would never...”</p><p> Such people do and take whatever they can, unless they are stopped. That they don&#39;t always succeed does not mean they were not sincere in their ambitions and won&#39;t keep trying to fulfill them. Trump has only been emboldened by the sycophantic GOP this time around.</p></blockquote><p> Even more apt, “Deep Throat” explaining the central truth of the Watergate scandal to Bob Woodward in the Alan-Pakula-directed / William-Goldman-written film adaptation of <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/891-all-the-president-s-men?language=en-US">All the President&#39;s Men</a></em> :</p><blockquote><p> “Forget the myths the media has created about the White House.

<p>CNBC:</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump on Friday extended a deadline requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the US operations of TikTok or face an effective ban in the country, marking the second time he has taken such action.</p></blockquote><p> Trump, on Truth Social, which is by far the most popular social network in the world:</p><blockquote><p>我的政府一直在努力挽救Tiktok的协议，我们取得了巨大的进步。该交易需要更多的工作来确保签署所有必要的批准，这就是为什么我要签署执行命令，以使Tiktok启动并额外运行75天。我们希望继续与中国真诚地合作，我了解我们对我们的互惠关税不太满意（对于中国和美国之间的公平和平衡的贸易所必需的！）。这证明关税是最强大的经济工具，对我们的国家安全非常重要！我们不希望Tiktok“变黑”。我们期待与Tiktok和中国合作完成这笔交易。感谢您对此事的关注！</p></blockquote><p> Those are the remarks of the most powerful man in the world.</p><p> Keep in mind, too, that there is no mechanism in the law for the president to issue any such extension.

<p>Akash Sriram, reporting for Reuters under the headline “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/will-trump-tariffs-make-apple-iphones-more-expensive-2025-04-03/">A $2,300 Apple iPhone? Trump Tariffs Could Make That Happen.</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.</p><p> Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.</p></blockquote><p> Apple shares dropped <em>another</em> 7.3% percent today. Apple alone has lost 16.6% of its value in the last 48 hours; the S&amp;P 500 dropped 10%.</p><blockquote><p> The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the US with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% — if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers. A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s under-remarked upon, but Apple, to a point of almost obstinance, considers pricing part of the brand for its products. They tend not to raise or lower prices with the ebbs and flows of the world economy or even the obvious constraints of simple supply and demand. Throughout the entire COVID crisis, I don&#39;t recall them changing their prices for anything.</p><p> As an extreme example, consider the trashcan Mac Pro. It was introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/06/10Apple-Gives-Sneak-Peek-Into-the-Future-of-the-Pro-Desktop/">at WWDC 2013</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/10/23Introducing-the-All-New-Mac-Pro-The-Most-Radical-Mac-Ever/">shipped in December that year</a> with a starting price of $2,999. It then went <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/833730471804731392">over three years without an update</a> — and still cost $2,999. Then in April 2017 Apple held <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">that highly unusual small roundtable meeting</a> — invitees were just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/apple-pushes-the-reset-button-on-the-mac-pro/">Matthew Panzarino</a> , <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/04/apple-reveals-mac-pro-imac-plans/">Lance Ulanoff</a> , <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-to-ditch-the-current-mac-pro-design-but-replacement-wont-arrive--2343465726.html">Ina Fried</a> , <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-says-it-is-completely-rethinking-the-mac-pro">John Paczkowski</a> , and yours truly — to discuss “completely rethinking the Mac Pro”. They issued small speed bumps to the trashcan Mac Pro that day, but didn&#39;t ship the actual completely-rethought Mac Pro <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/">until WWDC 2019</a> . The starting price never changed from $2,999, even when demand for the trashcan models had clearly dropped to near zero. The price was part of the brand. (The starting price for the 2019 Mac Pro: $5,999.)</p><p> Or consider <em>today’s</em> Mac Pro, with the M2 Ultra. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-unveils-new-mac-studio-and-brings-apple-silicon-to-mac-pro/">It debuted alongside Mac Studio models that also came with the M2 Ultra</a> at WWDC 2023 almost two years ago. M2 Ultra Mac Studios <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/06/m2-ultra-mac-studio-review-top-of-the-line/">started at $3,999</a> ; Mac Pros at $6,999. Many observers, quite reasonably, questioned the $3,000 price difference when both computers offered the same chips. The 2023 Mac Pro, in some sense, is just a 2023 Mac Studio in a much bigger case with additional high-performance I/O options. But a month ago Apple debuted <em>M3</em> Ultra Mac Studios, with an unchanged starting price of $3,999. The Mac Pro, still equipped with the older M2 Ultra, still starts at $6,999. Which means that for the time being, you&#39;re not paying $3,000 extra for the same computer in a bigger case, but for a <em>generation-older</em> computer in a bigger case.</p><p> Presumably, M3 Ultra Mac Pros are coming soon, perhaps at WWDC. But until then, the pricing is undeniably weird when compared to the Mac Studio — and many people have thought the pricing was a bit weird compared to the Mac Studio when they were offered with the same M2-generation chips.

Will Trump come to his senses (to some small degree), and declare a nonexistent victory next week and pull these tariffs from the board?

<p>Mike Isaac, writing for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Apple, Dell, Oracle — which rely on hardware and global supply chains that are in the direct line of fire from tariffs — saw their shares go into free-fall. But there was another big tech company whose stock took a pummeling even though its core business has little to do with hardware: Meta. [...]</p><p> The effect of tariffs on Meta&#39;s ad business is simple. Many of its small and medium-sized advertisers are from all across the world. President Trump&#39;s tariffs will instantly make it more expensive for them to sell their products to customers in the United States. [...]</p><p> Last year, the company disclosed that 10 percent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/business/google-meta-temu-shein.html">its revenue in 2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily</a> on advertising across Facebook and Instagram, an ad blitz aimed at garnering a foothold in lucrative Western markets.</p><p> Much of that growth was fueled by the explosive expansion of the fast-fashion company Shein — which is based in Singapore but has a supply chain that is largely in China — and the e-commerce app Temu, a low-cost, Amazon-like company owned by the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Pinduoduo. Temu was estimated to have spent $3 billion in marketing costs in 2023 alone, according to estimates from Bernstein Research.</p></blockquote><p> When the stock market began crumbling after Trump&#39;s announcement Wednesday, I didn&#39;t get why Meta was being hit so hard. Meta makes devices, but unlike Apple, that&#39;s just a side hustle. Meta isn&#39;t a retailer like Amazon. But Meta <em>is</em> a huge advertising destination for retailers.

<p>Bill Gates, commemorating Microsoft&#39;s 50th anniversary:</p><blockquote><p> The story of how Microsoft came to be begins with, of all things, a magazine. The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured an Altair 8800 on the cover. The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics company called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal computer kit that promised to bring computing power to hobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two things: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted to get in on the ground floor.</p><p> At the time, personal computers were practically non-existent. Paul and I knew that creating software that let people program the Altair could revolutionize the way people interacted with these machines. So, we reached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS, and told him we had a version of the programming language BASIC for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p><p> There was just one problem: We didn&#39;t.<br/>是时候上班了。</p></blockquote><p> At the bottom Gates links to a printout of the original source code for the BASIC interpreter, in extensively commented assembly language.

<p>Jason Snell, last month:</p><blockquote><p> The new M4 MacBook Air is the Mac most people should buy. [...]</p><p> That&#39;s why perhaps the most important change in the M4 MacBook Air is its base configuration, which starts at $999. When Apple introduced a winning new flat-with-rounded-corners Air design in 2022, it had to keep selling older models in order to get down under a thousand dollars. Three years later, Apple is finally able to sell a brand-new Air — with a generous 16GB of unified memory — at that important price.</p><p> So: No more quibbles about stepping back a generation or two to an older model with a lower price. Apple has done away with that strategy for the MacBook Air: The latest and greatest model is the one most people shopping for a Mac should buy, especially if they&#39;re coming from an Intel model.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d put off linking to Snell&#39;s review for a few weeks while thinking about writing my own, but I&#39;ve got nothing to add. The M4 MacBook Air is utterly unsurprising, but only in the best possible way. It&#39;s the MacBook Air everyone wanted Apple to make. The $999 base model is now exceedingly recommendable. It even brings back the most notable feature that was lost in the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon — the ability to drive two external displays <em>and</em> its own internal display. Just aces all around.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell’s M4 MacBook Air Review’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/snell-m4-macbook-air">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> US Transaction Shares for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/visa-wanted-a-vast-empire-first-it-had-to-beat-back-its-foes-3b3067f3?mod=article_inline" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41775</id><published> 2025-04-03T23:34:50Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T23:35:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">the previous item</a> , here&#39;s a WSJ report from October on Visa&#39;s dominant position in the payments industry:</p><blockquote><p> Visa, based in San Francisco, has built its network over more than 60 years — going back to clunky manual credit-card readers and carbon-paper copies of receipts. It accounts for around 60% of the total dollar amount of US debit-card purchases and about 50% of US credit-card purchases, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication. Its closest competitor, Mastercard, accounts for around 22% and 23%, respectively. Visa&#39;s profit totaled $17.3 billion in its 2023 fiscal year, after more than tripling in the last decade.</p></blockquote><p> Amex accounts for about 19% of US credit card transactions (and doesn&#39;t support debit), and Discover is down around 3 or 4%. I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it&#39;s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘U.S. Transaction Shares for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WSJ: Visa Offers Apple Roughly $100 Million to Switch Apple Card&#39;s Network From Mastercard </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-card-visa-mastercard-deal-3ce762da" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41774</id><published> 2025-04-03T23:15:38Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T23:28:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AMIc70z-kQ4-ghz686tbG3Q">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The Apple card is up for grabs because Goldman Sachs, the bank behind it, is getting out of the consumer lending world. For months, big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial have been vying to take over as issuer. What hasn&#39;t been known is the equally fierce fight playing out between the networks to win Apple, with Visa and American Express trying to unseat Mastercard, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p> Apple is expected to select a network for the card before it picks the bank to replace Goldman Sachs. Networks provide the plumbing that transmit information between the banks that issue consumers&#39; cards and the merchants&#39; banks.</p><p> Visa, the largest network, has made an aggressive pitch to win the card, including offering the kind of upfront payment to Apple that&#39;s normally reserved for the biggest card programs, the people said. Visa offered a similar payment when Costco was selecting its network about a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p> American Express is also in the mix, trying to become both the issuer and network of the Apple card, the people said. Goldman had approached Amex to gauge its interest in taking over the card in 2023, the Journal earlier reported.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve always thought Visa and Mastercard were interchangeable. I can&#39;t recall ever once in my life seeing an establishment where one of them was accepted but the other wasn&#39;t, and they both seem to be accepted everywhere that accepts credit cards at all. If there&#39;s a reason to prefer one over the other I&#39;ve never heard it.</p><p> Amex is different because it&#39;s accepted at fewer locations because they charge merchants a higher fee, which they get away with because they offer their customers superior service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">I wrote back in 2023</a> that they share an affinity with Apple: both are built around the idea of offering a premium experience and charging higher prices for it.</p><p> But I already have a regular Amex card.

<p>Mike Masnick has a great piece at TechDirt running down just how <em>stupid</em> everything about Trump&#39;s tariff trade war is:</p><blockquote><p> Whoever on the Council of Economic Advisers used this formula should turn in their econ degree, because this is not how anything works. Even if they then go on to <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations">publish another version</a> of the formula that looks all sophisticated and shit.</p></blockquote><p> Brendan Duke, on X, shows that the fancier version of their formula — which is fancy in the way that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/vertu-still-selling-phones">Vertu phones</a> are “fancy” — <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1907741651172311353">is even stupider</a> , because the two Greek letters they chose to glam it up just cancel each other out.</p><p> Back to Masnick:</p><blockquote><p> This is what happens when you ask ChatGPT to “make my wrong econ math look more scientific.” The document even admits that they couldn&#39;t figure out the actual tariff rates, so they “proxied” them with this formula instead. That&#39;s a bit like saying you couldn&#39;t find your house keys, so you proxied them with a banana.</p><p> The fundamental problem here isn&#39;t just that the tariff numbers are wrong — though they absolutely are. It&#39;s that the entire premise rests on treating trade deficits as if they were tariffs. They&#39;re not the same thing.根本。</p><p> Let&#39;s back up for a moment and talk about trade deficits, because Trump has been getting this wrong for longer than some of his supporters have been alive. His logic appears to be:</p><ol><li> “Deficit” sounds bad</li><li> Therefore, trade deficits must be bad</li><li> Therefore, countries with whom we have trade deficits must be cheating us</li><li> Therefore, we should punish them with tariffs to “level the playing field”</li></ol></blockquote><p> This sounds like it must be an exaggeration for comic effect, but it&#39;s not.

<p>The Economist:</p><blockquote><p> On economics Mr Trump&#39;s assertions are flat-out nonsense. The president says tariffs are needed to close America&#39;s trade deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet as any of the president&#39;s economists could have told him, this overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than their country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for over three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs should eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with every trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that each of its suppliers is also a customer.</p><p> And Mr Trump&#39;s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a country&#39;s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks as if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes America&#39;s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported from each country and halves it — which is almost as random as taxing you on the number of vowels in your name.</p></blockquote><p> There is no way to report on these tariffs in a way that is honest and accurate without describing them as bonkers and nonsensical. News publications that are trying to present them as rational, or describing them as “reciprocal” just because that&#39;s the word the White House is using, <a href="https://presswatchers.org/2025/04/mainstream-media-falls-for-trumps-insane-reciprocal-tariff-talk/">are beclowning themselves</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Economist on Trump’s Mindless Tariffs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/the-economist-on-trumps-mindless-tariffs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump Tariffs, Day Two </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-live-updates-stock-market-trade-war.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41771</id><published> 2025-04-03T19:22:23Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T21:01:34Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>CNBC:</p><blockquote><ul><li> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/stock-market-today-live-updates-trump-tariffs.html">Markets plunged</a> the day after President Donald Trump imposed a far-reaching “reciprocal tariff” policy, including a 10% baseline tariff on almost every country on earth.</li><li> The plan slaps much steeper tariff rates on many countries, including 34% on China, 20% on the European Union, 46% on Vietnam and 32% on Taiwan.</li><li> Economists and US trade partners <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">are raising questions</a> about how the White House calculated the tariff rates it claimed other countries “charge” the United States.</li></ul></blockquote><p> Apple, in particular, is taking it on the chin, about 9.5% for the day. Amazon and Meta were both down 9%. Nike is down over 13%. From CNBC&#39;s corresponding story on just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">how the White House computed the “tariff” rates</a> it claims for various countries:</p><blockquote><p> Many observers said the US appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.</p><p> Such methodology doesn&#39;t necessarily align with the conventional approach for calculating tariffs and implies the US would have looked at only the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.</p></blockquote><p> “Such methodology doesn&#39;t necessarily align with the conventional approach” is an overlong euphemism for “The president literally doesn&#39;t understand what tariffs are.” James Surowiecki was seemingly <a href="https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1907559189234196942">the first person to figure out the White House&#39;s nonsensical formula</a> :</p><blockquote><p>只是想出这些假关税率的来源。 They didn&#39;t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country&#39;s exports to us.</p><p> So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us. What extraordinary nonsense this is.</p></blockquote><p> Don&#39;t rack your brain trying to make sense out of the nonsensical.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Trump Tariffs, Day Two’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Nintendo Switch 2 Details </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-details" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41770</id><published> 2025-04-02T15:35:01Z</published><updated> 2025-04-02T15:35:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jon Brodkin, reporting for Ars Technica, “ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/france-fines-apple-e150m-for-excessive-pop-ups-that-let-users-reject-tracking/">France Fines Apple €150M for “Excessive” Pop-Ups That Let Users Reject Tracking</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> France&#39;s competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying the iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up messages that let users consent to or reject tracking that third-party applications use for targeted advertising.</p><p> The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue, said a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">press release</a> today by the Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system harms “smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,” the agency said.</p><p> User consent obtained via the ATT framework “authorizes the application in question to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes,” the agency said. “If consent is given, the application can access the Identifier for Advertisers (&#39;IDFA&#39;), the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use of third-party applications and sites.” The French investigation was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry associations.</p></blockquote><p> Ben Lovejoy, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/31/apple-bizarrely-fined-162m-for-app-tracking-transparency-after-advertisers-complained/">correctly calling the decision “bizarre” at 9to5Mac</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Complaints were made <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/apple-app-tracking/">in a number of countries</a> — some arguing that it was unfair because <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/14/app-tracking-transparency-antitrust/">Apple exempts its own apps</a> (which are in reality subject to even tighter controls), others saying the loss of revenue <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/13/app-tracking-transparency-increases-in-app-purchase-prices/">forced developers to raise prices</a> to compensate. [...]</p><p> Although expected, the decision is still inexplicable. ATT involves precisely <em>one</em> popup asking a simple yes/no question. Additionally, Apple lets users switch on a toggle (shown above) to block apps from even asking the question. It&#39;s especially odd given that ATT is a privacy feature, and Europe has the strongest privacy laws in the world. The EU <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/03/ad-tracking-rules/">has also previously vindicated</a> Apple&#39;s introduction of ATT.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s not inexplicable or odd if you view the decision as coming from a perspective where government bureaucracy is viewed as an inherent good, and well-intentioned process is all that matters, not actual results. Read the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> ’s decision ( <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">which they helpfully do make available in English</a> ) and it&#39;s pretty clear:</p><blockquote><p> The <em>Autorité</em> found that the ATT framework imposed by Apple is not necessary, insofar as the consent obtained is not valid under the applicable laws, in particular the French Data Protection Act.</p><p> In practice, the fact that publishers that so wish cannot rely on the ATT framework to comply with their legal obligations means that they must continue to use their own consent collection solutions, known as consent management platforms (“CMPs”). The result is that multiple consent pop-ups are displayed, making the use of third-party applications in the iOS environment excessively complex, as observed by the French data protection authority ( <em>Commission nationale de l&#39;informatique et des libertés</em> — CNIL) in a 2022 opinion issued at the request of the <em>Autorité</em> .</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s ostensibly “not necessary” because French and EU privacy laws are supposedly enough, and all that&#39;s needed. And it&#39;s unfair because now, under ATT, third-party surveillance advertisers who seek to track users across apps on iOS need to ask permission twice — first through the clear-as-a-bell “Ask App Not to Track” / “Allow Tracking” prompt required by Apple, and again through the byzantine but ultimately toothless permission requirements of France and the EU. ATT has had measurable effects because users understand it, and they prefer not to be tracked. EU and French privacy laws are largely ineffective because, in practice, they <a href="https://hep.physics.illinois.edu/home/g-gollin/1984_commercial_dialogue.html">bury users with confusion</a> . The bureaucratic hurdles they impose are to the benefit, not detriment, of the surveillance ad industry. That&#39;s now proven out by industry groups — the ones ATT successfully tempered — successfully getting France&#39;s regulators to penalize Apple. <em>Users</em> don&#39;t know how to lobby government bureaucracies. What the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> is saying, in so many words, is that two layers of consent is too much, and the only one that&#39;s necessary is the one that advertising lobbying groups <em>don&#39;t object to</em> , not the one they do (but which users understand and like).</p><p> It&#39;s clear that only one of these two things — Apple&#39;s ATT or French/EU privacy regulations — was actually effective at reducing tracking: ATT. No one claimed that French or EU privacy laws resulted in Meta losing a fortune because they had to adjust their kleptomaniacal thievery of users&#39; privacy. But by all accounts, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/">including Meta&#39;s own</a> , <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/04/23/apple-just-issued-stunning-12-billion-blow-to-facebook/">ATT cost Meta billions</a> . And yes, ATT hurt small businesses too — small businesses that were built upon surreptitious tracking that users had neither awareness of nor control over. It&#39;s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a popular retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers&#39; business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.</p><p> App Tracking Transparency actually accomplished, in practice, via user-focused plain-language consent, what the EU&#39;s privacy laws were intended to do but do not. This fine boils down to France declaring that Apple shouldn&#39;t have actually done what the EU was pretending to do.

<p>Brian Steinberg and Pat Saperstein, reporting for Variety over the weekend:</p><blockquote><p> The White House Correspondents&#39; Association has canceled plans to have comedian Amber Ruffin perform at its annual dinner on April 26, a new sign of the pressures being brought to bear on news organizations during President Donald Trump&#39;s second term.</p><p> The journalism group, which has seen its control over interactions with Trump eroded in recent weeks, made the decision after Taylor Budowich, a White House deputy chief of staff, raised comments Ruffin has made in the past that are critical of Trump. Earlier this week, Ruffin told a podcast backed by The Daily Beast that she would not try to make sure her jokes targeted all sides of the political spectrum as the WHCA had requested, and likened the Trump administration to “kind of a bunch of murderers.” Playing to both sides “makes them feel like human beings,” she said, “cause they&#39;re not.” [...]</p><p> “The WHCA board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring a comedic performance this year. At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists,” WHCA president Eugene Daniels wrote to members in a statement.</p><p> “For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year,” he added. “As the date nears, I will share more details of the plans in place to honor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent media covering the most powerful office in the world.”</p></blockquote><p> What an enormous mountain of obvious horseshit this explanation is. The WHCA only announced that Ruffin would be hosting this year&#39;s show on February 4, at which point this lickspittle clown Eugene Daniels <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/amber-ruffin-2025-white-house-correspondents-dinner-1236126815/">was quoted thus by The Hollywood Reporter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “When I began to think about what entertainer would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year, Amber was immediately at the top of my list,” Eugene Daniels of Politico, president of the association, said in a statement on Tuesday. “She has the ability to walk the line between blistering commentary and humor all while provoking her audience to think about the important issues of the day. I&#39;m thrilled and honored she said yes.”</p></blockquote><p> So eight weeks ago this obsequious bootlicker Daniels thought Amber Ruffin “would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year” but now, four weeks before the show, he&#39;s trying to claim with a straight face that “For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year”?</p><p> The kids magazine Highlights for Children has a long-running comic strip called “Goofus and Gallant”, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/06/goofus-and-gallant-american-parenting-highlights/674536/">the premise of which</a> is that Goofus is a kid who always does the wrong thing, and Gallant always does the right thing. Goofus, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/goofus-gallant-1948.jpg">especially in the older strips</a> , is an absurd parody. This Eugene Daniels toady is the Goofus of journalism. The entire point of the WHCA is to assert the group&#39;s collective independence as journalists — and the independence they assert is specifically from the White House. So of course they shouldn&#39;t have responded to White House pressure to fire Ruffin as this year&#39;s host. But it&#39;s even worse for an ostensible journalist — the president of the WHCA for chrissakes — to try to get even a single person in the world to believe that this is anything other than caving to White House pressure, and that in fact (“ <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k">Yeah, that&#39;s the ticket!</a></em> ”) he&#39;d been planning to cancel the entire concept of having a comedian host at all “for the past couple of weeks” when just eight weeks ago he described Ruffin as “a perfect fit for the dinner this year”.</p><p> This is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/baghdad-bob-and-his-ridiculous-true-predictions/274241/">Baghdad Bob</a> level nonsense. I&#39;m not one for performative resignations, but how does any news outlet or journalist agree to remain a member of the WHCA after this?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The White House Correspondents Association Speaks Cowardice to Power’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/31/whca-speaks-cowardice-to-power">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Lex.Games </title><link href="https://lex.games/df" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w80" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/lex-games" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41760</id><published> 2025-03-30T22:25:00Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T22:30:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Lex Friedman for sponsoring this past week at DF to promote Lex.Games, a collection of eight daily word games. Quoting from Friedman&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/lexgames_free_daily_word_games">own description in the sponsored RSS entry</a> at the start of the week:</p><blockquote><p> I paid Gruber many thousands of dollars to run this ad for free games which themselves have no ads. Please keep reading.</p><p> The games:</p><p> <em>Conlextions:</em> Inspired by NYT&#39;s Connections<br/> <em>Lexicogs:</em> Solve crossword-style clues by assembling letter “cogs”<br/> <em>By a Vowel:</em> A word jumble game with missing vowels<br/> <em>Six Appeal:</em> Wordle with six-letter words</p><p> There&#39;s also a daily <em>Mini Crossword</em> ; a <em>Full-Size Crossword</em> ; and <em>Mind Control</em> , which is a whole lot like Mastermind and not actually a word game at all; don&#39;t sue me.</p><p> Oh, and if you only counted seven games here, the eighth is iOS-only. It&#39;s called Letter Opener, and it&#39;s my favorite.</p></blockquote><p> I actually hate Letter Opener, because I&#39;m terrible at games like that. Looking at the leaderboard, though, obviously some of you are really good at it. Six Appeal is more my speed (which is to say, like Wordle, it has no clock). But go ahead and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lex-games-daily-word-games/id6498941705">download the iOS app and try Letter Opener</a> . Maybe you&#39;re a fast enough thinker for it.</p><p> So the basic pitch is that Lex.Games really is just a bunch of fun daily games that are free to play, without ads (let alone without <em>annoying</em> ads). But you can — and should! — pay a modest $20/year to subscribe to get access to extra games, leaderboards, and just to support a very fun and satisfying endeavor.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Lex.Games’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/lex-games">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Vertu Is Still Selling Phones, Which Suggests Someone Is Still Buying Them </title><link href="https://vertu.com/product-category/phones/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w82" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/vertu-still-selling-phones" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41762</id><published> 2025-03-30T22:24:30Z</published><updated> 2025-03-31T15:47:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>With season 2 of <em>Severance</em> complete (with a remarkable bang), Apple TV+ has slid right into a new prestige series, <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/247767-the-studio?language=en-US">The Studio</a></em> , starring (and co-created by) Seth Rogen as the newly-appointed chief of the fictional and dysfunctional Continental Studios in Hollywood.</p><p> Two episodes in (out of 10 for the debut season), and it is fucking amazing. So far it feels a bit like a cross between <em>Entourage</em> , <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em> , <em>Boogie Nights</em> , and maybe a touch of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> . But the biggest influence and inspiration is clearly Robert Altman&#39;s 1992 masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10403-the-player?language=en-US">The Player</a></em> , almost certainly the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood moviemaking that ever was or will be made.</p><p> What <em>The Studio</em> and <em>The Player</em> share is that they&#39;re about the struggle to create great cinematic art within a corporate studio world run by unartistic know-it-all self-important status-obsessed dullards driven by formula and fads — and, simultaneously, they are themselves almost unfathomably complicated and intricate works of cinematic art. They <em>are</em> what they&#39;re <em>about</em> . They achieve what the characters within them fear is no longer achievable. When you get to episode 2 of <em>The Studio</em> , just keep asking yourself “Wait, <em>how</em> are they getting this shot?” The lighting, my god. The whole thing is just an outpouring of homage to <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/opening-shots-the-player">the opening shot of <em>The Player</em></a> , which of course itself calls back, <a href="https://filmotomy.com/quiet-on-the-set-breaking-down-the-opening-shot-in-altmans-the-player/">explicitly</a> , to Orson Welles&#39;s <em>Touch of Evil</em> .</p><p> <em>The Studio</em> is, thus far, engaging, surprising, funny, gorgeous, clever, and cinematically ambitious. It&#39;s really quite a thing. I have no idea what&#39;s coming in episodes 3–10, so maybe this piece will look a bit premature, if not foolish, in two months. But if the rest of season one is anything like the first two episodes, <em>The Studio</em> is a classic in the making.</p><p> The thought also occurs to me that this might be the don&#39;t-over-think-it answer to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost">just what the hell Apple is doing making original shows and movies</a> in the first place. Perhaps Apple&#39;s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but <em>champions</em> . And that in a media landscape where such champions of cinema-as-art and art-as-an-essential-public-good are fewer and fewer, it is Apple&#39;s not just opportunity but <em>obligation</em> to step up to the plate.</p><p> I&#39;ve long thought that one of the minor tragedies of Steve Jobs&#39;s second act is that the timing just didn&#39;t work out to sell Pixar to Apple, instead of to Disney. But make no mistake, a love and appreciation for great cinema is not outside Apple&#39;s DNA. No streamer has a higher hit rate for quality shows. Their movies mostly stink so far, but maybe that&#39;s just the learning curve. <em>The Gorge</em> , for example, feels like an Apple TV movie because it&#39;s so decidedly meh. Not horrible, but not good in any way beyond its intriguing elevator-pitch concept. <em>Wolfs</em> was better but still a grand disappointment given its pedigree. But when it comes to shows, no one is doing better. <em>Severance</em> deserves all its acclaim and attention, and Ben Stiller delivered a season 2 finale that&#39;s arguably the best 78 minutes of filmmaking I&#39;ve seen this decade. And <em>The Studio</em> , to me, <em>feels</em> like an Apple TV show — not because of how it looks, what it&#39;s about, or who&#39;s in it, but simply because it&#39;s so good. Netflix almost never makes shows like this. Neither does HBO now that&#39;s its been subsumed by “Max”. Peacock et al don&#39;t even try. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-30"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-30">1</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-30"><p> One more A+ recommendation: <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/219971-the-agency">The Agency</a></em> on Paramount+. Michael Fassbender, Jeffrey Wright, Richard Gere, a breakout searing performance by Jodie Turner-Smith, and a great supporting cast in a super-smart, hyper-realistic-feeling spy-thriller/mystery/love story. Gorgeous cinematography too. Just so good in a “feels like it should have been on Apple TV+” way, sort of like how it was so obvious right from S1.E1 that HBO fucked up big-time by passing on <em>Mad Men</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-30"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;The Studio&#39; Is Fantastic So Far</title></entry><entry><title> MacOS 15 Sequoia&#39;s Annoying-as-Hell &#39;Turn On Reactions&#39; Menu Bar Prompt </title><link href="https://birchtree.me/blog/this-alert-must-die/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/birchler-sequoia-turn-on-reactions" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41758</id><published> 2025-03-30T18:20:51Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T18:20:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">the iPhone X was announced alongside the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus</a> in mid-September. The iPhones 8 shipped that month, and I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">a review of the iPhones 8</a> on September 19. The iPhone X, though, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">wasn&#39;t available to order until October 27</a> , and didn&#39;t start shipping to customers until November 3. It was an unusual iPhone release cycle that year, to say the least. Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I&#39;d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo dropped, so I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">some initial impressions then</a> , but wound up not publishing my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">full review of the iPhone X</a> until December 26.</p><p> A few days later I wrote a follow-up regarding a specific new interaction design, “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">Pressing the Side Button to Confirm Payments on iPhone X</a> ”, which I began thus:</p><blockquote><p> Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from Hacker News. It&#39;s always short-lived, because for reasons I&#39;ve never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles always get blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It&#39;s apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it&#39;s a shame the articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who don&#39;t like Daring Fireball.</p><p> Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage, though, the comment threads still exist. I went through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">the Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review</a> today, and a few comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my attention.</p></blockquote><p> What I didn&#39;t mention then was that DF&#39;s buried status at HN was, at the time, a relatively new phenomenon. Hacker News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">started in early 2007</a> and for a yearslong stretch, Daring Fireball articles seemed more or less appropriately popular there. Articles that I would think would resonate with the HN readership would hit, and get what always seemed to me an appropriate number of comments. At some point in the mid-2010s though, it seemed like DF articles would get downvoted or flagged after hitting the HN front page. I&#39;d been noticing this for some time when I wrote the above in December 2017.</p><p> But even in 2017, DF articles would get active comment threads on HN occasionally. The Hacker News thread I referenced above, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">regarding my iPhone X review</a> , garnered 107 comments. In the years after that, DF articles went from being mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> hitting the HN front page (and gaining some comment traction) to pretty much <em>never</em> hitting the HN front page (and thus never gaining any comment traction). I found this curious, and I couldn&#39;t figure out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">why or how</a> this was happening — or who was doing it — but I didn&#39;t mention it much.</p><p> Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">I did mention it again in a footnote</a> , in a piece about the inexplicably poor state of Android apps from a design perspective:</p><blockquote><p> It sounds a bit conspiratorial, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">for several years now</a> it&#39;s seemed clear to me that Hacker News has Daring Fireball in some sort of graylist. It&#39;s not blacklisted, obviously, given the aforementioned <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">two</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">threads</a> about yesterday&#39;s piece, but nothing I write here ever gains any significant traction there.曾经。 And the reason there are two threads for yesterday&#39;s piece is that the first one disappeared from the home page soon after it was posted.我认为？ In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">this list of recent Hacker News threads for articles from DF</a> , going back four months, only three have more than 10 comments — and two of those are the threads from yesterday. I don&#39;t know who I pissed off there or why, but I&#39;ve never seen an explanation for this. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN commenter Michiel de Mare has quantified the apparent suppression</a> , based on the ranking of this very article. Exactly what I&#39;ve noticed for years.</p></blockquote><p> You can see this yourself right now, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the current list of recent DF articles submitted to Hacker News</a> . Most of them have 0, 1, or 2 comments. Some got up to 3. “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a> ” is the most read, most commented upon thing I&#39;ve written in a while. On Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">it got just 28 comments</a> before being shitlisted, which, I have to say, is just weird. That&#39;s one piece I&#39;d have thought would resonate with the HN audience, and make for good grist for discussion. Then, after the original thread was shitlisted, someone re-submitted it (perhaps confused that it wasn&#39;t on the HN front page). That re-submission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">got 1 comment</a> before it too fell to the mysterious shitlist reaper.</p><p> The one recent exception is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">Why Can&#39;t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</a> ”, which somehow <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">escaped the shitlist and garnered 208 comments</a> . These occasional exceptions to DF&#39;s general shitlisting at HN have always made the whole thing more mysterious to me. There&#39;s clearly no programmatic blacklisting that keeps Daring Fireball articles from being submitted, or from gaining a few comments. But once any traction occurs, <em>something</em> happens and poof, they&#39;re gone from the Hacker News front page. It certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense to me why my off-hand post griping about our inability to screenshot DRM video frames would be an order of magnitude more popular than “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino” was.</p><p> Today, though, I saw <a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">a helpful mention on Mastodon</a> that pointed me to an interesting project. An author named Michael Lynch has written a tool to quantify “ <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">the highest-ranking personal blogs of Hacker News</a> ” since HN&#39;s inception in 2007. According to Lynch&#39;s all-time listing, Daring Fireball ranks #5, which I have to say surprised me, given its years of inexplicable (or at the very least, unexplained) shitlisting status. But Lynch&#39;s tool lets you select date ranges. If you look at <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 through 2021</a> , Daring Fireball ranked #3, behind only <a href="https://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham&#39;s renowned eponymous blog</a> and Brian Krebs&#39;s excellent (and also eponymous) <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</a> . From <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 though 2013</a> , DF ranked #2, behind only Graham (who created Hacker News). But if you look at the last four years, from <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021 through 2025</a> , Daring Fireball ranks #72.</p><p> Maybe I&#39;ve lost my fastball, and I just don&#39;t write so good no more. Or maybe it&#39;s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup> But it seems to me <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">there&#39;s something fishy going on</a> . What bothers me isn&#39;t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgruber">still do</a> when one slips through the cracks. What bothers me is that it&#39;s unexplained. Which, ultimately, seems not so much censorial as just cowardly.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-26"><p> You&#39;d think there&#39;d be a certain kinship between decades-old websites, typeset in small-point Verdana, which stubbornly refuse to update their general layout and design. <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The Website That Hacker News Is Afraid to Discuss (You&#39;re Reading It)</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
