<p>随着<em>遣散</em>的第2季完整（带有出色的爆炸），Apple TV+已经进入了一个新的Prestige系列， <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/247767-the-studio?language=en-US">The Studio</a></em> ，由塞斯·罗根（Seth Rogan）主演（并共同创建）塞斯·罗根（Seth Rogan），是好莱坞的虚构和功能障碍大陆工作室的新任负责人。</p><p>两集（第10集中的第10集），这真是太神奇了。到目前为止，感觉有点像<em>随行人员</em>之间的十字架，<em>拉里·桑德斯（Larry Sanders）表演</em>，<em>布吉（Boogie）夜晚</em>，也许有些<em>遏制了您的热情</em>。但是，最大的影响力和灵感显然是罗伯特·奥特曼（Robert Altman）1992年的杰作《<em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10403-the-player?language=en-US">玩家》（The Player）</a></em> ，几乎可以肯定是好莱坞最好的电影，讲述了有史以来或将要制作的好莱坞电影制作。</p><p><em>工作室</em>和<em>玩家的</em>分享是，他们是在努力在由不自在的知识群体中创作出伟大的电影艺术的斗争，这是由一个由公式和时尚驱动的全部自我重要的地位痴迷的呆板 - 同时，它们本身几乎是令人难以置信的复杂而复杂的电影艺术作品。他们<em>就是</em>他们的<em>意思</em>。他们实现了他们内在的角色恐惧已不再是可以实现的。当您进入<em>工作室</em>的第2集时，请继续问自己：“等等，他们<em>如何</em>获得这张照片？”照明，我的上帝。整个事情只是向<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/opening-shots-the-player"><em>玩家</em>开场镜头的</a>敬意，当然，这本身<a href="https://filmotomy.com/quiet-on-the-set-breaking-down-the-opening-shot-in-altmans-the-player/">就</a>向奥森·韦尔斯（Orson Welles）的<em>邪恶触摸了</em>。</p><p>到目前为止，<em>该工作室</em>引人入胜，令人惊讶，有趣，华丽，聪明和电影雄心勃勃。这确实是一回事。我不知道第3-10集将发生什么，所以也许这件作品在两个月内看起来还为时过早，即使不是愚蠢的话。但是，如果第一季的其余时间就像前两集一样，<em>则该录音室</em>就是制作中的经典。</p><p>在我看来，这个想法可能是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost">对苹果公司首先在做原创节目和电影的地狱</a>的回答。也许苹果公司的领导才能像我一样相信电影是世界上最宏伟，最伟大的艺术形式 - 包括演戏，写作，摄影和/或插图以及音乐的表演，写作，摄影和插图以及音乐 - 但伟大的电影院既昂贵又微妙，需要，来自精力充沛的工作室和他们更昂贵的公司父母，比顾客更多，但更多的是<em>顾客</em>。而且，在这样的媒体景观中，这类电影冠军是艺术品，而Art-As-As-As-As-As-An-Asential-Public Good则越来越少，这不仅是苹果的机会，而且是<em>义务</em>上台。</p><p>我长期以来一直以为史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）第二幕的一小部分是，时机并没有解决将皮克斯（Pixar）出售给苹果而不是给迪士尼的时机。但是毫无疑问，对伟大电影的爱与欣赏并不是苹果的DNA之外。没有流媒体的质量表演率更高。到目前为止，他们的电影大部分都臭了，但这也许只是学习曲线。例如，<em>峡谷</em>感觉就像是一部Apple电视电影，因为它是如此坚定。不恐怖，但在任何有趣的电梯概念之外都不是好的。<em>沃尔夫斯</em>更好，但鉴于其血统，仍然是一个巨大的失望。但是，在演出方面，没有人做得更好。 <em>Severance</em>值得一提和关注，Ben Stiller发表了第2季的大结局，这可以说是我这十年看过的最好的86分钟电影制作。对我来说，<em>工作室</em><em>感觉</em>就像是一个苹果电视节目 - 不是因为它的外观，是什么或谁在其中，而是因为它是如此的好。 Netflix几乎从未做过这样的节目。 HBO现在也没有“ Max”所包含。孔雀等人甚至都不尝试。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-30"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-30">1</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-30"><p>另一种A+建议：派拉蒙+的<em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/219971-the-agency">代理</a></em>。迈克尔·法斯宾德（Michael Fassbender），杰弗里·赖特（Jeffrey Wright），理查德·吉尔（Richard Gere），乔迪·特纳·史密斯（Jodie Turner-Smith）的突破性灼热表演，以及在超级聪明，超现实的间谍表演者/神秘/爱情故事的超级聪明，超现实的演员中。华丽的摄影。在“感觉应该在Apple TV+上的感觉”中，真是太好了，就像S1.E1相比，HBO通过传递<em>疯子</em>而大不了不时。 <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-30"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★到目前为止，“工作室”很棒</title></entry><entry><title>MacOS 15红杉的烦人 - 正当“打开反应”菜单栏提示</title><link href="https://birchtree.me/blog/this-alert-must-die/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/birchler-sequoia-turn-on-reactions" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41758</id><published> 2025-03-30T18：20：51Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T18：20：52Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>早在2017年， <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">iPhone X与iPhone 8和8 Plus一起于9月中旬宣布</a>。 iPhone 8当月发货，我在9月19日发表了<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">iPhone 8的评论。</a>不过，<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">直到10月27日，iPhone X才可用</a>，直到11月3日才开始向客户发货。至少这是当年的一个不寻常的iPhone发行周期，至少可以说。备受期待的iPhone X的初步评论出现在10月31日，但是当禁运下降时，我只有24小时的电话，所以我发表了<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">一些初步印象</a>，但是最终没有发布我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">对iPhone X的完整评论，</a>直到12月26日。</p><p>几天<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">之后</a></p><blockquote><p>有时候，我注意到黑客新闻中大胆的火球的交通繁忙。它总是短暂的，因为出于我从未见过的原因，大胆的火球文章一旦进入头版就将其列入黑客新闻。显然，许多HN读者都不喜欢我的作品，因为他们将我视为无耻的苹果shill，但可惜的是，这些文章被删除了，因为我喜欢阅读评论。我觉得这让我保持脚趾阅读不喜欢大胆火球的人的评论。</p><p>不过，即使在黑客新闻主页上被黑名单列入黑名单之后，评论主题仍然存在。我今天<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">在iPhone X评论上浏览了黑客新闻评论</a>，有关苹果薪水在iPhone X上的工作方式引起了我的注意。</p></blockquote><p>那时我没有提到的是，当时，DF在HN的地位是一种相对较新的现象。 Hacker News<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">始于2007年初</a>，长达数年的时间，大胆的火球文章似乎或多或少地在那里很受欢迎。我认为会引起HN读者的共鸣的文章将会受到关注，并在我看来总是有适当数量的评论。不过，在2010年代中期的某个时刻，DF文章似乎在登上HN首页后会被裁员或标记。当我在2017年12月写上述文章时，我已经注意到了一段时间。</p><p>但是即使在2017年，DF文章偶尔也会在HN上获得主动评论。我上面引用的<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">有关iPhone X评论的</a>黑客新闻线程获得了107条评论。在此之后的几年中，DF文章从击中HN的头版（并获得一些评论牵引力）<em>后</em>，从神秘地消失，几乎<em>永远不会</em>击中HN首页（因此从未获得任何评论牵引力）。我发现这个好奇，我无法弄清楚<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">为什么</a>会发生这种情况，或者是谁这样做的 - 但我没有提到太多。</p><p>两年前，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">我确实在脚注中再次提到了它</a>，这是从设计的角度来看，关于莫名其妙的Android应用程序状态：</p><blockquote><p>听起来有点阴谋，但是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">几年来，</a>我似乎很清楚，黑客新闻在某种灰色清单中大胆地火球了。显然，鉴于上述有关昨天作品的<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">两个</a><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">线程</a>，它并没有被黑名单，但是我在这里写的任何东西都没有在那里获得任何重要的牵引力。曾经。昨天的文章有两个线程的原因是，第一个线程在发布后不久就从主页上消失了。我认为？在<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">此近期有关DF文章的黑客新闻线程的清单</a>中，可以追溯到四个月，只有3个有10条评论，其中两个是昨天的线程。我不知道我在那里生气或为什么，但我从未见过对此的解释。<strong>更新：</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN评论者Michiel de Mare根据本文的排名量化了明显的抑制</a>。正是我多年来注意到的。</p></blockquote><p>您现在可以自己看到这一点，<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">其中最新的DF文章列表提交给Hacker News</a> 。他们中的大多数都有0、1或2条评论。有些人最多可达3。“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">库比蒂诺的状态烂了</a>”是最阅读的，大多数评论了我一段时间以来写的东西。在黑客新闻上，<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">它只有28条评论</a>，然后才被列入粪便，我不得不说，这很奇怪。我认为这是一件会引起HN观众的共鸣，并为讨论提供了良好的讨论。然后，在将原始线程列入粪便后，有人重新提交了它（也许不在HN首页上）。该重新提出的评论<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">也得到了1条评论，</a>然后才归结为神秘的垃圾清单收割者。</p><p>最近的一个例外是：“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">为什么我们不能从Apple设备上的DRM保护视频中屏幕截图？</a> ”，这以某种方式<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">逃脱了shitlist并获得了208条评论</a>。这些偶尔在HN的普遍狗屎清单的例外总是使整个事情对我更加神秘。显然，没有程序化的黑名单使大胆的火球文章被提交或发表一些评论。但是，一旦发生任何牵引力，就会发生<em>某些事情</em>并po，它们从黑客新闻头版走了。当然，这对我来说毫无意义，为什么我对我们无法屏蔽DRM视频框架的副手的帖子比“库比蒂诺州腐烂的东西”更受欢迎的数量级。</p><p>不过，今天，我看到了<a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">对Mastodon的有用提及，</a>这将我指向了一个有趣的项目。一位名叫Michael Lynch的作者写了一项工具来量化自2007年HN成立以来的“<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">黑客新闻的最高个人博客</a>”。根据Lynch的历史上的清单，Daring Fireball排名第五，我不得不对我感到惊讶，鉴于它至少多年不可思议（或至少可以解释，毫无解释的状态）。但是Lynch的工具使您可以选择日期范围。如果您查看<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007年至2021年</a>，大胆的火球排名第3，仅次于<a href="https://paulgraham.com/">保罗·格雷厄姆（Paul Graham）著名的同名博客</a>和布莱恩·克雷布斯（Brian Krebs）的出色（也是同名的）<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">克雷布斯（Krebs</a> ）。从<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007年开始，2013年</a>，DF排名第二，仅次于Graham（谁创建了Hacker News）。但是，如果您看着过去四年，从<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021年到2025年</a>，大胆的火球排名第72。</p><p>也许我失去了快球，而且我再也没有写得很好了。也许不是我，而是近年来黑客新闻观众发生了变化。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup>但是在我看来<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">，有些腥的事情正在发生</a>。让我感到困扰的不是大胆的火球在黑客新闻上被弄糟了 -

<p>保罗·卡法西斯（Paul Kafasis）：</p><blockquote><p>由于去年首次启用了它们，因此我经常发现Apple Intelligence的通知摘要，即电子邮件不大。这是我在过去几天里发现的一些。</p></blockquote><p>其中第一个特别有趣，因为它突出了LLM令人沮丧的关键领域。卡法西斯（Kafasis）收到了苹果情报公司（Apple Intelligence）的通知摘要，声称他购买的一本二手书，声称“以$ 427的订单发货”。 Apple Intelligence收集到的Amazon的电子邮件的价格是这样的：4²$  - 省略了十进制，将美分放在上标。到目前为止，这是一个数百年来的格式化习语，<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=walmart+price+sign&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">例如在沃尔玛</a>- 在沃尔玛。但是，苹果情报局只看到了美元签名，四个，二，七，因此$ 427。</p><p>那只是愚蠢的。</p><p>但是，真正令人沮丧的地方是每个人都必须在某个时候学习这一点。 If you were at Walmart with a kid, and the kid asked why, say, dog food is so expensive, pointing to a sign that says it cost $9⁸⁷ per bag, you&#39;d explain it, once, and the kid would never forget it. “ <em>Oh, that&#39;s just another way of writing nine dollars and eighty-seven cents — they do it that way to emphasize the dollar amount and de-emphasize the cents, which really don&#39;t matter.</em> ” This would make intuitive sense to the child as well, because they know dog food probably costs about $10 per bag, not $1,000 per bag.</p><p> There is no way to properly explain something like this to an LLM (yet?). You can&#39;t teach it like we do with children. Or at least you can&#39;t do it in a way that jibes with our human sense of “learning” — it&#39;s more like how the Guy Pearce protagonist “learns” in Christopher Nolan&#39;s <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/77-memento?language=en-US">Memento</a></em> . <em>Here, tattoo another thing to remember on your arm.</em> But at least ChatGPT is <em>trying</em> to learn about us, albeit in its crude <em>Memento</em> -like way. With Apple Intelligence in particular, you can&#39;t teach it <em>at all</em> . There&#39;s no place in the system where you can correct the very simple, easily-explained mistake it made upon seeing <em>$4²⁷</em> in an email. The next time an email from Amazon comes with a price formatted like that, Apple Intelligence is likely to summarize it the exact same wrong way — off by a factor of 100 — again. And there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Notification Summary Miscues’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/notification-summary-miscues">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> OPSEC Isn&#39;t Even the Worst Part of &#39;SignalGate&#39; </title><link href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/signalgate-is-bad-but-opsec-isnt-even-the-worst-part-of-it" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/opsec-not-the-worst-of-it" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41747</id><published> 2025-03-25T20:37:23Z</published><updated> 2025-03-25T20:37:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Josh Marshal, writing at Talking Points Memo:</p><blockquote><p> Especially in the national security domain, many things the government does have to remain secret. Sometimes those things remain secret for years or decades. But they&#39;re not secrets <em>from</em> the US government. The US government owns all those communications, all those facts of its own history. Using a Signal app like this is hiding what&#39;s happening from the government itself. And that is almost certainly not an unintended byproduct but the very reason for the use. These are disappearing communications. They won&#39;t be in the National Archives. Future administrations won&#39;t know what happened. There also won&#39;t be any records to determine whether crimes were committed.</p><p> This all goes to the fundamental point Trump has never been able to accept: that the US government is the property of the American people and it persists over time with individual officeholders merely temporary occupants charged with administering an entity they don&#39;t own or possess.</p><p> Think this is hyperbole? Remember that when Trump held his notorious meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in 2019 he confiscated his translator&#39;s notes and ordered him not to divulge anything that had been discussed. Remember that Trump got impeached over an extortion plot recorded in the government record of his phone call with President Zelensky. An intelligence analyst discovered what had happened and decided he needed to report the conduct. These aren&#39;t hypotheticals. They&#39;ve already happened. And he&#39;s even been caught.

<p>Maggie Miller and Dana Nickel, reporting for Politico:</p><blockquote><p> The app&#39;s security is viewed as fairly strong due to its robust privacy features and minimal data collection, as well as default end-to-end encryption of all messages and voice calls. The app also includes a function that deletes all messages from a conversation within a set time frame, adding an additional layer of data protection. But experts agree that it shouldn&#39;t be used by government officials as an alternative to communicating through more secure, sanctioned government communications — which Signal is not.</p><p> “It&#39;s so unbelievable,” a former White House official, granted anonymity to discuss The Atlantic&#39;s report candidly, said Monday. “These guys all have traveling security details to set up secure comms for them, wherever they are.”</p></blockquote><p> Signal&#39;s encryption is more than just “fairly strong”. It&#39;s very strong, arguably the gold standard in consumer-available communications. But that&#39;s not the point. The point is it&#39;s a consumer application. This whole fiasco happened because you can just mistakenly add the wrong person to a group conversation, which wouldn&#39;t be possible if the Trump national security team were using appropriate channels.</p><p> And the disappearing messages thing doesn&#39;t add security. It adds some level of privacy, but it&#39;s an additional factor that makes all of this completely illegal. But avoiding any future scrutiny is almost certainly one reason Trump&#39;s kakistocratic cabinet is using Signal in the first place.</p><blockquote><p> The former White House official pointed out that members of Trump&#39;s Cabinet — including the vice president, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, among others — were likely using personal devices, <a href="https://fedscoop.com/usaid-policy-signal-telegram-third-party-messaging-apps/">since in most cases</a> , Signal cannot be downloaded onto official federal devices. This alone creates a host of cybersecurity issues.</p></blockquote><p> Wrote one DF reader (who has professional experience in this area) to me today, “There is no legal way whatsoever that classified information can be communicated over the public Internet — private device, personally owned device, Chromebook, anything. It is all wildly illegal.”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Problem Is Far More Than Just Whether Signal Is ‘Secure’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/the-problem-is-far-more-than-just-whether-signal-is-secure">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Days After the Trump National Security Team&#39;s Signal Leak, the Pentagon Warned That Russian Hackers Are Using Phishing Attacks to Abuse Signal&#39;s &#39;Linked Devices&#39; Feature </title><link href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/25/nx-s1-5339801/pentagon-email-signal-vulnerability" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/pentagon-signal-linked-devices" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41745</id><published> 2025-03-25T20:19:15Z</published><updated> 2025-03-25T21:00:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>美国国家公共电台：</p><blockquote><p> Several days after top national security officials accidentally included a reporter in a Signal chat about bombing Houthi sites in Yemen, a Pentagon-wide advisory warned against using the messaging app, even for unclassified information.</p><p> “A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger application,” begins the department-wide email, dated March 18, obtained by NPR. The memo continues, “Russian professional hacking groups are employing the &#39;linked devices&#39; features to spy on encrypted conversations.” It notes that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger">Google has identified</a> Russian hacking groups who are “targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s not a weakness in Signal&#39;s cryptography, it&#39;s a hole in their device-mirroring setup. From that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger">Google Threat Intelligence post</a> , published last month:</p><blockquote><p> The most novel and widely used technique underpinning Russian-aligned attempts to compromise Signal accounts is the abuse of the app&#39;s legitimate “ <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320551-Linked-Devices">linked devices</a> ” feature that enables Signal to be used on multiple devices concurrently. Because linking an additional device typically requires scanning a quick-response (QR) code, threat actors have resorted to crafting malicious QR codes that, when scanned, will link a victim&#39;s account to an actor-controlled Signal instance. If successful, future messages will be delivered synchronously to both the victim and the threat actor in real-time, providing a persistent means to eavesdrop on the victim&#39;s secure conversations without the need for full-device compromise.</p></blockquote><p> You&#39;d have to be a bit of a doofus to fall for such a phishing attack if you were in a national security leadership position, but, well, our national security leadership positions are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/trump-admin-included-goldberg-in-yemen-war-plan-signal-group">currently occupied</a> by what the Russians call “useful idiots”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Days After the Trump National Security Team’s Signal Leak, the Pentagon Warned That Russian Hackers Are Using Phishing Attacks to Abuse Signal’s ‘Linked Devices’ Feature’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/pentagon-signal-linked-devices">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> New York Post: &#39;European Union to Fine Meta Up to $1B or More for Breaching DMA&#39; </title><link href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/24/business/european-union-to-fine-meta-up-to-1b-or-more-for-breaching-digital-markets-act-sources/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/new-york-post-meta-eu-dma-fine" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41744</id><published> 2025-03-25T19:53:39Z</published><updated> 2025-03-25T19:53:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

So when Twitter refugees show up, it doesn&#39;t feel familiar. Because it&#39;s not supposed to. [...] Hundreds of millions of people liked what Twitter once was, and what it aspired to be. Bluesky might be that.</p></blockquote><p> As recently as last September, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/brazil-x-bluesky">that prediction wasn&#39;t looking so good</a> . But Bluesky finally got some traction around (and especially after) the election, and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bluesky+has+the+juice">juice</a> it picked up wasn&#39;t fleeting.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a diss on Mastodon. If I could only use one of these platforms, Mastodon would be it. By far the highest signal-to-noise ratio amongst my timelines, and by far the best engagement with my readers and listeners. It&#39;s a nerdy platform for nerdy users, but with its commitment to true openness, including APIs, it&#39;s also the platform with by far the best <em>and most varied</em> client apps.</p><p> In the old world, there was one Twitter-like network that mattered: Twitter itself. In the new world, there exists a diaspora of refugees across these Twitter-like platforms, which have each carved out their own vibes. There are pros and cons to the old world and new. I found it much easier, mentally, to have just one place to check, and that place was available through <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">truly excellent native apps</a> for both Mac and iOS. Now that my attention is spread across multiple such networks — (in order of attention) Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, and, last and definitely least, but still there, X — I feel more scattered mentally, but I&#39;m also pretty sure I spend less time overall using all of them combined today than I did for Twitter&#39;s peak decade-or-so, and that I&#39;m better off for that.</p><p> It helps, too, that the first-party apps for Bluesky and Threads are mediocre on iOS (and Threads, oddly, is quite slow everywhere) and can only be used via the web on the Mac — they don&#39;t even have bad Mac client apps, they have <em>no</em> Mac client apps. <em>Helps</em> that is, insofar as I therefore spend less time using them. I&#39;m greatly looking forward to Tapbots&#39;s upcoming Bluesky client, <a href="https://tapbots.com/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> , but in the back of my mind I&#39;m vaguely worried that Phoenix might ultimately make me less productive because the additional joy and efficiency it will add to my Bluesky experience will lead me to spend more time there than I should. A good problem to have.</p><p> What I didn&#39;t see coming in May 2023 was Meta&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/threads">successful launch of Threads that summer</a> . The core problem with Threads is that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a true vision behind it, other than serving to fuck with Elon Musk and X. It&#39;s always been kind of interesting and kind of fun, and has never been toxic. (Meta&#39;s much-ballyhooed “ <em>there&#39;s a new sheriff in town and we aim to please him</em> ” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag">content-moderation policy changes in January</a> have seemingly had no effect whatsoever on the tenor or activity on Threads.) But it&#39;s never been <em>really</em> interesting or <em>really</em> fun. It&#39;s a platform without a soul. It aspires to be anodyne, which is very different than empowering users not to feel like they&#39;ve got to dodge a never-ending barrage of turds being thrown by the angry chaos monkeys who&#39;ve overrun X. If Threads does have a vibe, that vibe is blandness.</p><p> But so while Threads bursting onto the scene in summer 2023 maybe delayed Bluesky&#39;s blossoming, I suspect Threads might have ultimately <em>helped</em> Bluesky by opening the minds of many Twitter refugees into just <em>trying</em> some new alternatives. One size doesn&#39;t fit all. Nor one social network.</p><p> The bottom line is that I think my May 2023 prediction is proving out. Bluesky is what Twitter of yore aspired to be. Users are in control of what they see in their timelines. Sub-communities are vibrant. Shitbirds get blocked and added to blocklists, not elevated to the top of reply threads because they paid for a blue-check power-up. The centralized nature of the Bluesky platform gives the hardcore federation zealots the heebie-jeebies, but that&#39;s what makes Bluesky understandable and approachable, and I think clearly more performant than Mastodon can ever hope to be. It&#39;s a really cool concept for a Twitter-like platform that, after a slow build-up, has turned into an actual really cool platform, whose focus, first and foremost, is putting users first.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ It Might Be Time for Me to Collect Some Being Right Points for My 2023 Bluesky Prediction</title></entry><entry><title> Threads Is Losing to Bluesky </title><link href="https://birchtree.me/blog/meta-has-squandered-threads/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/threads-is-losing-to-bluesky" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41740</id><published> 2025-03-25T15:04:34Z</published><updated> 2025-03-25T22:04:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Bryan Irace:</p><blockquote><p> Barring a sharp correction, Apple looks increasingly likely to miss out on a generation of developers conditioned to first reach for tools like <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a> , <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> , or <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a> — especially as Apple&#39;s own AI tooling <a href="https://dimillian.medium.com/where-is-swift-assist-6ea348767cf3">remains notably absent</a> . This goes well beyond enabling new entrants to “ <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">vibe code</a> ” — experienced mobile developers who, despite history with Xcode and a predilection for building native apps, are begrudgingly swapping out their tools in acknowledgement of the inarguable productivity benefits. [...]</p><p> App Review has always long been a major source of developer frustration. Authoritarian yet inconsistent policy enforcement aside, it&#39;s simply too hard to distribute software <em>even to your own Apple devices</em> , let alone someone else&#39;s. This isn&#39;t new by any means, but as the time to build an app shrinks from weeks/months to hours/days, it feels more egregious — and thus like more of a liability — than ever before.</p></blockquote><p> This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking piece. I feel like Irace is onto something here that I haven&#39;t seen anyone put their finger on before.</p><p> The App Store, when it debuted, made developers deliriously happy. The UIKit frameworks (aka CocoaTouch), Objective-C, and Xcode were all way better ways to create apps for mobile devices than anything else at the time. And for distribution, going through Apple and the App Store was way easier and way more democratic, and 70/30 was way more generous to developers, than anything from the various phone carriers around the world. You&#39;d be lucky to get a 30/70 split from the carriers, and they&#39;d only deal with large corporate developers. There were no indie or hobbyist mobile app developers before the App Store. (It&#39;s kind of nutty in hindsight that network carriers were the only distribution channel for apps 17 years ago.)</p><p> 17 years is a long time, though. And developers long ago stopped seeing the App Store as something that makes them happy, or that <em>reduces</em> friction and hassle from their lives. Instead they view it as a major source of friction and hassle. Apple should have focused on keeping the App Store as a thing that makes developers (mostly) happy all along, not (as things stand today) mostly miserable.</p><p> Basically, the threat to Apple that the App Store poses is <em>not</em> regulators coming for it. That&#39;s a distraction. The threat, as I&#39;ve <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">long tried to argue</a> , perhaps unsuccessfully, is that market forces will work against it eventually. Developers have long since grown resentful toward the technical and bureaucratic hassles of publishing through the App Store, and the size of the purchase commissions Apple keeps for itself. Apple&#39;s commission percentages haven&#39;t grown over time, but a 70/30 split that in 2008 seemed remarkably generous (or even the newer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">85/15 small-business split</a> ) today seems like a platform engaging in usury and abusive rent-seeking.</p><p> AI might be the disruption that brings about the “eventually”, because now it&#39;s coming for the developer tooling experience too. If Apple&#39;s native programming frameworks and developer tools aren&#39;t the best, most satisfying, most productive ways to create great apps, what&#39;s left that makes developers happy to be creating for the iOS platform?</p><p> Apple should move mountains to refocus itself on making the experience of developing for (and on) Apple platforms the best in the world, including distribution and monetization. Instead, they seem to be resting on the assumption that it&#39;s a privilege, self-evident to all, just to be allowed to develop for Apple platforms.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Tim, Don’t Kill My Vibe’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/irace-vibe-killing">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://lex.games/df" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7e" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/lexgames_free_daily_word_games" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41738</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-03-24T22:14:49Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T20:05:43Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>I read Timothy Snyder&#39;s <em>On Tyranny</em> after the election. A collection of 20 essays — each relatively brief, some exceptionally brief — it&#39;s more booklet than book, and can easily be consumed in an afternoon or a few evenings. I finished it with an unsettled feeling. I read it again last week, and my feeling now is both more unsettled and more resolute.</p><p> Snyder, a plain-speaking history professor at Yale, has a core message, <a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/obeying-in-advance">which he&#39;s been hammering</a> since <em>before</em> Trump&#39;s re-election: <em>Do not obey in advance.抵抗。</em> The following passage hit me harder on this second reading, two months into Trump 2.0, than it did in November. From Chapter 19: “Be a Patriot”:</p><blockquote><p> It is not patriotic to admire foreign dictators. It is not patriotic to cultivate a relationship with Kim Jong Un; or to say that Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin are superior leaders. It is not patriotic to call upon foreign leaders to intervene in American presidential elections. It is not patriotic to cite Russian propaganda at rallies. It is not patriotic to share an adviser with Russian oligarchs. It is not patriotic to appoint advisers with financial interests in Russian companies. It is not patriotic to appoint a National Security Advisor who likes to be called “General Misha,” nor to pardon him for his crimes. It is not patriotic when that pardoned official calls for martial law. It is not patriotic to refer to American soldiers as “losers” and “suckers.” It is not patriotic to take health care from families, nor to golf your way through a national epidemic in which half a million Americans die. It is not patriotic to try to sabotage an American election, nor to claim victory after defeat. It is not patriotic to try to end democracy.</p><p> A nationalist might do all these things, but a nationalist is not a patriot. A nationalist encourages us to be our worst, and then tells us that we are the best. A nationalist, “although endlessly brooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge,” wrote Orwell, tends to be “uninterested in what happens in the real world.” Nationalism is relativist, since the only truth is the resentment we feel when we contemplate others. As the novelist Danilo Kiš put it, nationalism “has no universal values, aesthetic or ethical.”</p><p> A patriot, by contrast, wants the nation to live up to its ideals, which means asking us to be our best selves. A patriot must be concerned with the real world, which is the only place where his country can be loved and sustained. A patriot has universal values, standards by which he judges his nation, always wishing it well — and wishing that it would do better.</p><p> Democracy failed in Europe in the 1920s, &#39;30s, and &#39;40s, and it is failing not only in much of Europe but in many parts of the world today. It is that history and experience that reveals to us the dark range of our possible futures. A nationalist will say that “it can&#39;t happen here,” which is the first step toward disaster. A patriot says that it could happen here, but that we will stop it.</p></blockquote><p> I highly recommend the book.

<p>Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic ( <a href="https://apple.news/Ay8ft1edESzS5rQlnHX1rFQ">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The world found out shortly before 2 pm eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.</p><p> I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 am The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.</p><p> This is going to require some explaining. [...]</p></blockquote><p> The notion of a journalist being accidentally included in a war-planning group of national security leaders — and the very notion that US national security leaders would use Signal to conduct such a group — is so preposterous that Goldberg had assumed the group was a hoax, with the intention of embarrassing him. But it was real.</p><blockquote><p> Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ll add: Do they sniff glue and eat paste?</p><p> There&#39;s so much chaos at the moment resulting from the Trump administration&#39;s actions during these first two months that it&#39;s easy to overlook one salient fact: Trump has chosen to surround himself with idiots.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Trump Administration Accidentally Included Jeffrey Goldberg, Editor of The Atlantic, in a Signal Group Chat That Revealed War Plans for Yemen’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/trump-admin-included-goldberg-in-yemen-war-plan-signal-group">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Podcasting Technology Cadence&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/03/23/ep-419" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w79" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/23/the-talk-show-419" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41733</id><published> 2025-03-23T17:24:10Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T21:59:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>How has your week been? My week was ... <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">busy</a> . That includes a new episode of The Talk Show recorded yesterday, dropping in your favorite podcast app soon. Amidst all the writing (and talking) I&#39;ve been doing, I&#39;m also working on filling up open weeks on the sponsorship schedule for Q2.</p><p> After a very full February and March, I&#39;ve got a bunch of openings in the next few months — and openings for <s>the next two weeks, starting with this Monday</s> . <strong>Update:</strong> The coming week just sold, but the next week, starting March 31, remains open.</p><p> Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">back in 2007</a> . They&#39;ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There&#39;s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors&#39; perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p><p> If you&#39;ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF&#39;s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, <a href="mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship">get in touch</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Weekly Sponsorships Here at Daring Fireball’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/weekly-sponsorship-here-at-daring-fireball">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WorkOS: Launch Week </title><link href="https://workos.com/launch-week/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w77" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/workos-launch-week" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41731</id><published> 2025-03-21T22:38:04Z</published><updated> 2025-03-22T16:30:21Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Ookla, the company behind the Speedtest download/upload bandwidth testing app:</p><blockquote><p> Although it&#39;s early in the adoption curve for the iPhone 16e, we analyzed the performance of the new device from March 1st through March 12th, and compared it to the performance of iPhone 16, which has a similar design and the same 6.1” screen. Both devices run on the same Apple-designed A18 SoC.</p><p> When we compare Speedtest Intelligence data from the top 90th percentile (those with the highest performance experience) of iPhone 16e and iPhone 16 users from all three of the top US operators, we see the iPhone 16 performing better in download speeds. However, at the opposite end, with the 10th percentile of users (those who experience the lowest performance) we see the iPhone 16e performing better than the iPhone 16.</p></blockquote><p> There are some differences, but overall the 16e&#39;s cellular performance seems great for the frequencies it supports. And given the efficiency claims from Apple, it might be the better overall modem. (I also think the frequencies it <em>doesn&#39;t</em> support don&#39;t really matter all that much in real-world practice. If you know that you really make use of the crazy-high speeds of mmWave from Verizon, then you know the C1 modem is not for you.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ookla: ‘A First Look at How Apple’s C1 Modem Performs With Early Adopters’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/ookla-16e-c1-modem-results">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/keyboard_maestro_hack_of_the_week_dont_paste_images" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w74" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41728</id><published> 2025-03-21T19:37:49Z</published><updated> 2025-03-22T16:31:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> I keep meaning to write more about Keyboard Maestro, and so I&#39;m just going to start documenting all the little use cases I find for it.

<p>My number one tip for becoming a Mac power user is to get into <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> . Using Keyboard Maestro feels like gaining superpowers. I keep meaning to write more about Keyboard Maestro, and so I&#39;m just going to start documenting all the little use cases I find for it. Here&#39;s one from today.</p><p> I use <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> to publish at least 99 percent of the posts on this site. (The other 1 percent are posts I create on my phone, using the web interface for Movable Type.) I use MarsEdit <em>a lot</em> . About once a week or so, I accidentally try to paste text in MarsEdit when I think I have text on my clipboard, but it&#39;s actually an image. When you paste an image in MarsEdit, it&#39;s not like pasting into Mail or Notes or TextEdit, where the image just goes into the text. So MarsEdit, trying to be helpful, opens its <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/marsedit-upload-utility.png">Upload Utility window</a> — which, if I were using WordPress or some other CMS, might allow me to upload the image to my server for referencing from the HTML of the blog post. That&#39;s not how my system works, and not how I want it to work, so every time this happens I have to close the Upload Utility window. And every time, I try to do this by hitting the Esc key on my keyboard. But the Upload Utility window isn&#39;t a dialog box with a Cancel button that would be triggered by Esc. It&#39;s a regular window. So after hitting the Esc key, which doesn&#39;t do anything in this context, I then remember, once again, that I need to hit ⌘W instead. (I think I don&#39;t naturally think to hit ⌘W because my instincts tell me ⌘W would try to close the blog window I&#39;m writing in.)</p><p> Today it happened again, and finally the notion occurred to me that I could fix this with Keyboard Maestro. My first thought was that I could create a macro that <em>would</em> close the frontmost window in MarsEdit if, and only if, the frontmost window was named “Upload Utility”. A second later it occurred to me that I could probably do better than that, and prevent the Upload Utility window from opening in the first place if I ever try to paste an image in MarsEdit.</p><p>我是对的。 This wasn&#39;t just super easy to create in Keyboard Maestro, it was super quick. I&#39;ve spent 10× more time writing about this macro here than I did creating it. I think that&#39;s why I so seldom write about my little hacks in Keyboard Maestro — they not only save me time and eliminate annoyances once they&#39;re created, but they&#39;re so easy to create that I just get back to whatever I was previously doing after making a new one.</p><p> First, I have a group (think: folders) in Keyboard Maestro for every app for which I&#39;ve created app-specific macros. You just create a new group and set it to only be available when one (or more) specific applications are active. Inside my group for MarsEdit, I created a new macro named “Don&#39;t Paste Images”.</p><p> It&#39;s triggered by the hot key sequence ⌘V. That means every single time I paste in MarsEdit, this macro will run. Keyboard Maestro is so frigging fast that I&#39;ll never notice. (Keyboard Maestro macros execute so fast that in some scenarios, you have to add steps to pause for, say, 0.2 seconds to keep the macro from getting ahead of the user interface it&#39;s manipulating.)</p><p> The macro executes a simple <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/If_Then_Else">if-then-else action</a> with the following pseudocode logic:</p><pre> <code>if the System Clipboard has an image play a sound else simulate the keystroke ⌘V</code></pre><p> That&#39;s the whole thing. And it worked perfectly the first time I tried it. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/km-dont-paste-images-marsedit.png">Here&#39;s a screenshot of my macro</a> .</p><p> So if <em>I</em> type ⌘V in MarsEdit, and the clipboard contains an image, I just hear a beep. (I could just default to the system beep, but I chose the standard MacOS “Bottle” sound just for this macro — I sort of want to know that it&#39;s <em>this</em> macro keeping me from pasting whatever text I wrongly thought was on my clipboard, so I want a distinctive sound to play.) Nothing gets pasted, so MarsEdit&#39;s Upload Utility window doesn&#39;t appear.</p><p> If the clipboard <em>doesn&#39;t</em> contain an image, then Keyboard Maestro simulates a ⌘V shortcut and that gets passed to MarsEdit, and from my perspective as a user, it&#39;s just like a normal paste of the text I expected. I have a few macros that work like this, where the macro is trigged by an application&#39;s own keyboard shortcut, and the macro will (if certain conditions are met) pass through the same simulated keyboard shortcut to the application. When I first tried this, many years ago, I was half worried that it would trigger an infinite loop, where the simulated keystroke from the Keyboard Maestro macro would re-trigger the macro. I was wrong to worry — Keyboard Maestro is too clever for that.</p><p> You almost certainly don&#39;t have my particular problem with the occasional inadvertent pasting of images into MarsEdit. But I bet you have your own esoteric annoyances related to your own most-used apps and most-frequent tasks. Keyboard Maestro lets you effectively add your own little features to your favorite apps — often with no “scripting” at all. The best part is, while writing this very blog post, my new “Don&#39;t Paste Images” macro saved me from seeing that cursed Upload Utility window once more, because I had the screenshot of the macro on my clipboard, when I thought I had copied the URL for it on my server.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Keyboard Maestro Hack of the Week: Don&#39;t Paste Images</title></entry><entry><title> Yahoo Sold TechCrunch </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633950/yahoo-selling-techcrunch-regent-acquisition" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w75" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/yahoo-sold-techcrunch" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41729</id><published> 2025-03-21T19:00:00Z</published><updated> 2025-03-21T22:05:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Matthew Belloni has a very good take on Apple TV+ at Puck (that&#39;s a gift link that should get you through their paywall — but which requires you creating a free account, sorry):</p><blockquote><p> All of which fed into the self-centered fears of my lunch date. What, if anything, does the current state of Apple mean for its entertainment business? After all, more than five years into the Apple TV+ experiment, it&#39;s never been entirely clear what CEO Tim Cook and services chief Eddy Cue are up to in Hollywood. Certainly not making money, at least not in the traditional sense. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year?rc=1m8jsa">reported</a> today that Apple lost $1 billion on Apple TV+ last year, following a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-21/apple-tries-to-rein-in-hollywood-spending-after-years-of-losses">report</a> that more than $20 billion has been shoveled into making original shows and movies since 2019. That&#39;s not nothing, even for a company worth $3 trillion.</p><p> The “loss” number is a bit misleading, of course, considering Apple has always said that a key goal is to leverage Leo DiCaprio and Reese Witherspoon to thicken its brand halo and the device “ecosystem,” ultimately boosting its other businesses. But still… for all its billions, Apple TV+ has accumulated only about 45 million subscribers worldwide, according to today&#39;s Information report and other estimates.</p><p> That&#39;s far less than Disney+, Max, and Paramount+, all of which launched around the same time. Those rival services are attached to legacy studios with rich libraries, but they&#39;re not attached to a company with $65 billion in cash on hand and a device in the pockets of 1 billion people that also delivers bundle-friendly music, news, and games. Apple declined to confirm or comment on any numbers, but a source there suggested the subscriber number is higher than 45 million and that the global nature of the sub base is being undercounted by US-oriented research firms.或许。 The company reveals zero performance data beyond BS “biggest weekend ever!” press releases that the trades accept without skepticism and producers like Ben Stiller and David Ellison post with “blessed” emojis on their social media. No one outside the company really knows how the Apple TV+ business is performing.</p></blockquote><p> One interesting nugget is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/puck-apple-tv+-signups.png">this chart</a> , which suggests that subscriptions to TV+ have boomed since Apple and Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/apple-tv-shows-amazon-prime-video-subscription">worked out a deal to sell TV+ subscriptions</a> through Amazon Channels in Prime Video at the end of last year. That deal has, seemingly, moved the needle. Another interesting nugget is that TV+ seems to suffer from a higher churn rate than other streaming services. Said Belloni&#39;s Puck colleague Julia Alexander, “Fewer than 35 percent of all subscribers keep the service for longer than six months.”</p><p> That&#39;s kind of crazy. I&#39;d think TV+ would have <em>less</em> churn, not more, than the industry average — that the Apple TV+ audience is small but loyal. Perhaps this is the unsurprising side effect of Apple giving away 3-month trials when you purchase new devices. But I also truly wonder if TV+ subscriptions are the hardest for industry groups to measure, because so many people who do subscribe watch through tvOS (or, on their phones, on iOS) where everything is private. Belloni hints at this, and says little birdies at Apple told him the TV+ subscriber base is larger than they&#39;re getting credit for.</p><p> And how do you count <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One</a> subscribers toward TV+&#39;s subscriber base? My vague theory about Cue and Cook&#39;s thinking about getting into this business has been about making it one leg among several on the stool of reasons to subscribe to Apple One. That Apple will take subscribers who are <em>only</em> subscribed to TV+, or only subscribed to TV+ and Apple Music, but what they really want is to get people to subscribe to Apple One, which, because it includes iCloud storage, almost certainly has very little churn.</p><p> Belloni closes thus:</p><blockquote><p> Apple wouldn&#39;t be the first tech powerhouse to dabble in professionally produced content only to retreat. [...] Neither Cook nor Cue has suggested anything like that, and Apple, in just over five years, has become a reliable partner and a high-quality buyer for Hollywood shows and movies. In some ways, it&#39;s remarkable how fast Apple TV+ became part of the entertainment community. Whether that lasts is the question.</p></blockquote><p> Here&#39;s where I will point out that Apple isn&#39;t like other tech companies. Apple isn&#39;t a <em>move fast and break things</em> company. They&#39;re a <em>measure twice, cut once</em> company. When they commit to something, they tend to stay committed. And they&#39;re very, very good at playing long games that require patience, especially when entering new markets. Look at Apple Pay. 10 years ago, it was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pay-showing-signs-could-214558347.html">widely panned</a> as <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-pay-was-a-massive-flop-on-black-friday">a flop</a> after a slow first year. Now it&#39;s everywhere.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Matthew Belloni on the ‘Apple TV+ Experiment’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/belloni-apple-tv">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Is Apple&#39;s Spending on TV+ Content a &#39;Loss&#39; or a &#39;Cost&#39;? </title><link href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/apple-appletv-annual-streaming-losses-1236345490/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w72" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41726</id><published> 2025-03-21T16:18:07Z</published><updated> 2025-03-21T18:28:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jill Goldsmith, Deadline:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is losing more than $1 billion a year on streamer Apple TV+, according to a report in the Information that cited two people familiar with the matter. The tech giant has spent over $5 billion a year on content since launching Apple TV+ in 2019 but trimmed that by about $500 million last year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year">the report said</a> .</p></blockquote><p> The headline on Wayne Ma&#39;s report at The Information set the framework: “ <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year">Apple Streaming Losses Top $1 Billion a Year</a> ” — the story got picked up widely, and almost everyone who did framed it in terms of <em>losing</em> or a <em>loss</em> . But is it a <em>loss</em> when Apple expected the business to be unprofitable for a decade or more? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-tv-reportedly-loses-1-billion-a-year-and-thats-okay-for-now/">From Scharon Harding&#39;s paraphrasing at Ars Technica</a> of Ma&#39;s paywalled report:</p><blockquote><p> Apple TV+ being Apple&#39;s only service not turning a profit isn&#39;t <em>good</em> , but it&#39;s also expected. Like other streaming services, Apple TV+ wasn&#39;t expected to be profitable until years after its launch. An Apple TV+ employee that The Information said reviewed the streaming service&#39;s business plan said Apple TV+ is expected to lose $15 billion to $20 billion during its first 10 years.</p><p> For comparison, Disney&#39;s direct-to-consumer streaming business had operating losses <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2025/02/08/disneys-streaming-unit-loses-three-times-more-money-than-disneyland-paris/">of $11.4 billion</a> between the launch of Disney+ in fall 2020 and April 2024. Disney&#39;s streaming business became profitable for the first time in its fiscal quarter ending on June 29, 2024.</p></blockquote><p> The above two paragraphs of essential context are buried 13 paragraphs down. If Apple expected TV+ to operate in the red, to the tune of $15–20 billion over its first decade, and halfway through that decade ( <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">TV+ debuted</a> in November 2019) it operated in the red to the tune of $1 billion for the year — doesn&#39;t that mean costs are exactly in line with their expectations?</p><p> The insinuation here is that Apple&#39;s pissing this money away and doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. Maybe they are! But if so it was exactly Eddy Cue and Tim Cook&#39;s strategy to piss this money away. If Apple had expected TV+ to be profitable or break-even in 2024, then a $1 billion operating loss would be a story. But as it stands it&#39;s just a cost.

<p>Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors last week:</p><blockquote><p> With new iOS software updates, Apple has been automatically turning Apple Intelligence on again even for users who have disabled it, a decision that has become increasingly frustrating for those that don&#39;t want to use Apple Intelligence .</p><p> After installing iOS 18.3.2, iPhone users have noticed that Apple Intelligence is <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2-with-bug-fixes.2452817/post-33793315">automatically turned on</a> , regardless of whether it was turned off prior to the update being installed. There is an Apple Intelligence splash screen that comes up after updating, and there is no option other than tapping “Continue,” which turns on Apple Intelligence .</p><p> If you&#39;ve updated to iOS 18.3.2 and do not want Apple Intelligence enabled, you will need to go the Settings app, tap on Apple Intelligence, and then toggle it off. When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/">consumes up to 7GB</a> of storage space for local AI models, which is an inconvenience when storage space is limited.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d been seeing complaints about this, including from some friends who are developers and/or had previously worked on iOS as engineers at Apple. A bunch of regular DF readers have written to complain about it too. I wouldn&#39;t call it a deluge, but I&#39;ve gotten an unusual number of complaints about this. (And at CNet, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/did-apple-intelligence-turn-on-again-after-the-last-ios-18-update-how-to-turn-it-off/">Jeff Carlson reports the same thing happening with MacOS 15.3.2</a> .)</p><p> I hadn&#39;t experienced it personally because I have Apple Intelligence enabled on my iPhone. But my year-old iPhone 15 Pro was still running iOS 18.2. So I disabled Apple Intelligence on that phone, then updated it to 18.3.2. When it finished, Apple Intelligence was re-enabled. I also tried this on my iPhone 16e review unit, which was still running iOS 18.3.1 (albeit a version of 18.3.1 with a unique build number for the 16e). I turned Apple Intelligence off, upgraded to 18.3.2, and on that iPhone, Apple Intelligence remained off after the software upgrade completed.</p><p> So I don&#39;t know if this is a bug that only affects some iPhones, or a deliberate growth hacking decision from Apple to keep turning this back on for people who have explicitly turned it off. But it&#39;s definitely happening.</p><p> And while the 7 GB of storage space required for the model is a legitimate technical reason to turn it off, I think (judging from my email from DF readers) the main reason people disable Apple Intelligence is that they don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t trust it, and to some degree object to it. It could take up no additional storage space at all and they&#39;d still want it disabled on their devices, and they are fucking angry that Apple&#39;s own software updates keep turning it back on. Put aside the quality or utility of Apple Intelligence as it stands today, and there are people who object to the whole thing on principle or, I don&#39;t know, just vibes alone. Feelings are strong about this. Turning it back on <em>automatically</em> , after a user had turned it off <em>manually</em> , leads those users to correctly <em>distrust</em> Apple Intelligence specifically and Apple in general.</p><p> If it&#39;s a bug, it&#39;s a bug that makes Apple look like a bunch of gross shysters. If it&#39;s not a bug, it means Apple is a bunch of gross shysters. I&#39;d wager on bug — especially after seeing it not happen on my 16e review unit. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s something where it&#39;s supposed to be enabled by default, once, for people who&#39;ve never explicitly turned Apple Intelligence on or off previously, but that for some devices where it <em>has</em> been turned off explicitly, somehow the software update is mistaking it for the setting never having been touched. Apple needs to get it together on this one.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iOS 18 Software Updates Keep Re-Enabling Apple Intelligence for Users Who Had Turned It Off’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/ios-18-updates-reenable-apple-intelligence">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Sued for False Advertising Over Apple Intelligence </title><link href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/20/apple-suit-false-advertising-ai-intelligence" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w70" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-sued-for-false-advertising-over-apple-intelligence" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41724</id><published> 2025-03-21T14:29:25Z</published><updated> 2025-03-21T14:42:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, with a blockbuster scoop for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. is undergoing a rare shake-up of its executive ranks, aiming to get its artificial intelligence efforts back on track after months of delays and stumbles, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p> Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development, so he&#39;s moving over another top executive to help: Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. In a new role, Rockwell will be in charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the moves haven&#39;t been announced.</p><p> Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing Siri completely from Giannandrea&#39;s command. Apple is poised to announce the changes to employees this week. The iPhone maker&#39;s senior leaders — a group known as the Top 100 — just met at a secretive, annual offsite gathering to discuss the future of the company. Its AI efforts were a key talking point at the summit, Bloomberg News has reported. [...]</p></blockquote><p> My quick take on this is that it&#39;s a turf battle that Craig Federighi just won. It&#39;s not just putting a new executive in charge of Siri, it&#39;s moving Siri under Federighi&#39;s group.</p><p> How Gurman got this scoop before Apple had announced the changes — even internally — is rather unbelievable. It&#39;s not “Bloomberg” that got this scoop. It&#39;s Mark Gurman. And trust me, Apple PR did not leak this to him deliberately. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re now accelerating an announcement, at least internally, framing it on their own terms. I can only guess that Gurman hinted at his sourcing in the passage above: Tim Cook must have announced these changes at the Top 100 retreat this week, and at least two of those attendees leaked the news to Gurman.空前的。</p><p>还：</p><blockquote><p> Rockwell is currently the vice president in charge of the Vision Products Group, or VPG, the division that developed Apple&#39;s headset. As part of the changes, he&#39;ll be leaving that team and handing the reins to Paul Meade, an executive who has run hardware engineering for the Vision Pro under Rockwell.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find it surprising at all that Rockwell was given this task.</p><blockquote><p> Giannandrea will remain at the company, even with Rockwell taking over Siri. An abrupt departure would signal publicly that the AI efforts have been tumultuous — something Apple is reluctant to acknowledge. Giannandrea&#39;s other responsibilities include oversight of research, testing and technologies related to AI. The company also has a team reporting to Giannandrea investigating robotics.</p></blockquote><p> This I find a little surprising. But maybe I shouldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t buy Gurman&#39;s argument that dismissing Giannandrea would “signal publicly that the AI efforts have been tumultuous”. Apple <em>already</em> signaled that publicly <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">when they announced</a> that all of the ambitious features for Siri and Apple Intelligence that were promised for <em>this</em> year&#39;s OS cycle would be postponed until <em>next</em> year&#39;s OS cycle. That&#39;s public tumult. But I mean, you can see for yourself that Apple&#39;s AI efforts have been “tumultuous” by asking Siri on your iPhone, right now, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it">what month it is</a> .</p><p> What Apple needs to signal is that they don&#39;t expect to deliver a significantly better Siri without making significant changes to the team behind Siri.</p><p> But maybe the answer is as simple as that Giannandrea is good at leading and managing teams doing advanced research that is abstracted from product. So move the products out of his division and into Federighi&#39;s, and put someone who knows how to ship directly in charge of Siri. Leave Giannandrea in charge of a division focused on research and technology. Attention has moved on from “machine learning” to LLMs, but Apple&#39;s machine learning game has gotten very good.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gurman: Tim Cook Has Put Mike Rockwell in Charge of Siri, Reporting to Craig Federighi’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/gurman-rockwell-siri">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> HealthKit as a Model for an Open Semantic Index From Apple </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/apple-needs-to-get-out-of-the-way-with-ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/healthkit-as-a-model-for-an-open-semantic-index-from-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41721</id><published> 2025-03-20T14:08:11Z</published><updated> 2025-03-20T22:48:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#39;s an update I just appended to my post yesterday, after linking to<a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/3/how_apple_could_help_developers_with_ai_and_llms.html">Gus Mueller&#39;s suggestion</a> that Apple open up a semantic index to third-party AI apps:</p><blockquote><p> HealthKit already works a lot like what Mueller is suggesting here (for, say, “SemanticKit”). With explicit user permission — that can be revoked at any time — third party apps can both read from and write to your Health data. Apple does a lot of that itself, both through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related things an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are welcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p></blockquote><p> Nobody is suggesting Apple should give up on AI.相反。 They really need to go from being <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it">a joke</a> to being good at it, fast. But there&#39;s no reason at all they should build out a strategy that relies on Apple doing all of it themselves, and Apple users relying solely on Apple&#39;s own AI. Do it like Health — a model that has proven to be:</p><ul><li> profitable (for Apple itself, selling devices like Watches);</li><li> popular (with users, who actually use it, understand it, and like it);</li><li>私人的;</li><li> and open to third-party developers, device makers, and medical service providers.</li></ul><p> ( <a href="https://mastodon.social/@williamw/114191747428238280">Thanks to Bill Welense</a> for the suggestion.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘HealthKit as a Model for an Open Semantic Index From Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/healthkit-as-a-model-for-an-open-semantic-index-from-apple">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The M1 MacBook Air Lives on at Walmart, Now Just $650 </title><link href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/715596133" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/walmart-macbook-air" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41720</id><published> 2025-03-20T13:53:04Z</published><updated> 2025-03-20T22:47:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last March, when Apple introduced the then new M3 MacBook Airs, they moved the base model 13-inch M2 MacBook Air into the magic $999 spot in their own lineup, replacing the M1 MacBook Air. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/macbook-air-walmart">But mid-March it was announced that Walmart would begin selling the M1 MacBook Air</a> — in one tech-spec configuration (8 GB RAM, 256 SSD), but three colors (gold, silver, space gray) for just $700.</p><p> This year <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/apple-announces-with-little-surprise-m4-macbook-airs">Apple replaced the entire lineup of MacBook Airs that it sells itself with M4-based models</a> , including the $999 starting-price model. Online, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=macbook">Walmart sells a handful of MacBook models now</a> , at, per Walmart&#39;s brand, slightly lower prices than Apple itself. But the one and only MacBook they seem to stock in their retail stores is the classic wedge-shaped M1 MacBook Air — now down to $650.</p><p> It&#39;s over four years old now, and yes, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB of storage are meager, but it&#39;s almost certainly the best new laptop you can buy for that price. Assuming Apple thinks this partnership is a success, eventually they&#39;ll have to replace this with a more recent MacBook Air. But I suspect the main reason it&#39;s still the M1 Air (and hasn&#39;t been replaced by, say, the M2 Air) is not about the specs or performance, per se, but rather simply how it looks. It looks like an older MacBook. Walmart might not get an updated MacBook with a more-recent-than-M1 chip until Apple refreshes the industrial design on its current MacBook Airs.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The M1 MacBook Air Lives on at Walmart, Now Just $650’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/walmart-macbook-air">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Hey Siri, What Month Is It?&#39; </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jehkpm/apple_intelligence_this_apple_intelligence_that/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41719</id><published> 2025-03-19T23:49:43Z</published><updated> 2025-03-20T13:30:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>News from Apple that I let slip by a few weeks ago, but that seems apt again <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements">today</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence, will soon be available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India.</p><p> These new languages will be accessible in nearly all regions around the world with the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April, and developers can start to test these releases today.</p><p> With the upcoming software updates, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will have access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time, and Apple Intelligence will expand to a new platform in US English with Apple Vision Pro — helping users communicate, collaborate, and express themselves in entirely new ways.</p></blockquote><p> Given that Apple Intelligence <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">isn&#39;t exactly setting the world on fire</a> , I think in the grand scheme of things, it&#39;ll wind up being filed away under “ <em>Oh yeah, remember that?</em> ” that the EU got it 4-5 months after it debuted. (Clean Up in Photos is often great, and I genuinely enjoy notification summaries and miss them now that they&#39;re disabled for news apps; the rest I don&#39;t use, and the most ambitious aspects of Apple Intelligence are ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">you may have heard</a> ) <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">delayed for everyone</a> , not just the EU.)</p><p> Apple was concerned that the EU&#39;s hardline interpretation of the DMA was such that the European Commission considered it a violation of the DMA that Apple Intelligence wasn&#39;t an interchangeable component. Like the way the EC forced Apple to open up iOS to alternative app marketplaces — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/eu_reaping_what_it_sows">there was uncertainty</a> whether they&#39;d demand the same for system-integrated AI. And if that&#39;s what the EC had demanded, they simply wouldn&#39;t have gotten system-integrated AI for years. But I&#39;m not sure how to square up <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements">today&#39;s decisions</a> — requiring Apple to enable third-party alternatives to system-level features like AirPlay and AirDrop — with an interpretation that the EU will be fine with Apple Intelligence only offering Apple&#39;s own AI (along with Apple&#39;s approved partners, like OpenAI).</p><p> I think the regime change at the European Commission has changed things to some degree, but quietly. Former competition chief Margrethe Vestager was a firebrand. Back in June last year, after Apple had announced that Apple Intelligence would be delayed indefinitely in the EU for iOS, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/28/withholding-apple-intelligence-from-eu/">she made clear that <em>she</em> thought it was anti-competitive</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “I find that very interesting that they say we will now deploy AI where we&#39;re not obliged to enable competition. I think that is that is the most sort of stunning open declaration that they know 100% that this is another way of disabling competition where they have a stronghold already.”</p></blockquote><p> But Vestager is gone, and until today we hadn&#39;t heard a whit about DMA compliance from her successor, Teresa Ribera. In September, when the proceedings that resulted in today&#39;s decisions opened, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/20/ec-apple-specification-proceedings">I wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Also worth noting: Margrethe Vestager is on her way out, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/teresa-ribera-brussels-ursula-von-der-leyen-europe/">about to be replaced</a> by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad2db1a7-69e8-4369-9cf1-cc4896df4cc7">Spanish socialist Teresa Ribera</a> , a career climate expert (which, possibly, might give her an affinity for Apple, far and away the most <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">climate-friendly</a> large tech company) with no experience in competition law. To me that makes Ribera an odd choice for the competition chief job, but apparently that makes sense in the EU.

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/14/all-hands-siri-team-meeting-leaks-to-bloomberg">My post Friday</a> commenting (read: <em>wise-cracking</em> ) on Mark Gurman&#39;s explosive report on an all-hands Siri team meeting at Apple was begging for a bit of meta commentary on the reporting itself. But I&#39;ve been doing so much of that regarding Gurman lately that I thought it best to hold it for a postscript. Here&#39;s that postscript.</p><p> Both of these things are true:</p><ul><li> Mark Gurman is a singular reporter in the Apple media sphere. He publishes an extraordinary number of exclusives, both regarding leaks of upcoming products, and leaks <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/apple-s-siri-chief-calls-ai-delays-ugly-and-embarrassing-promises-fixes">like this Siri team meeting</a> .</li><li> Gurman <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">often</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad">gets</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads">things</a> wrong, and when he does, he never acknowledges those mistakes, let alone corrects them. He also tries to take credit for having called things <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/your-source-for-scoops">he completely missed</a> . He&#39;s not an oracle but presents himself as one. And he writes for a publication, Bloomberg, that shares his insistence on never acknowledging let alone correcting mistakes, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con">even massive ones</a> . What gives me such joy pointing out his boners isn&#39;t that he made them in the first place but that he refuses to acknowledge they happened, presenting an air of infallibility with a provably fallible track record.</li></ul><p> In short, I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/member/2025/03/the-pinata-of-apple-rumors/">do actually suspect</a> — but can claim zero sources familiar with the matter to confirm — that Gurman hangs his toilet paper in an improper underhand fashion.</p><p> So let&#39;s just examine how extraordinary and singular Gurman&#39;s Friday report was. Nobody else reported on this meeting. <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250314/p18#a250314p18">Every other article about it</a> — including mine — was commenting on Gurman&#39;s exclusive report about the meeting. I&#39;ve not seen one other report even confirming the meeting took place, let alone describing it in detail, replete with copious quotes from Siri senior director Robby Walker, who, according to Gurman, led the meeting. Not one. I&#39;m not pointing that out to cast suspicion that the meeting did not take place or that Gurman&#39;s report cast it inaccurately or that his direct quotations were not, in fact, direct quotations. I&#39;m pointing out just how singular and extraordinary Mark Gurman is in this sphere. If it wasn&#39;t for Gurman&#39;s report we, outside Apple (and probably outside the Siri team inside Apple) wouldn&#39;t even know the meeting occurred.</p><p> How did Gurman not only get the scoop on this meeting, but copious direct quotes from Walker&#39;s remarks to the team? Well, it was “according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the gathering was private”. In other words, more than one member of the Siri team, and at least one of which either recorded the meeting surreptitiously and slipped the recording to Gurman, or at least one of whom takes notes at the pace and accuracy of a court stenographer. Either way, these sources — plural — surely knew how the meeting would make Apple look if it were to leak.</p><p> I&#39;ve long made my opinions about Bloomberg&#39;s institutional journalistic credibility well known. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;re bereft of credibility — it&#39;s the fact that they are deservedly well-regarded that makes their refusal to ever admit their own glaring mistakes so notable. When a Gurman reports says “people” that means “more than one” and, I believe, he must be able to confirm to his editors that he got this information from more than one source. If he&#39;s reporting direct quotes, I think that means he&#39;s heard a recording.这是非凡的。</p><p> But I&#39;d feel a lot better about our collective conventional wisdom regarding the nature of this particular all-hands Siri meeting if it had leaked to, and been reported on by, more than one reporter at more than one publication.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ A Postscript on the Singular Nature of Mark Gurman&#39;s Reporting </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5q" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41678</id><published> 2025-03-12T23:37:14Z</published><updated> 2025-03-22T16:32:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Who decided these personalized Siri features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they&#39;d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment?

<p>In the two decades I&#39;ve been in this racket, I&#39;ve never been angrier at myself for missing a story than I am about Apple&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">announcement on Friday</a> that the “more personalized Siri” features of Apple Intelligence, scheduled to appear between now and WWDC, would be delayed until “the coming year”.</p><p> I should have my head examined.</p><p> This announcement dropped as a surprise, and certainly took me by surprise to some extent, but it was all there from the start. I should have been pointing out red flags starting back at WWDC last year, and I am embarrassed and sorry that I didn&#39;t see what should have been very clear to me from the start.</p><p> How I missed this is twofold. First, I&#39;d been lulled into complacency by Apple&#39;s track record of consistently shipping pre-announced products and features. Their record in that regard wasn&#39;t perfect, but the exceptions tended to be around the edges. (Nobody was particularly clamoring for Apple to make a multi-device inductive charging mat, so it never generated too much controversy <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features#fn1-2025-03-07">when AirPower turned out to be a complete bust</a> .) Second, I was foolishly distracted by the “Apple Intelligence” brand umbrella. It&#39;s a fine idea for Apple to brand its AI features under an umbrella term like that, similar to how a bunch of disparate features that allow different Apple devices to interoperate are under the “ <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> ” umbrella. But there&#39;s no such thing, technically speaking, as “Continuity”. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s an Xcode project inside Apple named Continuity.xcodeproj, and all the code that supports everything from AirDrop to Sidecar to iPhone Mirroring to clipboard sharing is all implemented in the same framework of code. It&#39;s a marketing term, but a useful one — it helps Apple explain the features, and helps users understand them.</p><p> The same goes for “Apple Intelligence”. It doesn&#39;t exist as a single thing or project. It&#39;s a marketing term for a collection of features, apps, and services. Putting it all under a single obvious, easily remembered — and <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/design/print-design-publishing/apples-new-billboard-ads-are-um-not-great">easily promoted</a> — name makes it easier for users to understand that Apple is launching a new initiative. It also makes it easier for Apple to just say “ <em>These are the devices that qualify for all of these features, and other devices — older ones, less expensive ones — get none of them.</em> ”</p><p> Let&#39;s say Apple were to quietly abandon the dumb Image Playground app next year. It just disappears from iOS 19 and MacOS 16. That would just be Apple eliminating a silly app that almost no one uses or should use. That wouldn&#39;t be a setback or rollback of “Apple Intelligence”. I would actually argue that axing Image Playground would improve Apple Intelligence; its mere existence greatly lowers the expectations for how good the whole thing is. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-12">1</a></sup></p><p> What I mean by that is that it was clear to me from the WWDC keynote onward that some of the features and aspects of Apple Intelligence were more ambitious than others. Some were downright trivial; others were proposing to redefine how we will do our jobs and interact with our most-used devices. That was clear. But yet somehow I didn&#39;t focus on it. Apple itself strongly hinted that the various features in Apple Intelligence wouldn&#39;t all ship at the same time. What they didn&#39;t spell out, but anyone could intuit, was that the more trivial features would ship first, and the more ambitious features later. That&#39;s where the red flags should have been obvious to me.</p><p> In broad strokes, there are four stages of “doneness” or “realness” to features announced by any company:</p><ol><li><p> Features that the company&#39;s own product representatives will demo, themselves, in front of the media. Smaller, more personal demonstrations are more credible than on-stage demos. But the stakes for demo fail are higher in an auditorium full of observers.</p></li><li><p> Features that the company will allow members of the media (or other invited outside observers and experts) to try themselves, for a limited time, under the company&#39;s supervision and guidance. Vision Pro demos were like this at WWDC 2023. A bunch of us got to use pre-release hardware and in-progress software for 30 minutes. It wasn&#39;t like free range “Do whatever you want” — it was a guided tour. But we were the ones actually using the product. Apple allowed hands-on demos for a handful of media (not me) at Macworld Expo <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/186251/ihnatkoiphone.html">back in 2007 with prototype original iPhones</a> — some of the “apps” were just screenshots, but most of the iPhone actually worked.</p></li><li><p> Features that are released as beta software for developers, enthusiasts, and the media to use on their own devices, without limitation or supervision.</p></li><li><p> Features that actually ship to regular users, and hardware that regular users can just go out and buy.</p></li></ol><p> As of today — March 2025 — every feature in Apple Intelligence <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/26/this-is-every-apple-intelligence-feature-thats-available-now/">that has actually shipped</a> was at level 1 back at WWDC. After the keynote, dozens of us in the press were invited to a series of small-group briefings where we got to watch Apple reps demo features like Writing Tools, Photos Clean Up, Genmoji, and more. We got to see predictive code completion in Xcode. What has shipped, as of today, they were able to show, in some functional state, in June.</p><p> For example, there was a demo involving a draft email message on an iPad, and the Apple rep used Writing Tools to make it “more friendly”. I was in a group of just four or five other members of the media, watching this. As usual, we were encouraged to interrupt with questions. Knowing that LLMs are non-deterministic, I asked whether, as the Apple rep was performing this same demo for each successive group of media members, the “more friendly” result was exactly the same each time. He laughed and said no — that while the results are very similar each time, and he hopes they continue to be (hence the laughing), there were subtle differences <em>sometimes</em> between different runs of the same demo. As I recall, he even used Undo to go back to the original message text, invoked Writing Tools to make it “more friendly” again, and we could see that a few of the word choices were slightly different. That answered both my explicit question and my implicit one: Writing Tools generates non-deterministic results, and, more importantly, what we were watching really was a live demo.</p><p> We didn&#39;t get to try any of the Apple Intelligence features ourselves. There was no Apple Intelligence “hands on”. But we did see a bunch of features demoed, live, by Apple folks. In my above hierarchy of realness, they were all at level 1.</p><p> But we didn&#39;t see <em>all</em> aspects of Apple Intelligence demoed. None of the “more personalized Siri” features, the ones that Apple, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">in its own statement announcing their postponement</a> , described as having “more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps”. Those features encompass three main things:</p><ul><li> “Personal context” — Knowing details and information about you from a “semantic index”, built from the contents of your email, messages, files, contacts, and more. In theory, eventually, all the information on your device that you wish to share with Siri will be in this semantic index. If you can look it up on your device, Siri will be able to look it up on your device.</li><li> “Onscreen awareness” — Giving Siri awareness of whatever is displayed on your screen. <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple&#39;s own example usage</a> : “If a friend texts you their new address, you can say &#39;Add this address to their contact card,&#39; and Siri will take care of it.”</li><li><p> “In-app actions” — Giving Siri the ability, through the App Intents framework, to do things in and across apps that <em>you</em> can do, the old fashioned way (yourself) in and across apps. Again, here&#39;s Apple&#39;s own example usage:</p><blockquote><p> You can make a request like “Send the email I drafted to April and Lilly” and Siri knows which email you&#39;re referencing and which app it&#39;s in. And Siri can take actions across apps, so after you ask Siri to enhance a photo for you by saying “Make this photo pop,” you can ask Siri to drop it in a specific note in the Notes app — without lifting a finger.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> There were no demonstrations of <em>any</em> of that. Those features were all at level 0 on my hierarchy. That level is called vaporware. They were features Apple <em>said</em> existed, which they <em>claimed</em> would be shipping in the next year, and which they <em>portrayed</em> , to great effect, in the signature “Siri, when is my mom&#39;s flight landing?” segment of the WWDC keynote itself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=4934">starting around the 1h:22m mark</a> . Apple was either unwilling or unable to demonstrate those features in action back in June, even with Apple product marketing reps performing the demos from a prepared script using prepared devices.</p><p> This shouldn&#39;t have just raised a concern in my head. It should have set off blinding red flashing lights and deafening klaxon alarms.</p><p> Even the very engineers working on a project never know exactly how long something is going to take to complete. An outsider observing a scripted demo of incomplete software knows far less (than the engineers) just how much more work it needs. But you can make a rough judgment. And that&#39;s where my aforementioned hierarchy of realness comes into play. Even outsiders can judge how close a public beta (stage 3) feels to readiness. A feature or product that Apple will allow the press to play with, hands-on (stage 2) is further along than a feature or product that Apple is only willing to demonstrate themselves (stage 1).</p><p> But a feature or product that Apple is unwilling to demonstrate, at all, is unknowable. Is it mostly working, and close to, but not quite, demonstratable? Is it only kinda sorta working — partially functional, but far from being complete? Fully functional but prone to crashing — or in the case of AI, prone to hallucinations and falsehoods? Or is it complete fiction, just an idea at this point?</p><p> What Apple showed regarding the upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was <em>not</em> a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">The Apple that commissioned the futuristic “Knowledge Navigator” concept video</a> in 1987 was the Apple that was on a course to near-bankruptcy a decade later. Modern Apple — the post-NeXT-reunification Apple of the last quarter century — does not publish concept videos. They only demonstrate actual working products and features.</p><p> Until WWDC last year, that is.</p><p> My deeply misguided mental framework for “Apple Intelligence” last year at WWDC was something like this: <em>Some of these features are further along than others, and Apple is showing us those features in action first, and they will surely be the features that ship first over the course of the next year. The other features must be coming to demonstratable status soon.</em> But the mental framework I should have used was more like this: <em>Some of these features are merely table stakes for generative AI in 2024, but others are ambitious, groundbreaking, and, given their access to personal data, potentially dangerous. Apple is only showing us the table-stakes features, and isn&#39;t demonstrating any of the ambitious, groundbreaking, risky features.</em></p><p>情况变得更糟。 Come September, Apple held its annual big event at Apple Park to unveil the iPhone 16 lineup. Apple Intelligence features were highlighted in the announcement. Members of the media from around the world were gathered. That was a new opportunity, three months after WWDC, for Apple to demonstrate — or even better, offer hands-on access to the press to try themselves — the new personalized Siri features.他们没有。 No demos, at all. But they did promote them, once again, in the event keynote. <sup id="fnr2-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn2-2025-03-12">2</a></sup></p><p> But yet while Apple still wouldn&#39;t demonstrate these features in person, they did commission and broadcast a TV commercial showing these purported features in action, presenting them as a reason to purchase a new iPhone — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature">a commercial they pulled, without comment, from YouTube this week</a> .</p><p> Last week&#39;s announcement — “It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year” — was, if you think about it, another opportunity to demonstrate the current state of these features. Rather than simply issue a statement to the media, they could have invited select members of the press to Apple Park, or Apple&#39;s offices in New York, or even just remotely over a WebEx conference call, and demonstrated the current state of these features live, on an actual device.那没有发生。 If these features exist in any sort of working state at all, no one outside Apple has vouched for their existence, let alone for their quality.</p><h2> Duke Nukem Intelligence</h2><p> Why did Apple show these personalized Siri features at WWDC last year, and promise their arrival during the first year of Apple Intelligence? Why, for that matter, do they now claim to “anticipate rolling them out in the coming year” if they still currently do not exist in demonstratable form? (If they <em>do</em> exist today in demonstratable form, they should, you know, <em>demonstrate them</em> .)</p><p> I&#39;m not trying to be obtuse here. It&#39;s obvious why some executives at Apple might have <em>hoped</em> they could promote features like these at WWDC last year. Generative AI is the biggest thing to happen in the computer industry since previous breakthroughs this century like mobile (starting with the iPhone, followed by Android), social media (Meta), and cloud computing (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon). Nobody knows where it&#39;s going but wherever it&#39;s heading, it&#39;s going to be big, important, and perhaps profitable. Wall Street certainly noticed. And prior to WWDC last year, Apple wasn&#39;t in the game. They needed to pitch their AI story. And a story that involved nothing but table-stakes AI features isn&#39;t nearly as compelling a story as one that involves innovative, breakthrough, ambitious personal features.</p><p> But while there&#39;s an obvious appeal to Apple pitching the most compelling, most ambitious AI story possible, the only thing that was essential was telling a story that was true. If the truth was that Apple only had features ready to ship in the coming year that were table stakes compared to the rest of the industry, that&#39;s the story they needed to tell. Put as good a spin on it as possible, but them&#39;s the breaks when you&#39;re late to the game.</p><p> The fiasco here is not that Apple is late on AI. It&#39;s also not that they had to announce an embarrassing delay on promised features last week. Those are problems, not fiascos, and problems happen. They&#39;re inevitable. Leaders prove their mettle and create their legacies not by how they deal with successes but by how they deal with — how they acknowledge, understand, adapt, and solve — problems. The fiasco is that Apple pitched a story that wasn&#39;t true, one that <em>some</em> people within the company surely understood wasn&#39;t true, and they set a course based on that.</p><p> The Apple of the Jobs exile years — the Sculley / Spindler / Amelio Apple of 1987–1997 — promoted all sorts of amazing concepts that were no more real than the dinosaurs of <em>Jurassic Park</em> , and promised all sorts of hardware and (especially) software that never saw the light of day. Promoting what you <em>hope</em> to be able to someday ship is way easier and more exciting than promoting what you <em>know</em> is actually ready to ship. However close to financial bankruptcy Apple was when Steve Jobs returned as CEO after the NeXT reunification, the company was already completely bankrupt of credibility. Apple today is the most profitable and financially successful company in the history of the world. Everyone notices such success, and the corresponding accumulation of great wealth. Less noticed, but to my mind the more impressive achievement, is that over the last three decades, the company <em>also</em> accumulated an abundant reserve of credibility. When Apple showed a feature, you could bank on that feature being real. When they said something was set to ship in the coming year, it would ship in the coming year. In the worst case, maybe that “year” would have to be stretched to 13 or 14 months. You can stretch the truth and maintain credibility, but you can&#39;t maintain credibility with bullshit. And the “more personalized Siri” features, it turns out, were bullshit.</p><p> Keynote by keynote, product by product, feature by feature, year after year after year, Apple went from a company that you couldn&#39;t believe would even remain solvent, to, by far, the most credible company in tech. Apple remains at no risk of financial bankruptcy (and in fact remains the most profitable company in the world). But their credibility is now damaged. Careers will end before Apple might ever return to the level of “if they say it, you can believe it” credibility the company had earned at the start of June 2024.</p><p> <em>Damaged</em> is arguably too passive. It was <em>squandered</em> . This didn&#39;t happen to Apple. Decision makers within the company did it.</p><p> <em>Who</em> decided these features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they&#39;d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment? Three months later, who decided Apple should double down and advertise these features in a TV commercial, and promote them as a selling point of the iPhone 16 lineup — not just any products, but the very crown jewels of the company and the envy of the entire industry — when those features still remained in such an unfinished or perhaps even downright non-functional state that they <em>still</em> could not be demoed to the press? Not just couldn&#39;t be shipped as beta software. Not just couldn&#39;t be used by members of the press in a hands-on experience, but could not even be shown to work by Apple employees on Apple-controlled devices in an Apple-controlled environment? But yet they advertised them in a commercial for the iPhone 16, when it turns out they won&#39;t ship, in the best case scenario, until months after the iPhone 17 lineup is unveiled?</p><p> When that whole campaign of commercials appeared, I — along with many other observers — was distracted by the fact that <em>none</em> of the features in Apple Intelligence had yet shipped. It&#39;s highly unusual, and arguably ill-considered, for Apple to advertise <em>any</em> features that haven&#39;t yet shipped. But one of those commercials was not at all like the others. The other commercials featured Apple Intelligence features that were close to shipping. We know today they were close to shipping because they were either in the iOS 18.1 betas already, in September, or would soon appear in developer betas for iOS 18.2 and 18.3. Right now, today, they&#39;ve all actually shipped and are in the hands of iPhone 16 users. But the “Siri, what&#39;s the name of the guy I had a meeting with a couple of months ago at Cafe Grenel?” commercial was entirely based on a feature Apple still has never even demonstrated.</p><p> Who said “ <em>Sure, let&#39;s promise this</em> ” and then “ <em>Sure, let&#39;s advertise it</em> ”? And who said “ <em>Are you crazy, this isn&#39;t ready, this doesn&#39;t work, we can&#39;t promote this now?</em> ” And most important, who made the call which side to listen to? Presumably, that person was Tim Cook.</p><p> Even with everything Apple overpromised (if not outright lied about) at the WWDC keynote, the initial takeaway from WWDC from the news media was wrongly focused on their partnership with OpenAI. The conventional wisdom coming out of the keynote was that Apple had just announced something called “Apple Intelligence” but it was powered by ChatGPT, when in fact, the story Apple told was that they — Apple — had built an entire system called Apple Intelligence, entirely powered by Apple&#39;s own AI technology, and that it spanned from on-device execution all the way to a new Private Cloud Compute infrastructure they not only owned but are powering with their own custom-designed server hardware based on Apple Silicon chips. And that on top of all that, as a proverbial cherry on top, Apple <em>also</em> was adding an optional integration layer with ChatGPT.</p><p> So, yes, given that the news media gave credit for Apple&#39;s own actual announced achievements to OpenAI, Apple surely would have been given even <em>less</em> credit had they not announced the “more personalized Siri” features. It&#39;s easy to imagine someone in the executive ranks arguing “ <em>We need to show something that only Apple can do.</em> ” But it turns out they announced something Apple <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do. And now they look so out of their depth, so in over their heads, that not only are they years behind the state-of-the-art in AI, but they don&#39;t even know <em>what</em> they can ship or <em>when</em> . Their headline features from nine months ago not only haven&#39;t shipped but still haven&#39;t even been demonstrated, which I, for one, now presume means they <em>can&#39;t</em> be demonstrated <em>because they don&#39;t work</em> .</p><h2> &#39;So Why the Fuck Doesn&#39;t It Do That?&#39;</h2><p> In May 2011, <a href="https://fortune.com/article/inside-apple/">Fortune published an extraordinary look inside Apple by Adam Lashinsky</a> , at what we now know to be the peak, and (alas) end, of the Steve Jobs era. The piece opens thus:</p><blockquote><p> Apple doesn&#39;t often fail, and when it does, it isn&#39;t a pretty sight at 1 Infinite Loop. In the summer of 2008, when Apple launched the first version of its iPhone that worked on third-generation mobile networks, it also debuted MobileMe, an e-mail system that was supposed to provide the seamless synchronization features that corporate users love about their BlackBerry smartphones. MobileMe was a dud. Users complained about lost e-mails, and syncing was spotty at best. Though reviewers gushed over the new iPhone, they panned the MobileMe service.</p><p> Steve Jobs doesn&#39;t tolerate duds. Shortly after the launch event, he summoned the MobileMe team, gathering them in the Town Hall auditorium in Building 4 of Apple&#39;s campus, the venue the company uses for intimate product unveilings for journalists. According to a participant in the meeting, Jobs walked in, clad in his trademark black mock turtleneck and blue jeans, clasped his hands together, and asked a simple question:</p><p> “Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?” Having received a satisfactory answer, he continued, “So why the fuck doesn&#39;t it do that?”</p><p> For the next half-hour Jobs berated the group. “You&#39;ve tarnished Apple&#39;s reputation,” he told them. “You should hate each other for having let each other down.” The public humiliation particularly infuriated Jobs. Walt Mossberg, the influential Wall Street Journal gadget columnist, had panned MobileMe. “Mossberg, our friend, is no longer writing good things about us,” Jobs said. On the spot, Jobs named a new executive to run the group.</p></blockquote><p> Tim Cook should have already held a meeting like that to address and rectify this Siri and Apple Intelligence debacle. If such a meeting hasn&#39;t yet occurred or doesn&#39;t happen soon, then, I fear, that&#39;s all she wrote. The ride is over. When mediocrity, excuses, and bullshit take root, they take over. A culture of excellence, accountability, and integrity cannot abide the acceptance of any of those things, and will quickly collapse upon itself with the acceptance of all three.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-12"><p> Image Playground would make a ton of sense not as a consumer-facing app, but as an example project for developers. Long ago, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/TextEdit/Introduction/Intro.html">used to share the source code for TextEdit</a> as an example project for Mac developers. (TextEdit is actually a low-key great application, though. It&#39;s genuinely useful, reliable, and understandable.) <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/wwdc/2024/">Apple shares tons of sample code at WWDC each year</a> . Image Playground would be a great sample project. The silly app icon even looks like something from a WWDC sample project. What Image Playground is <em>not</em> is a credible useful generative AI tool. Yet Apple keeps talking about it — and showing it off in new hardware demonstrations — like it&#39;s something they should be proud of and that anyone might credibly use for real-world work or even personal purposes. Image Playground does exemplify just how state-of-the-art the generative AI features are in Apple Intelligence, but not in the way Apple seems to think. <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-03-12"><p> Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uarNiSl_uh4?t=3184">the 53-minute mark of Apple&#39;s September “It&#39;s Glowtime” event</a> introducing the iPhones 16, and it&#39;s Craig Federighi who says the following:</p><blockquote><p> “Siri will be able to tap into your personal context to help you in ways that are unique to you. Like pulling up the recommendation for the TV show that your brother sent you last month. And Siri will gain onscreen awareness. So when your friend texts you about a new album, you&#39;ll be able to simply say, &#39;Play that.&#39; And then you&#39;ll be able to take hundreds of new actions in your apps, like updating a friend&#39;s contact card with his new address, or adding a set of photos to a specific album. With Siri&#39;s personal context understanding and action capabilities, you&#39;ll be able to simply say, &#39;Send Erica the photos from Saturday&#39;s barbecue&#39;, and Siri will dig up the photos and send them right off.”</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s about 40 seconds of keynote time I bet Federighi regrets — and that I suspect <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/09/siri-apple-intelligence-ios-18-development-went-wrong/">he was skeptical about</a> including. It&#39;s telling though that unlike WWDC, Apple didn&#39;t <em>show</em> those features or spend even a full minute talking about at the iPhone 16 event — despite the fact that, ostensibly, those features should have been three months closer to shipping than they were in June. Federighi&#39;s title is SVP of software, and Apple Intelligence and Siri are “software”, but John Giannandrea (SVP of machine learning and AI strategy) is Federighi&#39;s peer, not subordinate, <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">on the org chart</a> — both report directly to Tim Cook — and is responsible for Siri and Apple Intelligence. Why it was Federighi, not Giannandrea, pitching those features in the iPhone 16 event keynote almost certainly comes down to Federighi&#39;s presentation skills and stage presence, not responsibility for the features themselves. But who&#39;s going on camera to pitch these features and promise their future availability the next time? <a href="#fnr2-2025-03-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
