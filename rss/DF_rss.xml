<p>The Verge 的 David Pierce，“每个智能手机都应该是翻盖手机，从现在开始”：</p><blockquote><p>好吧，我已经说服你了，对吧？永远翻盖手机！问题是：目前市场上没有一款翻盖手机能兑现这一承诺。甚至没有很多可供选择。 Z Flip 4 做对了很多事情，但它被一个太小的前屏幕和一个恰到好处的摄像头设置所阻碍。新的 Razr Plus 看起来非常有前途，特别是因为它的前屏幕更大，尽管它的处理器和耐用性评级并不是特别令人印象深刻。我认为它也会让软件出错；让我在正面屏幕上运行完整的应用程序不仅愚蠢——它与翻盖手机的整体吸引力背道而驰。</p><p>我们需要的是竞争。这将使智能手机世界的其余部分，从苹果和谷歌到华为和 Oppo，再到 Nothing 和 OnePlus，都决定翻盖手机是未来。他们可以而且应该继续开发平板手机和可折叠手机，因为它们有自己的位置和用户。但我们在 2003 年做对了：最好的手机是翻盖手机。手机变得更智能，但它们的形状却变得更糟。现在是我们最终两全其美的时候了。</p></blockquote><p>我和其他人一样喜欢诚实的反向投资，但我不明白为什么任何公司都会制造其中之一，更不用说为什么皮尔斯会建议他们可能成为主流。就潜力而言，我有点了解可折叠设备——你携带一部双倍厚的矩形手机，以换取展开时平板电脑大小的大屏幕。我还没有看到一个看起来不错的，但我得到了基本概念的潜力——更大的屏幕更好，所有的事情都考虑到了。 <em>Westworld</em>的可折叠成袖珍手机的超薄平板电脑是我所见过的最好的愿景，而对<em>Westworld</em>平板电脑的最佳检查<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek">由 ...

<p>Jason Snell，在六种颜色上写道：</p><blockquote><p>老实说，这个霍夫曼家伙看起来确实像个撒谎的小人，Reddit 关于尊重第三方应用程序的所有公开声明似乎都是在试图对 Reddit 用户撒谎，这样他们看起来就不像坏人了。但最重要的是，Reddit 重新定价其 API 是为了让第三方应用程序破产。 （塞利格说他将在停工期间损失 250,000 美元。）</p></blockquote><p>很明显，霍夫曼最近的所有决定都是由 Reddit 希望进行的 IPO 推动的。一方面是 Reddit 的估值正在下降这一丑陋的事实。 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/fidelity-reddit-valuation/">TechCrunch 上周报道</a>：</p><blockquote><p>富达是 Reddit 2021 年最新一轮融资的主要投资者，自投资以来已将其在流行社交媒体平台的股权估值削减了 41%。 [...]</p><p>这种贬值是过去一年影响全球各种成长阶段初创公司的更广泛趋势的一部分，引发了人们对 Reddit 是否会保持其最初意图以 150 亿美元左右的估值上市的不确定性。</p></blockquote><p>另一方面是 OpenAI，目前受到天价估值的支撑，它使用 Reddit 内容作为其海量训练数据的一部分。这些 API 从免费变成非常昂贵的全部意义在于让 OpenAI 和类似的公司为它们付费。这是一个白日梦。 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-openai-chatgpt-ipo-valuation-karma-2023-6">Insider 的 Julie Bort</a> ：</p><blockquote><p> “Reddit 的数据语料库非常有价值。但我们不需要将所有这些价值免费提供给世界上一些最大的公司，”Reddit 首席执行官史蒂夫霍夫曼说。</p><p>我问 ChatGPT 是否会为 Reddit 数据付费。它告诉我它的训练数据截止日期是 2021 年 9 月，所以它不知道该日期之后发生了什么。</p></blockquote><p> Reddit 已经将其所有数据免费提供给大公司。霍夫曼现在正试图为几年前放出马厩的马匹收费。而且他显然不关心 Apollo 或其他第三方 Reddit 客户端，或者这些举措对 Reddit 作为平台供应商的声誉有何影响。他只是陷入了一种幻想，即投资者会以某种方式将 Reddit 视为当前 AI 炒作的参与者。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“Reddit 希望的 IPO 和从 OpenAI 的炒作中获利的白日梦”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/reddit-ipo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>面对 Reddit 过高的 API 定价，Christian Selig 正在关闭 Apollo </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40000</id><published> 2023-06-09T17:37:06Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T00:49:49Z</updated><author><name>约翰格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>MG西格勒：</p><blockquote><p>今天早些时候，世界上最伟大的足球运动员莱昂内尔·梅西<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-inter-miami-mls.html">宣布</a>将离开欧洲，加盟迈阿密国际。这很重要，因为<a href="https://500ish.com/a-most-beautiful-game-e3a3dcbd228d">fútbol</a> （足球）以及可以说是所有运动中的大腕即将来到美国。但这也很重要，因为他要来美国职业足球大联盟打球。与 Apple 有独家电视交易的联盟。因此，Apple 显然通过一项非凡的优惠来帮助吸引梅西：从他们的季票服务的新订阅者那里抽取收入。</p></blockquote><p>我很想知道梅西从苹果那里获得了多大的收入分成，但不管细节如何，这对 MLS 和 Apple TV+ 来说都是一次非凡的政变。只有少数运动员如此出色，如此受人喜爱，以至于他们可以单枪匹马地在一项团队运动中提升整个<em>联盟</em>。莱昂内尔·梅西就是其中之一。</p><blockquote><p>在早期看过 Vision Pro 的人中，似乎普遍赞扬 NBA 球场和 MLB 教练席演示。这些显然是用苹果制造的特殊相机拍摄的，这些相机能够捕捉到可以充分利用新设备观看体验的镜头。这种类型的内容可能需要一点时间才能在联盟中变得更加广泛和接受。你知道它不会在哪里吗？大联盟。<a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666535803068256259">我完全希望</a>Apple 很快就会用他们的新空间相机（我编造了这个名字，但它似乎是他们可能会使用的东西……）拍摄游戏，如果他们还没有开始的话！ Apple 并没有削弱这里的任何其他电视转播权（就像 NBA 那样），<a href="https://mgs.blog/skating-to-where-the-soccer-ball-will-be-bc889b8c368">他们拥有独家转播权</a>。<em>随时随地</em>在任何设备上显示任何游戏。</p></blockquote><p>在使用 Vision Pro 进行演示后，我突然想到，Apple 包括 NBA 篮球和 MLB 棒球的空间演示，但不包括 MLS 足球，这有点令人惊讶——体育 TV+ 是最全面的。 （当然，Apple 每周都会在全国广播 MLB 的周五晚上棒球赛。）但如果 Apple 不打算用这项技术广播整个 MLS 比赛，我会吃掉我的帽子。</p><blockquote><p>最后，第五点，就像苹果公司在推出 iPhone 时使用 AT&amp;T 作为他们的独家运营商一样，</strong"> <a href=”https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666536683251339272<strong>我可以看到他们</a>以类似的方式使用他们的 MLS 交易。也就是说，与愿意打破常规并允许 Apple 控制产品和服务的联盟/运营商合作。当它成功时，看着其他联盟/运营商为了排队而被自己绊倒。它适用于 iPhone。它会在这里工作吗？感觉是一个不错的赌注。</p></blockquote><p>这正是我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos#fn2-2023-06-07">本周在第一印象文章的脚注中</a>提到的，尤其是 NFL 可能犯了一个巨大的错误，与谷歌就周日门票转播权签署了一项长期协议。西格勒将苹果公司如何利用其与 AT&amp;T 的最初独家协议与 iPhone 进行比较，这似乎是恰当的。</p><p><strong>更新：</strong> Apple 还宣布了<a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-scores-with-documentary-series-featuring-legendary-football-champion-lionel-messi-and-his-fifa-world-cup-career-culminating-in-his-dramatic-qatar-2022-win/">一个由四部分组成的关于梅西职业生涯的纪录片系列</a>即将登陆 TV+。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“莱昂内尔·梅西即将加盟美国职业足球大联盟，并与苹果达成收入分成协议”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/messi-apple">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv2" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.39998</id><published> 2023-06-07T18:21:22Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T03:41:45Z</updated><author><name>约翰格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">与 iPhone 引入的多点触控消除了概念抽象层的方式相同——无需触摸鼠标或触控板将屏幕上的指针移动到屏幕上的对象，你只需触摸屏幕上的对象——VisionOS 删除了一个空间抽象层。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>周一下午，我在 Apple Park 花了大约 30 分钟的时间使用 Vision Pro 和 VisionOS，在 Apple 专门为这次体验建造的临时“场地屋”里。这是与 Vision 产品营销团队成员进行的一对一导览，基本规则是我可以谈论我所经历的一切，但不允许照片和视频。</p><p> 30分钟非常快，总之体验是身临其境。我愿意花很多钱再次跑完全相同的 30 分钟。</p><p>时间远远不够，我也无法偏离准备好的演示的轨道。很明显，操作系统和应用程序远未完成。但即使考虑到演示的简洁性和软件当前状态的限制，我还是有信心描述一些事情。</p><p>第一：整体技术非凡，远超我的预期。<a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">就像我的朋友和 Dithering 的联合主持人 Ben Thompson 一样</a>，我的期望很高。苹果超过了他们。 Vision Pro 和 VisionOS 感觉它们已经从未来被及时拉了过来。自从 2007 年推出第一代 iPhone 以来，我就没有对新产品有过这种感觉。体验的几个方面让人感觉不可思议。</p><p>它是一个引人注目的<em>产品</em>吗？史蒂夫·乔布斯 (Steve Jobs) 有一句著名的格言，即技术是不够的，您无法制造引人注目的产品——更不用说整个平台了——从先进技术开始并向后工作。您从产品和平台体验的愿景开始，然后创造新技术使其成为现实。我只是不能说 Vision Pro 是否会成为一款引人注目的产品。我花的时间太少了，今天的软件还远未完成，最重要的是，整个体验太过全新和令人费解，无法得出任何这样的结论。</p><p>但 Vision Pro 在多个用例中成为引人注目的产品的潜力是显而易见的。这可能很棒。毫无疑问，它很有趣，而且我认为 Apple 为 VisionOS 设计的基本概念框架为长远的未来奠定了基础。第一代 Vision Pro 可能会也可能不会是一款成功的产品——我只是不想在这方面进行推测。但即使是对 VisionOS 的一点点尝试也让我充满信心，相信它将成为 Apple 和 Apple 开发人员的下一个主要平台，与 MacOS 和 iOS/iPadOS 并驾齐驱。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-07">1个</a></sup></p><hr /><p>几年前，我不再戴隐形眼镜，而是全天佩戴矫正眼镜。在我演示之前，Apple 的一位代表拿走了我的眼镜，并使用一个设备来测量我的镜片，为我的演示装置提供矫正镜片插入物。只用了大约三四分钟。当 Vision Pro 明年上市销售时，购买矫正镜片插入物可能就像从 Warby Parker 等零售商处在线购买眼镜一样——您需要提供眼科医生开具的处方副本。对于我们戴眼镜的人来说，这会有点麻烦，但不会太大，而且是不可避免的。 （我在不戴眼镜的情况下近距离看得很清楚，所以我很好奇在不戴矫正镜片的情况下使用 Vision Pro 的效果如何。）在镜头测量之后，我使用 iPhone 进行了简短的面部扫描，类似于注册 Face ID（看在电话前，将头转一圈），然后进行耳朵扫描。该测试用于确定最能阻挡光线的光密封件，并校准扬声器。</p><p>我的演示是在一个相对宽敞的客厅里进行的。我坐在沙发上。可以说，我的产品营销部导游坐在沙发旁边的扶手椅上。我们花了几分钟时间调整表带，让它戴在我脸上很舒服。我的光封很好，但并不完美。我的演示体验中最大的一个缺点是 Vision Pro 在您脸上的感觉比我希望的要重。这并不令人不舒服——至少 30 分钟内不会——但我从未忘记它在那里，它只是让你的头感觉有点前倾。</p><p>佩戴 Vision Pro 的首次运行体验需要进行几分钟非常简单的眼动追踪校准练习。你保持头部不动，VisionOS 在你面前显示一系列点，在纯黑色背景上。只移动你的眼睛，而不是你的头，你只需在它们出现时看着你面前的每个点。一两分钟后，砰，你进来了。</p><p>你最初看到的只是……你的世界。你只能看到你所在的房间。没有状态信息，没有元数据，没有指示器。只需从耳机正面的摄像头输入，呈现在您眼前的显示屏上。它并没有神奇地看起来与现实生活无异，但它<em>根本</em>不像是在看屏幕。我感觉完全没有延迟。我绝对看不到像素——体验是“视网膜”质量。 Apple 尚未说明 Vision Pro 的运行帧率，但我猜测它的运行速度为每秒 90 帧，甚至更高。</p><p>同样，它看起来一点也不像在耳机内看屏幕。它看起来像现实，尽管是通过一副安全眼镜或一个覆盖面部的大透明防护罩之类的东西。视野中没有边界——您通过 Vision Pro 的视野与没有​​它时您通过眼睛看到的完全一致。最令人印象深刻和不可思议的是，视野似乎与您自然看到的<em>完全</em>吻合。它甚至没有稍微宽一点的角度，甚至没有稍微长一点的远摄。没有鱼眼效应，周边视觉也没有像差或扭曲。当您将 Vision Pro 举过眼睛时，您在脸部看到的景象与您亲眼看到的景象完全一致。想象一下，一副经过玻璃处理的安全眼镜让世界看起来有点像“胶片”。轻微的色调（到明年，这种色调可能会变得更接近现实——对我来说，从颜色上看，它感觉非常温暖），所有的东西都有一点视觉上的平滑感。</p><p>要在 VisionOS 中执行任何操作，首先要单击右眼上方的数字表冠按钮。 （左侧顶部的另一个按钮将用于拍摄空间照片和视频，但该按钮昨天在我们的演示设备上被禁用）。按下数字表冠按钮和吊杆，您的应用程序图标主屏幕出现在您面前的平面上。长按数字表冠按钮，它会将您的虚拟世界重新置于您现在正在查看的内容前面。</p><p> VisionOS 的导航模型是对概念简单性的突破。您只需看着某样东西，然后用食指和拇指在您的任意一只手上轻敲。由于找不到更好的动词，我将其称为“敲击”。当您在 VisionOS 中查看任何可点击的 UI 元素时，它会在视觉上突出显示。这种突出显示与使用触控板或鼠标时 iPadOS 中的悬停效果极为相似。在 iPadOS 中，如果将鼠标指针圆圈移动到按钮或图标上，该按钮/图标会在视觉上弹出一点。如果您查看 VisionOS 中的按钮或图标，该按钮/图标会弹出一点。某些应用程序的工具栏带有深色背景和灰色按钮图标。查看一个按钮，该按钮将变为白色。在看着它的同时轻按你的手指和拇指，它就会激活。就是这样。难以置信的简单，惊人的有效。</p><p>起初我发现自己伸手去捏我面前看到的图标和按钮。就像如果我想激活 Safari，我会把手伸向 Safari 图标并捏它。那很好用。但这是完全没有必要的。你真的可以把手放在膝盖上。当你试图在你的视野中捏住实际的虚拟图标时它会起作用，因为你正在看着图标，你的手指和拇指会点击，但你的手可以在任何地方。重要的是你在看什么。 It started feeling natural within just a minute or two, and I could feel myself navigating the interface faster as the demo went on.</p><p> The next most striking aspect of the experience is that everything in VisionOS is completely stable in space. Let&#39;s say you open a Safari window, then open a Messages window next to it. (You can move windows around the room by pinching and dragging on a “Window Bar” that hovers underneath every window. You can move windows left/right, up/down, <em>and</em> closer/further away from you.) Then you turn your head 90 degrees to your side, then turn your head to the other side, and then return your gaze to the center. Those windows for Safari and Messages do not move at all, relative to the real world. Not even a little. You know how when you use AR on an iPhone or iPad — the built-in Measure app is a perfect example — and virtual UI elements or items move around a little bit relative to reality as you pan and rotate the iPhone or iPad? There&#39;s nothing like that in VisionOS. Virtual elements are utterly stable. Obviously that&#39;s what you <em>want</em> in an XR experience, but to my knowledge no other headset can achieve this stability. My understanding is that this profound stability — this palpable <em>realness</em> of virtual elements — is thanks to the extraordinary precise eye-tracking that Vision Pro achieves. <em>Uncanny</em> is often a pejorative — eg with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> — but in this case I use it as strong praise. It is simply uncanny how Vision Pro makes virtual elements as spatially stable as the walls and furniture and people in the room around you.</p><p> There&#39;s also a top-level “Environments” tab on the left side of the home screen. Everything I&#39;ve described thus far took place in the de facto default “environment” which is your actual surroundings. But the Environments tab allows you to switch from pass-through camera reality to a virtual reality. One of the locations I experienced was Mount Hood. Choose it and it&#39;s like you&#39;re there. These environments are incredibly immersive, 360 degrees. And so instead of catching up on Mail and Messages in floating windows in your living room, you can do it while it appears like you&#39;re atop a mountain, or on a beach, or, well, anywhere. It&#39;s beautiful, and every bit as stable spatially as pass-through reality. When you&#39;re in an immersive environment, you can turn the digital crown to adjust how far it wraps around your field of vision. Fully immersive means you don&#39;t see anything from your actual physical environment; partial immersion dials it back from your periphery to the center, with blurred dream-like edges.</p><p> Lastly, “breakthrough” is Apple&#39;s term for a feature that identifies real human beings who approach you while immersed. They sort of fade in, as transparent ghosts. But not spooky ghosts. It&#39;s a seamless feature, and given my experience with other VR headsets, a necessary one to avoid being isolated from the people around you once you&#39;re immersed. You see someone fade into view, and you can turn the digital crown to dial back the degree of immersion and truly look at them.</p><hr /><p> Apple is <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1665806600261763072">promoting</a> the Vision Pro announcement as the launch of “the era of spatial computing”. That term feels perfect. It&#39;s not AR, VR, or XR. It&#39;s spatial computing, and some <em>aspects</em> of spatial computing are AR or VR.</p><p> To me the Macintosh has always felt more like a <em>place</em> than a <em>thing</em> . Not a place I go physically, but a place my mind goes intellectually. When I&#39;m working or playing and in the flow, it has always felt like MacOS is where I <em>am</em> . I&#39;m in the Mac. Interruptions — say, the doorbell or my phone ringing — are momentarily disorienting when I&#39;m in the flow on the Mac, because I&#39;m pulled out of that world and into the physical one. There&#39;s a similar effect with iOS too, but I&#39;ve always found it less profound. Partly that&#39;s the nature of iOS, which doesn&#39;t speak to me, idiomatically, like MacOS does. I think in many ways that explains why I never feel <em>in the flow</em> on an iPad like I can on a Mac, even with the same size display. But with the iPhone in particular screen size is an important factor. I don&#39;t think <em>any</em> hypothetical phone OS could be as immersive as I find MacOS, simply because even the largest phone display is so small. Watching a movie on a phone is a lesser experience than watching on a big TV set, and watching a movie on even a huge TV is a lesser experience than watching a movie in a nice theater. We humans are visual creatures and our field of view affects our sense of importance. Size matters.</p><p> The <em>worlds</em> , as it were, of MacOS and iOS (or Windows, or Android, or whatever) are defined and limited by the displays on which they run. If MacOS is a place I go mentally when working, that place is manifested physically by the Mac&#39;s display. It&#39;s like the playing field, or the court, in sports — it has very clear, hard and fast, rectangular bounds. It is of fixed size and shape, and everything I do in that world takes place in the confines of those display boundaries.</p><p> VisionOS is very much going to be a conceptual place like that for work. But there is no display. There are no boundaries. The intellectual “place” where the apps of VisionOS are presented is the real-world place in which you use the device, or the expansive virtual environment you choose. The room in which you&#39;re sitting is the canvas. The whole room. The display on a Mac or iOS device is to me like a portal, a rectangular window into a well-defined virtual world. With VisionOS the virtual world is the actual world around you.</p><p> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. Using a Mac, you are in a physical place, there is a display in front of you in that place, and on that display are application windows. Using VisionOS, there are just application windows in the physical place in which you are. On Monday I had Safari and Messages and Photos open, side by side, each in a window that seemed the size of a movie poster — that is to say, each app in a window that appeared larger than any actual computer display I&#39;ve ever used. All side by side. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Some of the videos in Apple&#39;s Newsroom post</a> introducing Vision Pro illustrate this. But seeing a picture of an actor in this environment doesn&#39;t do justice to experiencing it firsthand, because a photo showing this environment itself has defined rectangular borders.</p><p> This is not confusing or complex, but it feels profound. Last night I chatted with a friend who, I found out only then, has been using Vision Pro for months inside Apple. While talking about this “your real world room is your canvas for arranging your application windows” aspect of the experience, he said that he spent weeks feeling a bit constrained, keeping his open VisionOS windows all in front of him as though on a virtual display, before a colleague opened his mind to <em>spreading out</em> and making applications windows much larger and arranging them in a wider carousel not merely in front of him but <em>around</em> him. The constraints of even the largest physical display simply do not exist with VisionOS.</p><hr /><p> I&#39;d group everything I experienced Monday into three loose categories.</p><p> The first, for lack of a better term, is simply “computing”. Work, as it were. Reading web pages, talking via FaceTime, reading email or messages. Using <em>apps</em> . You start with an iOS-like grid of app icons, tap on apps to open them in windows, and arrange and resize those windows however you want. Text is very readable in windows. My brief 30 minute demo covered a lot, so I have zero perspective on how pleasant or tolerable it is to read for long stretches of time, but my impression is that it&#39;s more than fine. Windows look solid, text looks crisp, and you can make windows really big in virtual space. If anything is going to seem weird or wrong about long-form reading in VisionOS, it&#39;s not the visual fidelity, but rather the fact that I&#39;ve never once in my life read an article or email message in a window that appeared 4 or 5 feet tall.</p><p> The second type of experience is the consumption of 2D content, like photos and videos. Watching a regular movie on a virtual huge screen is incredible. It&#39;s way more like watching a movie in a real cinema than like watching on a TV. One of the movies Apple had us watch was James Cameron&#39;s <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> , both in a window floating in front of us, and then in “theater mode”, which immersively removes your actual physical surroundings. Cameron shot <em>Avatar 2</em> with state-of-the-art 3D cameras, and the 3D effect was, as promised, better than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in a theater or theme park. I don&#39;t generally like 3D feature-length movies at all — I find myself not remembering them afterwards — but I might watch movies like <em>Avatar</em> this way with Vision Pro. But even though <em>Avatar</em> is 3D, it&#39;s still a rectangular movie. It&#39;s just presented as a very large rectangle with very compelling 3D depth inside that rectangle.</p><p> The third type of experience is fully immersive. Content Apple commissioned and created that is inherently only consumable in three dimensions. Full immersion, like transporting you to a cliff&#39;s edge atop a mountain, or lakeside on a beautiful spring day. Some of these immersive environments surround you completely — you can turn around 360 degrees, and look up at the sky or down at the ground (or, dizzyingly, down over the cliff&#39;s edge). Another custom experience involved a portal opening on the wall across the room, out of which first flew a small butterfly that landed on my extended finger. This is so compelling that some of the media people who experienced it had their minds tricked into <em>feeling</em> the butterfly land. I did not, but I can see why they did. Then, a dinosaur — a velociraptor-looking thing, seemingly about 9 or 10 feet tall — approached the “portal” in the wall and came halfway through into the room. I was invited to stand up from the couch and approach it. There was a coffee table in front of the couch, a possible shin-banging accident waiting to happen, but the pass-through video experience is so seamless, so natural, so much like just looking through glasses, not looking at a screen inside a headset, that it took no concentration or carefulness at all on my part to stand up and walk around the coffee table and approach the dinosaur. The dinosaur was not pre-recorded. It reacted, live, to me, keeping eye contact with me at all times. It was spooky, and a significant part of my own lizard brain was instinctively <em>very</em> alarmed. I got extremely close to the dinosaur&#39;s head, and the illusion that it was real never broke down. Even up close, there was no sign that it was composed of polygons stitched together or something. It looked like a 10-foot tall dinosaur that could kill me with a snap of its jaws, right there in the room with me, as close to my face as the MacBook Pro display on which I&#39;m writing these words is right now.</p><p> Spatial photos and videos — photos and videos shot with the Vision Pro itself — are viewed as a sort of hybrid between 2D content and fully immersive 3D content. They don&#39;t appear in a crisply defined rectangle. Rather, they appear with a hazy dream-like border around them. Like some sort of teleportation magic spell in a Harry Potter movie or something. The effect reminded me very much of Steven Spielberg&#39;s <em>Minority Report</em> , in the way that Tom Cruise&#39;s character <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">could obsessively watch “memories” of his son</a> , and the way the psychic “precogs” perceive their visions of murders about to occur. It&#39;s like watching a dream, but through a portal opened into another world.</p><p> Lastly, we saw two sports demos: an at-bat from a baseball game at Fenway Park (Phil Schiller&#39;s hands are all over that one), and a scoring play from a Nuggets-Suns NBA basketball game. For the baseball game, the perspective wasn&#39;t even from the stands, but rather from the home team&#39;s dugout, ground level, right behind first base. It&#39;s not quite <em>just</em> like being there, but it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like being there. It&#39;s more realistic than seems possible. You choose where to direct your gaze: at the batter at home plate, at the pitcher, or out in the outfield. Or above the outfielders, at the scoreboard. For the NBA game, the perspective was courtside, right behind the basket. But better than the actual courtside perspective, because the perspective was slightly elevated above seating level. Fully immersive, fully three-dimensional, and seemingly perfectly to scale. Kevin Durant looked about 6&#39;10&quot;, right in front of me. Getting the scale just right is obviously the correct way to present this, but it seems devilishly tricky to actually pull off. Apple has pulled it off. These baseball and basketball scenes were shot by Apple using entirely custom camera rigs, and stored in altogether new file formats. This is nothing at all like 2D footage extrapolated into 3D, or just painted on a virtual circular wall around you. It looks real. It seems as profoundly different from watching regular TV telecasts of sports as TV telecasts are from audio-only radio broadcasts. <sup id="fnr2-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn2-2023-06-07">2</a></sup> It was incredible. I would genuinely consider buying a Vision Pro if the one and only thing it did was show entire sporting events like this.</p><p> The first two types of experiences — doing computer “work”, and watching 2D and 2D-ish 3D content, have analogs to existing experiences. Using Safari in VisionOS is like using Safari on a Mac or iPad, but with a different presentation. Watching a movie in VisionOS is just watching a movie, albeit with the completely convincing illusion that you&#39;re looking at an enormous room-filling cinema screen. But the third, these original immersive experiences, have no analogs except to the real world. It&#39;s extraordinary, and only possible because Apple has gotten so many little things so exactly right.</p><p> I walked away from my demo more than a bit discombobulated. Not because it was disorienting or even the least bit nauseating, but because it was so unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. It strikes me that in some ways Bob Iger&#39;s cameo during the keynote had the relationship between Apple and Disney backwards. Iger spent his keynote cameo talking about Disney creating original new content for VisionOS&#39;s new medium. But after experiencing it, it felt more like what Disney should want is Apple providing this technology for Disney to use in their theme parks. The sports and dinosaur demos I experienced using Vision Pro were in many ways more immersive and thrilling than tentpole major attractions I&#39;ve experienced at Disney World.</p><p> Are you going to want to buy a Vision Pro for $3,500? That price is high enough that the answer is probably not, for most of you, no matter how compelling it is. But are you going to want to try one out for an hour or two, and find yourself craving another hour or two? I guarantee it. You need to see it. <sup id="fnr3-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn3-2023-06-07">3个</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-07"><p>I mean no disrespect to WatchOS or even tvOS by leaving them off that list.

<p>Science fiction writer Ted Chiang, in an interview with Madhumita Murgia for The Financial Times ( <a href="https://archive.is/2023.06.04-050658/https://www.ft.com/content/c1f6d948-3dde-405f-924c-09cc0dcf8c84">Archive.is link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Chiang&#39;s main objection, a writerly one, is with the words we choose to describe all this. Anthropomorphic language such as “learn”, “understand”, “know” and personal pronouns such as “I” that AI engineers and journalists project on to chatbots such as ChatGPT create an illusion. This hasty shorthand pushes all of us, he says — even those intimately familiar with how these systems work — towards seeing sparks of sentience in AI tools, where there are none.</p><p> “There was an exchange on Twitter a while back where someone said, &#39;What is artificial intelligence?&#39; And someone else said, &#39;A poor choice of words in 1954&#39;,” he says. “And, you know, they&#39;re right. I think that if we had chosen a different phrase for it, back in the &#39;50s, we might have avoided a lot of the confusion that we&#39;re having now.”</p><p> So if he had to invent a term, what would it be? His answer is instant: applied statistics.</p></blockquote><p> My puerile mind is tempted to make a joke that tacking on “system” would make for a fun acronym, but I shan&#39;t crack that joke, as I think Chiang makes a strong point here. What we have with these LLMs isn&#39;t low-level intelligence but rather high-level applied statistics that creates the powerful illusion of low-level intelligence.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> Chiang&#39;s very short story “ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a">What&#39;s Expected of Us</a> ”, referenced in the interview.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ted Chiang on AI: ‘The Machines We Have Now Are Not Conscious’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/04/chiang-ai">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sky Guide </title><link href="https://www.fifthstarlabs.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uux" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/03/sky-guide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39993</id><published> 2023-06-04T02:15:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-04T02:15:34Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mike Masnick, writing at TechDirt:</p><blockquote><p> Basically, a manufactured martyrdom controversy, combined with Twitter pretending to stand up to encouraging hatred, only for Musk to double down that hate has a comfy, welcoming home on Twitter.</p><p> Of course, in the midst of all this, the news came out that Ella Irwin, who had been leading trust and safety since relatively early in the Elon Musk reign, and who had been on Twitter through Wednesday directly responding to trust and safety requests, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-management-idUSKBN2XN3WY">had resigned</a> and was no longer at the company.

The monthly subscription price is unchanged.</p><p> Although Apple does not release viewership figures, Apple SVP of services Eddy Cue commented this week that MLS Season Pass had exceeded its own expectations and doing “much better than forecasted” in terms of both subscription and viewership numbers.</p></blockquote><p> We&#39;ll have to take Cue at his word on that, given that Apple never released its forecast nor is releasing viewership numbers now, but I&#39;m not surprised.

Over 53% of respondents said they moved to iPhone because of problems with their Android smartphone. Specifics cited were “their old phone did not serve them, because it was aging, needed repair, or had some deficiency that affected their user experience.” The second most common reason to switch was for new features on iPhone like “a better camera, enhanced accessory options, or a more intuitive user interface.” [...]</p><p> Finally, just 6% of those who switched from Android to iPhone said they made the move because of iMessage and FaceTime.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s easier, and more comfortable, for Google to argue that it&#39;s all about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/01/seeing_green">the green bubbles</a> .

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/bally-sports-stiffs-the-padres">Speaking of the demise of regional sports networks</a> , here&#39;s Todd Spangler reporting for Variety:</p><blockquote><p> As streaming video continues its ascendancy, cable, satellite and internet TV providers in the US turned in their worst subscriber losses to date in the first quarter of 2023 — collectively shedding 2.3 million customers in the period, according to analyst estimates. [...] With the Q1 decline, total pay-TV penetration of occupied US households (including for internet services like YouTube TV and Hulu) dropped to 58.5% — its lowest point since 1992, two years before DirecTV launched as a new rival to cable TV, according to Moffett&#39;s calculations. [...]</p><p> Google&#39;s YouTube TV was the only provider tracked by MoffettNathanson that picked up subs in Q1, adding an estimated 300,000 subscribers in the period (to reach about 6.3 million) and netting 1.4 million subscribers over the past year. [...]</p><p> Pay TV is suffering from what Moffett calls “the impoverishment cycle,” in which higher sports-broadcast fees have driven retail prices higher — thereby fueling cord-cutting and forcing distributors to increase prices to compensate. Even ESPN, one-time stalwart of the traditional ecosystem, has conceded that there will be a day when a la carte streaming is a viable option, Moffett noted.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;ll be interesting to see how much YouTube TV growth is juiced by <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/">NFL Sunday Ticket later this year</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘U.S. Pay-TV Subscriptions Fall to Lowest Levels Since 1992’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/pay-tv-decline">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Reddit API Pricing Would Cost Apollo Developer $20 Million Per Year </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uui" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/reddit-apollo-api-pricing" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39978</id><published> 2023-05-31T18:31:00Z</published><updated> 2023-05-31T18:32:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Christian Selig, developer of the splendid Reddit client <a href="https://apolloapp.io/">Apollo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ll cut to the chase: 50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure far more than I ever could have imagined.</p><p> Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month, which is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I&#39;d be in the red every month.</p><p> I&#39;m deeply disappointed in this price. Reddit iterated that the price would be A) reasonable and based in reality, and B) they would not operate like Twitter. Twitter&#39;s pricing was <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone">publicly ridiculed</a> for its obscene price of $42,000 for 50 million tweets. Reddit&#39;s is still $12,000. For reference, I pay Imgur, a site similar to Reddit in userbase and media, $166 for the same 50 million API calls.</p></blockquote><p> Selig does some ballpark math and estimates that Reddit currently generates about $0.12 in revenue per month per active user. The average Apollo user would cost $2.50 per month in API fees — 20× higher.</p><p> Right now Apollo is free to use, but offers a Pro tier with a slew of additional features and fun stuff for a one-time payment of $5, and an Ultra tier with even more for a $13/year subscription. If Reddit goes through with this API pricing, Apollo&#39;s free and Pro tiers would be unsustainable, and the Ultra subscription would have to cost at least $50 or $60 per year.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reddit API Pricing Would Cost Apollo Developer $20 Million Per Year’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/reddit-apollo-api-pricing">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Matt Birchler on Apple and Gaming </title><link href="https://birchtree.me/blog/macs-already-run-the-most-popular-pc-games-no-one-cares/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uuh" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/birchler-apple-gaming" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39977</id><published> 2023-05-31T18:30:00Z</published><updated> 2023-06-01T14:59:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Matt Birchler:</p><blockquote><p> I would not be surprised if <em>No Man&#39;s Sky</em> releases for Apple&#39;s VR headset on day one, and it gets lots of press as it will likely be one of the few games there at launch, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an indication of Apple really “getting” gaming in a meaningful way.</p><p> Personally, I just don&#39;t think Apple has it in them to get high end gaming to click on their platforms. Yes, they make a ton of money on iOS games, but poke your head into the App Store top charts and you can pretty clearly see they&#39;re making that money on shitty free-to-play games that rely on whales to spend absurd amounts of money on gems and tokens and whatever else.</p></blockquote><p> Let&#39;s put aside revenue as a measure of a platform&#39;s success in gaming — the free-to-play phenomenon skews that. But even putting aside money as a measuring stick, it&#39;s clear that the iPhone is the premier mobile gaming platform. There are way more good iPhone-only games than Android-only ones. Are there any good Android exclusive games at all?</p><p> The question is: will Apple&#39;s XR platform be like the Mac and Apple TV, where gaming is an afterthought, or will it be like iOS? I wouldn&#39;t bet on the headset turning Apple into a top-tier platform for immersive VR games, but I wouldn&#39;t bet against it either. It&#39;s a chance to start fresh.</p><p> The opportunity is massive: PC and console gaming is considered more “serious” than mobile gaming not just because the games are bigger and the devices more powerful, but because you play them on bigger screens. Nintendo&#39;s Switch proves that — the Switch is way less powerful than any recent iPhone, but way more “serious” because you can play it on your TV. (And yes, of course, because Nintendo&#39;s first-party titles are unique and extraordinarily good.)</p><p> VR gaming has the potential to be far more immersive than anything you play on a TV or PC monitor. Someone will crack that nut eventually.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Matt Birchler on Apple and Gaming’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/birchler-apple-gaming">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Bally Sports Fails to Pay the San Diego Padres, Loses Broadcast Rights </title><link href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/37762861/diamond-sports-group-fails-pay-padres-loses-broadcast-rights" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uuj" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/bally-sports-stiffs-the-padres" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39979</id><published> 2023-05-31T18:17:33Z</published><updated> 2023-05-31T18:36:28Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alden Gonzalez, reporting for ESPN:</p><blockquote><p> Diamond Sports Group has decided not to pay the San Diego Padres their latest rights fee, a monumental development that will revert the team&#39;s broadcasting rights to Major League Baseball and establish precedent for an uncertain, rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p> Diamond, the Sinclair subsidiary that operates under the name Bally Sports, skipped its payment to the Padres a couple of weeks ago and had until the end of its grace period on Tuesday to make the team whole and maintain their long-term agreement. Choosing not to meant Tuesday&#39;s game against the Miami Marlins was the last Padres game under the Bally Sports umbrella.

<p>Alexandra S. Levine, reporting for Forbes:</p><blockquote><p> Over the past several years, thousands of TikTok creators and businesses around the world have given the company sensitive financial information — including their social security numbers and tax IDs — so that they can be paid by the platform. But unbeknownst to many of them, TikTok has stored that personal financial information on servers in China that are accessible by employees there, Forbes has learned.</p><p> TikTok uses various internal tools and databases from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance to manage payments to creators who earn money through the app, including many of its biggest stars in the United States and Europe. The same tools are used to pay outside vendors and small businesses working with TikTok. But a trove of records obtained by Forbes from multiple sources across different parts of the company reveals that highly sensitive financial and personal information about those prized users and third parties has been stored in China. The discovery also raises questions about whether employees who are not authorized to access that data have been able to. It draws on internal communications, audio recordings, videos, screenshots, documents marked “Privileged and Confidential,” and several people familiar with the matter.</p><p> In testimony before Congress earlier this year, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew claimed US user data has been stored on physical servers outside China. “American data has always been stored in Virginia and Singapore in the past, and access of this is on an as-required basis by our engineers globally,” he said under oath at a House hearing in March.</p></blockquote><p> TikTok should be banned in the United States, and Chew should be charged with perjury.

<p>Katherine Sayre, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AZg4sD5AdQ86ddbt456JLaw">News+</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Blackjack, a fast-paced card game, historically paid out a ratio of 3:2 when a player hit 21 on the first two cards. That means a gambler wins $15 for every $10 bet. Now, many blackjack tables on the Strip pay out at 6:5, which means that same $10 yields only $12.</p><p> John and Kristina Mehaffey, owners of gambling-news and data company Vegas Advantage, have been cataloging these changes since 2011, walking miles-long routes through casinos to record the number of blackjack and roulette tables set outside of VIP areas.</p><p> According to the Mehaffeys&#39; data, more than two-thirds of blackjack tables on the Strip currently offer 6:5 payouts, as opposed to 3:2.</p></blockquote><p> 6:5 blackjack should be illegal. I mean that. I don&#39;t understand what the gambling regulators in Nevada are doing that this is permissible. What I&#39;ve seen in recent years is that all of the lower-limit tables have 6:5 payouts, and to get real blackjack, with 3:2 payouts, you need to play at tables with $50 minimums, sometimes $100 on weekends.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> My own home state of Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/058/chapter633a/s633a.13.html&amp;d=reduce">mandates 3:2 blackjack payouts by law</a> .

<p>Heather Cox Richardson:</p><blockquote><p> Beginning in 1943, the War Department published a series of pamphlets for US Army personnel in the European theater of World War II. Titled <em>Army Talks</em> , the series was designed “to help [the personnel] become better-informed men and women and therefore better soldiers.” On March 24, 1945, the topic for the week was “FASCISM!” [...]</p><p> The War Department thought it was important for Americans to understand the tactics fascists would use to take power in the United States. They would try to gain power “under the guise of &#39;super-patriotism&#39; and &#39;super-Americanism.&#39;” And they would use three techniques:</p><p> First, they would pit religious, racial, and economic groups against one another to break down national unity. Part of that effort to divide and conquer would be a “well-planned &#39;hate campaign&#39; against minority races, religions, and other groups.”</p><p> Second, they would deny any need for international cooperation, because that would fly in the face of their insistence that their supporters were better than everyone else. “In place of international cooperation, the fascists seek to substitute a perverted sort of ultra-nationalism which tells their people that they are the only people in the world who count. With this goes hatred and suspicion toward the people of all other nations.”</p><p> Third, fascists would insist that “the world has but two choices — either fascism or communism, and they label as &#39;communists&#39; everyone who refuses to support them.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s downright spooky how this pamphlet from 80 years ago describes <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-fbi-justice-department-purge-1234743318/">Trumpism</a> and the MAGA movement to a T. <a href="https://archive.org/details/ArmyTalkOrientationFactSheet64-Fascism/mode/2up">Here&#39;s the original pamphlet</a> .

<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> If mindlessly browsing the internet is your preferred way to combat boredom and waste time, the indie app makers behind to-do list app Clear and game Heads Up have a new product you&#39;ll want to try: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6448401688">Web Roulette</a> , a mobile web browser app for iOS built for the short attention spans of the TikTok era. With the debut version out now, you can add your favorite websites or choose from its suggestions, then swipe through the sites to see what&#39;s new or shake the app for a surprise webpage when boredom strikes.</p><p> The team says the idea initially struck them as something of a joke. But they soon realized the idea of a &#39;swipeable,&#39; shakable web browser that delivered our daily hits of dopamine may actually have merit.</p><p> “I mean, this is actually how I spend much of my time browsing the web — I bounce back and forth mindlessly and semi-randomly between my favorite sites, hoping for something fresh. Maybe there&#39;s something here?,” explains Impending founder and designer Phill Ryu.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been beta testing Web Roulette for a week or two and it&#39;s just plain dumb fun. In the early days of the App Store (and before that, the early days of the web), it was common for people to come up with a dumb fun idea that could be made in a week or two. Web Roulette exemplifies that ethos. It&#39;s not useful, per se, but it&#39;s not use <em>less</em> either. But it&#39;s mainly just fun.

<p>Adam Engst, writing at TidBITS:</p><blockquote><p> Where Mimestream shines is in its attention to visual form and functional detail — the small interface elements and features that make working with email feel familiar, fluid, and fast. I spend hours per day in email, and while I&#39;m willing to tweak my working habits slightly to match what an app can do, I prefer it to accommodate my idiosyncrasies.</p><p> For instance, I seldom delete messages. My Google account has plenty of space, and Gmail&#39;s performance doesn&#39;t degrade with massive email stores, so I prefer to keep everything for posterity and focus my attention on unread and starred messages. So it&#39;s vital that my email client supports that approach rather than pushing its own concept of Inbox Zero or whatever philosophy it might have.</p><p> I can&#39;t predict what refinements and affordances will make working with your email a joy, so I want to share some of what I find compelling about Mimestream.

The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple&#39;s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we&#39;re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it&#39;s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that&#39;s an easy announcement: it&#39;s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it&#39;s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850">Last year&#39;s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos">here&#39;s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p><p> But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There&#39;s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn&#39;t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn&#39;t. They might have ideally wanted to announce it <em>before</em> this year&#39;s WWDC at a special event, but if they want developers to start creating software for the platform, this is the time. (And why wouldn&#39;t they want developers to start working on ideas?)</p><p> Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p><p> Here&#39;s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren&#39;t just pre-recorded, they&#39;re very tightly edited. I suspect we&#39;ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It&#39;ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem with the new “keynote movie” format. <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-19">1</a></sup> We won&#39;t come out of the keynote thinking it was too long; we&#39;ll come out of it with our heads spinning because it&#39;s going to cover so much, so fast.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-19"><p> And if I&#39;m right, I bet this is one of those years where after the keynote is over, and people start poring over everything Apple puts on the web, we discover a surprising number of very cool iOS and MacOS features that didn&#39;t make it into the keynote. Anything and everything from the OSes might get cut to make time for the headset, xrOS, and Mac hardware announcements. There&#39;s a whole second State of the Union technical keynote in the afternoon where features cut from the main morning keynote can go. <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回正文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ On Apple Fitting a Headset Announcement Into the Always-Packed WWDC Keynote </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/do_wall_street_journal_reporters_read_the_wall_street_journal" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/ut6" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39930</id><published> 2023-05-19T01:41:49Z</published><updated> 2023-05-20T00:34:04Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> In a sense, Apple *does* have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make the first one good enough to be criticized. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie, reporting last week for The Wall Street Journal, “ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-is-breaking-its-own-rules-with-a-new-headset-80c9b36c">Apple Is Breaking Its Own Rules With a New Headset</a> ” ( <a href="https://apple.news/AdSGSL1h8RBa5WioRJe_T9g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s launch plans break many of its traditions and rules about new products that have become the industry gold standard. Unlike other Apple products, the device is debuting in a still-experimental mode. Apple predicts slower adoption for the headset compared with the Apple Watch or the iPhone, both of which quickly became consumer must-haves. Taking seven years in development before hitting the market, it will be one of the most complex consumer products any company has ever sold.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a lot to unpack in one paragraph. Here goes:</p><p> I&#39;d argue Apple has never introduced two new products the same way. Every new product introduction has been different. I honestly don&#39;t know any more about the headset than the rumor mill consensus but I guarantee it isn&#39;t in an “experimental mode”. Neither Apple Watch nor iPhone “quickly became consumer must-haves”. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">Here&#39;s a report from Daisuke Wakabayashi</a> in ... <em>checks notes</em> ... The Wall Street Fucking Journal itself in April 2016, a year after Apple Watch shipped, that says, in the opening paragraph, “Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple&#39;s most popular devices: disappointment.” (The next paragraph claimed that “sales of iPhones are slowing”.) <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-18"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-18">1</a></sup></p><p> The pattern for Apple&#39;s entries into new product categories generally goes like this:</p><ul><li> Apple releases the first version. It&#39;s expensive. It&#39;s missing a few obvious features. It has a few obvious limitations. But it&#39;s a breakthrough.</li><li> Early adopters wait in line outside Apple Stores overnight to buy it. Online sales are backordered by weeks or even months soon after they launch.</li><li> That early fervor aside, it&#39;s an early adopter product, and sales are less than those of Apple&#39;s established products.</li><li> After a few months or maybe a year, the immediate-gratification-obsessed business press runs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">articles</a> declaring the product a dud.</li><li> Apple releases a second-gen version that&#39;s better. Sales go up. Word continues to spread.</li><li> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">With each successive year</a> , Apple releases improved models. Those obvious missing features are added. The obvious limitations are removed. Older models stay on sale at lower price points. It becomes a hit product.</li><li> Years later, when Apple is poised to release another altogether new product, the last one — the one written off as a dud after its first year — is held up as a product that was universally hailed as a sensation and smash hit from day one.</li></ul><p> A few paragraphs later in Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie&#39;s report:</p><blockquote><p> For Apple&#39;s first new major product in a decade — the Apple Watch was announced in 2014 — Chief Executive Tim Cook has a lot on the line as the device attempts to dominate the virtual world where people spend time for work or leisure, called the metaverse, which hasn&#39;t yet reached mass adoption or understanding.</p><p> There is growing skepticism among some investors and potential future partners that consumers will spend money and time on the metaverse. They note some early adopters are disillusioned with the technology.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s a sidenote perhaps, but I&#39;d argue that AirPods are a major new product — and that AirPods Pro are the first true mass-market augmented reality devices. The fact that they&#39;re audio-only, and not visual, blinds people (sorry) to the fact that they&#39;re <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/10/airpods_pro_first_impressions">remarkable AR products</a> . Apple doesn&#39;t break out unit sales, but estimates suggest that if AirPods — just AirPods — were a standalone company, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">it would have more revenue</a> than Nvidia, Adobe, or Uber, and might soon catch up to Netflix. But that&#39;s a sidenote.</p><p> The bigger issue is that back in October, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/26/stern-federighi-joz">in an on-stage interview</a> , Greg Joswiak was asked to complete the sentence “The metaverse is...”, and his answer was, “...a word I&#39;ll never use.” The fact that people don&#39;t use or even know what the hell the metaverse means is irrelevant to Apple&#39;s headset. I don&#39;t know how much more clear Joz could have been without revealing Apple&#39;s headset then and there — <em>Apple&#39;s not making something that&#39;s just like what other companies already have on the market</em> . That on-stage interview was with ... <em>checks notes</em> ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ugwoEOMvg">Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference</a> . It&#39;s enough to make you think Wall Street Journal reporters don&#39;t read The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> That no XR headset introduced so far has made much of a dent in the universe isn&#39;t a sign that Apple&#39;s effort is ill-fated. It&#39;s a sign that Apple has an opportunity. In a sense, Apple <em>does</em> have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">the first one good enough to be criticized</a> .</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-18"><p> Here&#39;s a paragraph for the Annals of Prognostication from that same 2016 Wakabayashi report for the Journal:</p><blockquote><p> And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a “flop.” Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn&#39;t be a “home run” like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn&#39;t want to wear a computer on their wrist.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/fred-wilson-predictions">Fred Wilson</a> , the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/05/wilson">next best thing</a> to <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/10/cnbcs-jim-cramer-touted-silicon-valley-bank-stock/">Jim Cramer</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回正文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Do Wall Street Journal Reporters Read The Wall Street Journal? </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/lets_check_in_on_supermicro" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/ut4" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39928</id><published> 2023-05-18T21:19:24Z</published><updated> 2023-05-18T22:17:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> What a nice postscript to a disgraceful story. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/gm-hires-ex-apple-exec-mike-abbott-to-lead-new-software-unit.html">Michael Wayland, reporting last week for CNBC</a> :</p><blockquote><p> General Motors has hired former Apple executive Mike Abbott to lead a newly created software unit for the Detroit automaker. Abbott, former vice president of engineering for Apple&#39;s cloud services division, will join GM as executive vice president of software, effective May 22. He will report to GM CEO Mary Barra.</p><p> Abbott&#39;s newly created role will bring together three separate functions within the company: software-defined vehicle and operating systems; information and digital technology; and the company&#39;s digital business. [...]</p><p> GM has a target to grow profit margins and double its revenue to about $280 billion by the end of this decade. That includes significant growth in new business units and software.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m not familiar with Mike Abbott, but it sounds like his expertise is entirely in cloud services, not user-facing software design and engineering. So I don&#39;t think Barra was thinking “ <em>Apple makes great software that people love, so we should hire someone from Apple who knows how to lead such a team</em> ”, <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-16"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-16">1</a></sup> but instead more like “ <em>Apple has built an $80 billion per year services division that continues to grow each quarter, so we should hire someone who knows how to lead such a team</em> ”. Barra is looking at <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/05/apple-q2-2023-results-94-8b-revenue-better-than-expected/">Apple&#39;s services revenue</a> , not the quality of Apple&#39;s CarPlay.</p><p> That&#39;s fine, and maybe someone like Abbott is exactly who GM needs. But I don&#39;t look at this hire and think that GM is any more likely to come up with a CarPlay-quality interface for its own platform. Some back-of-the-envelope math on Barra&#39;s services revenue goals for GM makes it sound to me like Mike Abbott is being tasked with designing an in-dash slot machine.</p><p> When <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/gm_carplay_iphones">GM announced they were dropping CarPlay from their EVs</a> last month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/gm-plans-phase-out-apple-carplay-evs-with-googles-help-2023-03-31/">Reuters reported</a> that “Barra is aiming for $20 billion to $25 billion in annual revenue from subscriptions by 2030.”</p><p> That seems very ambitious.</p><p> Let&#39;s look at GM&#39;s current subscription services revenue. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/07/24/why-wall-street-loves-this-new-car-option-that-dri/">Here&#39;s Larry Printz, writing for Motley Fool last July</a> :</p><blockquote><p> According to company officials, GM generated nearly $2 billion in subscription services revenue and EBIT margins north of 70% in fiscal 2021. The automaker currently has more than 4 million subscribers. For 2021, GM&#39;s global revenue was $127 billion, meaning that if forecast proved true, OnStar accounted for 1.6% of GM&#39;s worldwide revenue. While that may seem like a minimal contribution to the bottom line, that figure should grow thanks to recent additions to OnStar.</p><p> GM recently announced a subscription plan for its SuperCruise self-driving feature, which is free for the first three years on new vehicles. It also opened OnStar to owners of non-GM vehicles through a smartphone app, which should bring additional subscribers — and income.</p></blockquote><p> To grow from $2 billion to $20 billion (the low end of Barra&#39;s stated goal) by 2030, it seems safe to assume she&#39;s expecting this growth to come from future car sales, not GM vehicles that are already on the road today.</p><p> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/225326/amount-of-cars-sold-by-general-motors-worldwide/">GM sells about 6 million vehicles per year</a> — but that number has been declining since a peak of 10 million in 2016. Presumably, these future services will require vehicles equipped with GM&#39;s new software platform. Right now they&#39;re claiming this system will only be going into EVs, and in 2022, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/629611/us-gm-plugin-car-sales-2022q4/">only 1.7 percent of GM vehicles sold were all-electric</a> .</p><p> So let&#39;s be generous and say that by 2030, GM has sold 30 million vehicles eligible for <em>and subscribed to</em> the company&#39;s new services. I think 30 million is very generous — if not outlandish — and would require them to put the new software platform in their gas and hybrid vehicles, too. Keep in mind they only had 4 million subscribers in 2021 and their vehicle sales are in decline.</p><p> $20 billion in revenue from 30 million subscribers = $666/year/vehicle = $55/month/vehicle. That&#39;s in line with their current average of $500/year per services subscriber ($2 billion in revenue from 4 million subscribers, per Motley Fool above), but it&#39;s a lot of money per subscriber. I just don&#39;t see how they grow from 4 million subscribers today to 30 million or more by 2030.</p><p> What services could they offer that new car buyers would pay north of $50/month for? Maps and navigation? Everyone has that on their phones already. Music and podcasts? Everyone has that on their phones already. Crash detection? By 2030 everyone will have that on their phones already (or at least they will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213225">if they have iPhones</a> , but I bet that will soon become a standard feature on Android phones too). GM wants to sell “behavior based insurance” (translation: tracking/surveillance), but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-set-launch-behavior-based-us-driver-insurance-q1-executive-2022-01-24/">according to Reuters</a> , their goal for insurance is just $6 billion/year by 2030. I find it hard to see where the rest of the money will come from.</p><p> GM executives might be dreaming that car buyers will pay GM for services they already get on their phones by not supporting CarPlay and Android Auto, but today&#39;s reality shows that people will just buy $5 mounts to attach their phones to their vehicles&#39; dashboards. And if every other automaker continues to support CarPlay and Android Auto, it just seems like this entire endeavor will turn into an expensive boondoggle that steers would-be GM buyers to other brands.</p><p> One idea that occurred to me is the equivalent of Apple&#39;s services revenue dark matter: payments from Google for default placement as Safari&#39;s search engine. Neither Apple nor Google has ever disclosed those numbers, but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/05/apple-default-search-engine/">one recent estimate</a> pegs it at $20 billion per year. At a minimum, it&#39;s $10 billion per year. Those payments from Google go into “Services” in Apple&#39;s quarterly results. Apple now reports $20 billion in services revenue per <em>quarter</em> — so most of that is coming from the App Store, and then customer subscriptions to things like iCloud Plus, Apple Music, etc., but somewhere around 20-25 percent of it comes from Google paying to be the default search engine in Safari. With GM&#39;s upcoming in-house software system not supporting CarPlay or Android Auto, but made in partnership with Google (based on Google&#39;s confusingly-named <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive">Android Automotive</a> platform) presumably Google Maps (and/or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499734/google-maps-waze-development-teams-combined-productivity">Waze</a> ?) will be the one and only choice for mapping and navigation, and perhaps Google will pay GM for that privilege? And for default placement for other services like music? Even if that&#39;s the deal, though, I don&#39;t see how it gets GM close to $20 billion in services revenue per year. Apple gets $15-20 billion from Google for default search engine placement in Safari on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021">over one billion</a> iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Even my kindest, most optimistic estimate pegs eligible GM vehicles at just 30 million by 2030. Would Google pay GM 30–40 times more per car to provide the default mapping app than they pay Apple per iPhone/iPad/Mac? That doesn&#39;t make sense to me, but I suppose it&#39;s theoretically possible that mapping surveillance data is <em>that</em> valuable to Google. I really fucking doubt it, though.</p><p> The one and only thing I can think of that GM can charge a subscription for that drivers can&#39;t get via their phones is semi-autonomous driving. GM calls this Super Cruise and <a href="https://www.onstar.com/plans/premium">currently charges $25/month for it</a> , or $15/month for drivers who also subscribe to OnStar. (OnStar offers roadside assistance and crash detection — which, again, everyone will have for free with their phones by 2030.) But Super Cruise could exist as a standalone subscription feature <em>alongside</em> support for CarPlay and Android Auto — and in fact does today. Charging a subscription fee for Super Cruise doesn&#39;t require GM to drop support for CarPlay and Android Auto integration.</p><p> I can&#39;t see how these ballpark numbers make any sense. It&#39;s an enormous bet against the primacy of the phone in people&#39;s lives, with no one yet, in any industry, ever having won a bet against the phone. GM&#39;s $20–25 billion target for services revenue by 2030 feels like a <a href="https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Kendall_Roy">Kendall Roy number</a> — plucked out of thin air by someone just making up figures in an Excel spreadsheet until they get the <code>SUM()</code> result they&#39;re looking for.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-16"><p> I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any chance whatsoever this could have happened, but imagine if GM had hired Scott Forstall to lead their software division.
