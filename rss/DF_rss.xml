<p>乔·罗森斯特（Joe Rosensteel）：</p><blockquote><p> Netflix深感遗憾地意外地使Netflix成为其客户更好的产品。 It temporarily pushed out a change that let people <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/have-apple-and-netflix-finally-made-an-apple-tv-deal/">see Netflix shows in the Apple TV app</a> , a change people have been asking for since the debut of the Apple TV app in 2016 with its Up Next queue and content aggregation features. Fortunately, Netflix swiftly corrected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">the error</a> before too many of its users could experience anything approaching joy, or satisfaction with Netflix.客户绝对应该放弃这个问题，而不是按Netflix打开肯定会重新存在的功能。</p></blockquote><p>我明白了为什么Netflix坚持使用该枪支，但它们在错误的一面。 Apple TV users were overjoyed yesterday when the Netflix app briefly started integrating with the TV app for “what next”, etc. Steven Aquino described it as “ <a href="https://www.curbcuts.co/blog/apple-and-netflix-must-do-right-and-finally-make-tv-app-peace-for-accessibilitys-sake">jubilance</a> ”.</p><p> Netflix用户只有一个小子集（也许是Netflix的Grant Global Scare，Dertright Minuscule）使用Apple TV硬件。但是我们当中那些这样做的人是因为我们喜欢它。大多数人认为“为什么还要为另一个框架连接额外支付，又是另一个遥控器，还有另一件事要学习，当Netflix和其他大多数流行的流媒体服务刚刚在我的电视上建造时？” Apple TV用户竭尽全力购买额外的盒子（并不便宜），因为他们的品味良好，并且想要在所有方面都具有优越性的体验：从技术上讲，在UI方面和隐私方面。</p><p>因此，Netflix拒绝采用良好的TVOS公民身份的惯用惯例令人失望，这不仅是随机的一小部分用户，而且出于充分的理由，最关心的用户的子集。 Or, as MG Siegler put it <a href="https://spyglass.org/netflix-apple-tv/#update">when he updated his post</a> after it turned out this was a rug pull, “Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck. Do these fucking idiots know how stupid this looks and <em>is</em> ?”</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“ Netflix深深地遗憾地使Netflix成为客户的更好产品”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/netflix-apple-tv-integration-oopsie">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>钥匙代码2.2.2 </title><link href="https://manytricks.com/keycodes/help/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/key-codes-2-2-2" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41577</id><published> 2025-02-15T17：08：29Z</published><updated> 2025-02-15T17：08：29Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Wikitok是Isaac Gemal的创建。前提是，这是Wikipedia随机文章的Tiktok风格界面。一件事一次在屏幕上，在准备就绪时向下滑动以向下滚动到下一个物品，如果需要，您可以永远继续前进。但是，这些是事实，而不是倾向于无意识的媒体热卡路里的视频。 Wikitok根本没有视频 - 每个项目只是全出来的图像，也是一个摘要的事实。 （当然，还有一个“阅读更多”链接，可以在新的浏览器选项卡中打开Wikipedia的完整条目。）它不会在订婚时击败实际的Tiktok，但Tiktok无法击败Wikitok的精神滋养。这就像选择在不是垃圾的东西上零食。</p><p> Wikitok在任何尺寸的设备上都可以使用，但是像Tiktok一样，它显然是在手机上使用的。将其保存到主屏幕上，就像拥有应用程序一样。在NFL赛季和March Madness（在那之后，棒球之后）之间的这个中期期间，我从Apple Sports的第一个主屏幕上释放了一个空间，目前，我将Wikitok放在那里。我不知道它会持续多久。实际上我感兴趣的事情的“命中率”有点低 - 但也许这就是Tiktok本身的样子？而且，每次启动它时，我都会在几次滑动中学习一些有趣的东西。没有算法可以为它显示的内容提供动力，但是我希望有 - 我会心跳转向一块Wikitok的叉子，这些Wikitok学习了，甚至只有一点，实际上是什么样的东西让我感兴趣。尝试一下。鉴于检查新闻的另一种经验，目前Wikitok的首次亮相似乎尤为恰当。</p><p>如果我只能弯曲Gemal的耳朵，我恳求他考虑将名字从Wikitok更改为Wiktok。那个不必要的中间<em>音节</em>引起了不一致的音符。说出您想要的Tiktok，但这是一个很棒的名字。 Verbally, <em>WikiTok</em> sounds like <em>WikiTalk</em> , which sounds like what Wikipedia editors might call the meta-discussion “Talk” pages for each entry. <em>WikTok</em> , on the other hand, works well both visually and verbally as a parallel to <em>TikTok</em> .</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“ Wikitok  - 带有Tiktok风格的界面的Web应用程序，用于探索随机Wikipedia文章”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/wikitok">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>艾莉森·约翰逊（Allison Johnson）评论三星Galaxy S25和S25 Plus：“令人难以置信的迭代” </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/johnson-samsung-galaxy-s25" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41567</id><published> 2025-02-12T20：10：13Z</published><updated> 2025-02-12T21：44：50Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>从苹果新闻编辑室档案室，Dateline“旧金山麦克沃尔德博览会 -  2000年1月5日”：</p><blockquote><p>苹果今天将其备受期待的互联网策略推出，引入了一种新的互联网服务，称为Itools。一个完全重新设计的Apple.com网站，其中包含IREVIEW和ICARDS；以及与Earthlink的多年合作伙伴关系和投资，用于互联网访问（请参阅相关版本）。</p><p> Itools是革命性的互联网服务新类别，它利用了Internet两端的苹果公司的独特技术 - 客户端的操作系统（MAC OS 9）和在Apple的Internet服务器（ITOOLS）上运行的服务软件。在Internet两端提供该软件为Apple提供了前所未有的能力，可以提供无法仅在Internet服务器上实施的服务。</p><p>苹果公司Iceo的史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）表示：“我们的新Ireview，Icards和革命性的ITools为Mac用户提供了令人惊叹的新方法，可以充分利用互联网。” “ Mac用户现在可以在Wintel用户只能梦想的互联网上做一些事情。”</p></blockquote><p>事后看来，这令人震惊的是，苹果大约在2000年毫不掩饰地是笨拙的弱者。如果非常高度期待公告，您不必将其描述为“备受期待的”。乔布斯引用了包括口语的“ Wintel”。</p><p>从功能列表中：</p><blockquote><p> Mac.com，由Apple运营的电子邮件服务。 Mac.com在Internet上为用户提供了一个独家地址，并与标准的POP电子邮件客户端一起使用，例如Outlook Express，Eudora和Netscape Communicator。 Mac.com用户可以轻松地设置自动答复，并将其电子邮件转发到其他电子邮件地址，并从简单的网页上为其Mac.com邮箱配置Outlook Express。</p></blockquote><p> So I misremembered the timeline of how I got into my bifurcated Apple Account situation <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">earlier today</a> (but I was correct in that post to be uncertain of the timeline). My @mac.com address did predate the debut of the iTunes Music Store, but I&#39;ve had it since iTools was announced in January 2000, not when .Mac (worst Apple name ever?) was announced in July 2002. ( <a href="https://mastodon.mit.edu/@Eggfreckles/113988325606848730">Thanks to Thomas Brand</a> for reminding me.)

In some sense that seems like an odd choice in hindsight, insofar as that&#39;s my “work” address, but at the time (even though Daring Fireball was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2002/08/baby_needs_a_new_pair_of_processors">less than a year old</a> ) it felt like my best “forever” email address. I felt very certain from the start I&#39;d be doing this forever.</p><p> I chose to use my DF email address for the iTunes Store in 2003 despite the fact that I had created my @mac.com email address in the summer of 2002 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/07/17Apple-Launches-Mac/">when Apple launched .Mac</a> — a few weeks <em>before</em> I launched Daring Fireball. I signed up for .Mac to get a good username, “just in case” (although I didn&#39;t score “gruber” — someone beat me to it, despite the fact that I signed up during or soon after the end of the keynote in which .Mac was announced), but I never anticipated using it much. But .Mac became MobileMe, MobileMe became iCloud, and iCloud now is one&#39;s primary Apple Account. 20 years ago it just wasn&#39;t clear at all that the .Mac account I created would be so central to being an Apple platform user for decades to come.</p><p> So fast forward to today, and I&#39;ve had <em>two</em> Apple Accounts on every device I use for the last 20-or-so years. One for “Media and Purchases” (my original iTunes account, using the @daringfireball.net address), and my primary Apple ID (the @mac.com address). All my purchases — all the music, books, apps, subscriptions, and thousands of dollars in movies that I&#39;ve purchased with that iTunes account over the years — are using an Apple Account that&#39;s <em>not</em> my iCloud account.</p><p> Apple has made this bifurcation work pretty well over the years, seemingly not just because many longstanding customers are in the same boat as me, but many Apple employees are themselves passengers on that boat. “Just make it so you can transfer purchases from a secondary old account to your primary one” sounds easy, conceptually, but apparently it was devilishly tricky under the hood.</p><p> But it seems Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117267">has figured it out and implemented a solution</a> . I&#39;ll wait and let others try this before I do ( <em>if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it</em> ), but if any of you try this, I&#39;m curious how it goes — especially if you&#39;re part of a family sharing group.</p><p> ( <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/113987244286363899">Via Chris Espinosa</a> , who I suppose counts as both a longstanding employee <em>and</em> customer.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Support: ‘About Migrating Apple Account Purchases Between Accounts’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;The Wild True Story Behind Kendrick Lamar&#39;s Super Bowl Halftime Show&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/wired-kendrick-lamar-halftime-show" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41562</id><published> 2025-02-11T22:51:02Z</published><updated> 2025-02-11T22:51:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Angela Watercutter, with a great behind-the-scenes look at the Apple-Music-sponsored halftime show by Kendrick Lamar:</p><blockquote><p> While “making it work” means one thing when you&#39;re putting on a Madonna concert or the Democratic National Convention, it means something different when you&#39;re trying to squeeze it into a national title match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles 。 For one, you have to get all of the staging, lights, dancers, and the artist themselves onto the field in 7.5 minutes and then get them off 6 minutes after the final note. For another, you have to do all of this on a field where the biggest NFL game of the year is being played — without screwing up the turf.</p></blockquote><p> It seems like a great ongoing relationship for Apple Music to sponsor these halftime shows. Amazon Prime has Thursday Night Football, and Google&#39;s YouTube TV has the NFL Sunday Ticket package (which Apple seriously bid for, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4024544/2022/12/21/nfl-sunday-ticket-apple-youtube/">but didn&#39;t get</a> ). That leaves Apple TV+ as the biggest streaming platform from a big tech company that doesn&#39;t have any NFL games. Sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show gives the NFL a relationship with Apple.</p><p> And Apple seems happy to let the shows themselves be artist-centric. This was Kendrick Lamar&#39;s show, presented by Apple Music — not Apple Music&#39;s show featuring Kendrick Lamar. I could be wrong, but I think the old Pepsi halftime shows were more Pepsi-centric, more focused on spectacle than showmanship. There were some small lyrical adjustments, but those might have been at the NFL&#39;s behest more than Apple&#39;s.

<p>A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_bug">scorebug</a></em> is industry jargon for the sub-genre of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chyron">chyron</a> (itself jargon) that shows ever-present information about a televised sporting event while you&#39;re watching. These graphics display the teams, the score, the time remaining, and other metadata pertaining to the current situation. The current ball/strike count in baseball. The down and yards-to-go in football.篮球中的射门钟。那种事情。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-10">1</a></sup></p><p> Fox was the broadcast network for Super Bowl 59 yesterday, in which the Philadelphia Eagles utterly embarrassed the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 (but which felt like a score of 114-0). The NFL rotates the Super Bowl annually between the networks that broadcast games. Fox has a tradition of unveiling updated on-screen graphics packages when it has the Super Bowl.今年，他们不仅调整了设计，还完全重新考虑了设计并重新设计了它。</p><p> First, here&#39;s Fox&#39;s familiar old scorebug, as captured from their broadcast of Super Bowl 57, a game that <em>also</em> pitted the Eagles against the Chiefs two years ago. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-10">2</a></sup></p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-old-2160.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

  /></a></p><p>我立即注意到（当然），我的膝盖即时反应是负面的。 <em>Too big, too bold, too different. Don&#39;t like.</em>那很自然。 Human beings evolved to be alarmed by change. If everything looks the same as usual, everything is probably as safe as usual.如果某种东西看起来差异很大，那可能是您即将被杀死的标志。 （从进化上讲。）</p><p> So I started studying and <em>considering</em> the changes to Fox&#39;s scorebug. I quickly not only warmed up to the new scorebug, I decided I <em>really</em> like it.它比福克斯的旧网络好，比其他每个网络都更好（在几乎每一个方面看起来都一样）。</p><p>我（Cross-）在游戏期间非常喜欢新的Scorebug。 My posts, in order of engagement: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">Threads</a> (~6,600 likes, ~700 replies and reposts), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">Bluesky</a> (~3,900 likes, ~600 replies and reposts), and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">Mastodon</a> (179 likes, 53 replies and reposts).</p><p>与更改应用程序的图标相比，应用程序开发人员可以做出的任何更改都不会产生用户更多的评论和情感反馈。 Everyone sees an app&#39;s icon, and has an opinion about them.经过改变后，这种观点通常是“<em>我喜欢旧的图标，讨厌新的图标。</em>同样，随着游戏广播的得分刺激 - 每个人都看到了它们，并且每个人都会改变时都有意见。 Most reactions to Fox&#39;s new scorebug were negative, and many of those were <em>really</em> negative. Yahoo Sports在标题“ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">超级碗：Fox Sports首次亮相新的Scorebug，普遍负面反应</a>”的标题下播放了一个故事。以体育媒体为中心的网站糟糕地宣布了德鲁·勒纳（Drew Lerner）在标题下的“ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">请在超级碗期间首次亮相新的得分俱乐部</a>”（副标题：“我不能只看一个超级碗而不必学习新图形吗？” ）。我什至没有接近阅读我社交媒体的所有答复（嗯，除了在Mastodon上 - 很快就可以赶上那里），但是如果您仔细阅读它们，您会很快看到大多数答复来自people who despise the change.代表品尝：</p><p> “ <em>It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn&#39;t bother having someone check it first.可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “ <em>Lol. Muted for being a dumbass.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>It&#39;s hideous, and its overbearing size distracts from the actual content of the game.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don&#39;t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.</em>透明</p><p>“Looks like something out of Fortnite” isn&#39;t the dis the last commenter thinks it is.很多人玩耍和爱Fortnite。</p><p> Here&#39;s an expanded (from what I posted to social media) version of why I like, perhaps even love, the new scorebug. First, the primary items: who&#39;s playing and what&#39;s the score:</p><ul><li> <em>Team initialisms</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Team logos</em> : None. Colors say enough.</li><li> <em>Score</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Game clock</em> : Big enough and centered.</li><li> <em>Needless chrome</em> : None.</li></ul><p> Every team in the league is known by fans by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation of its home location, sort of like airport codes or stock tickers. They&#39;re all obvious ( <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">unlike many</a> airport codes). The Dallas Cowboys are DAL. The New England Patriots are NE. For the two cities which have two teams, New York and Los Angeles, the cities conveniently abbreviate to two letters and a third letter is drawn from the team nicknames: the Giants and Jets are NYG and NYJ; the Rams and Chargers are LAR and LAC.</p><p>团队徽标并不能立即识别，尤其是在小尺寸的情况下。 A bunch of teams have angry bird mascots: Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Cardinals.您还记得田纳西泰坦的徽标吗？ Or the Houston Texans&#39;? The Cleveland Browns don&#39;t even have a logo to speak of. （而且它们也不是棕色。）但是我保证您知道哪些球队是十，侯和CLE。 <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p> And, importantly, these team initialisms are not represented by typography alone: they are in a box with the team&#39;s primary color. That use of color does all the branding work necessary, and does it more effectively, at small sizes or viewed from far distances, than the team logos. (One small niggle I have is that the team initialisms are big white letters but are outlined by the team&#39;s secondary color. If you look closely at my screen capture from yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl above, you&#39;ll see that “KC” is outlined in yellow and “PHI” in silver. This has the effect, at a normal viewing distance, of making the initialisms look a little fuzzy. The secondary color outlines are too subtle to have their intended effect of further branding the teams, and instead have the unintended使文字在屏幕上呈现不佳的效果。</p><p> The elimination of all needless chrome is arguably the most striking change of all, because Fox&#39;s old scorebug had the most chrome with the most superfluous “3D” styling and textures.本身本身不是极简主义，但这是反对不必要的装饰的罢工 - 让我想起了乔尼·艾夫（Jony Ive）十年前7月7日的iOS重新设计。 Elements that can be conveyed by type and color alone <em>are</em> expressed by type and color alone.</p><p> Other noteworthy features:</p><ul><li><p><em>剩下的超时</em>：突出但不会分散注意力。看到一支球队剩下的超时是福克斯的旧得分捕食和大多数其他网络当前的得分cugs的巨大问题。 (Remaining timeouts are very important in close football games.)</p></li><li><p> <em>Current down and yards to go indicator (eg “1st &amp; 10”)</em> : Placement atop the team initialism conveys which team has the ball.福克斯（Fox）的旧得分俱乐部确实有一个“拥有”指标，但是滚动回头查看它，看看您需要多长时间才能弄清楚它是什么。 I&#39;ll put the answer in a footnote. <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p><em>排版</em>：经典，清晰，大胆，永恒。它也非常“狐狸”  - “ kc”中的c在经典的“福克斯”文字中看起来像o，而零（数字酋长球迷一直非常熟悉到第三季度的最后一秒钟，因为这就是方式many points they&#39;d scored until then — the Eagles cycled through a bunch of different digits en route to taking a 34-0 lead) looks pretty much exactly like the uppercase o in “FOX”.</p></li></ul><p>更大，更大胆的版式增加了清晰度。 But removing the background chrome lets viewers “see through” to any game action that happens at the bottom of the screen. To me, after just one game, the old Fox scorebug looks hopelessly dated; old-fashioned without any nostalgic charm. If anything, the new typography-first design is the one that looks timeless, evocative of the graphics from classic NFL Films productions.</p><hr /><p>这是什么。 NFL广播并不总是有分数。 I don&#39;t mean that they had smaller score indicators on screen. I mean they had none at all. This was true for all major sports on TV, not just football (eg the premise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">this gag from <em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a> ). Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials. But while the game played, there was no score on screen. Part of that is technology: game telecasts were low-fidelity over-the-air transmissions to relatively small TV screens that were viewed from across the room.回去足够远，甚至没有颜色。 But a bigger aspect is inertia. Not showing the score at all times was the way games were always broadcast, so it was the way they were still broadcast.</p><p>然后是福克斯。</p><p>几十年来，美国有三个主要的电视网络：ABC，NBC和CBS。 CBS had the Sunday game rights to the superior National Football Conference. “Superior” for the related reasons of team popularity <em>and</em> <a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">team market size</a> , which matters for ratings. Chicago, Philly, Washington, Dallas, Frisco. NBC had the Sunday game rights for the American Football Conference with teams from generally smaller cities.堪萨斯城匹兹堡，迈阿密。 Good teams, but smaller cities. (In 1993, though, NFC teams had won 9 consecutive Super Bowls.)</p><p> Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox network was an attempt — soon enough proven successful — to establish a fourth US network. At the time of their debut in 1987, Fox only had prime time programming on one night a week (Sundays, conveniently). 1993年，默多克和福克斯（Murdoch）和福克斯（Fox）通过超越（愚蠢的，紧身，狂热，狂热）的哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）宣传体育广播的世界，以便在周日播放NFC游戏的权利。</p><p> In 2018, Bryan Curtis published at The Ringer a comprehensive oral history of the deal and its consequences: “ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever</a> ”. If this sort of thing interests you at all, read that.讲得很好，这是一个很棒的故事。</p><p> But so in 1994 Fox took over the NFC broadcasts. They poached from CBS all the announcers, cameramen, directors, and producers. (CBS didn&#39;t need them anymore, because they had no football games to broadcast.) But while the voices announcing the game were familiar (including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">the best duo ever to do it</a> : John Madden and Pat Summerall), the look and feel of the broadcasts was intentionally new and fresh and, well, because it was Fox, brash. This included an innovation they called the “Fox Box”.引用柯蒂斯在铃声中的口述历史：</p><blockquote><p> <em>David Hill&#39;s most controversial idea about the NFL was his simplest: He thought the score and clock should have a permanent home on the screen — a feature that became known as the “Fox Box.”一群嘈杂的批评家和竞争对手的高管认为狐狸盒是一个可怕的主意。它会使屏幕混乱，并使人们摆脱井喷。 But Hill was convinced, because he&#39;d created a proto–Fox Box after a frustrating afternoon watching soccer in the UK</em></p><p> <strong>Hill:</strong> We&#39;d been out walking our dogs. We&#39;d come in, got a cup of tea, and switched the BBC on. I watched the game for a good 15 minutes.我不知道分数是多少。我对自己想：“该死，我真的很想知道分数是多少。”所以我想：“这很容易。在chyron上，我只是把它放在拐角处。”所以我做到了。</p><p> <strong>Madden:</strong> Instead of saying, “No, that&#39;s a stupid idea, we got other things we have to do,” he said, “If the score and the time is the most important thing, why don&#39;t we just put it up and留在那里吗？”那是狐狸盒的来源。那是大卫·希尔。</p><p> <strong>Dolgin:</strong> All the networks told us, “You&#39;re screwing this up. You&#39;re idiots to do this.”</p><p><strong>阿尔伯特（Albert）：</strong>这个想法是，有些网络不会离开时间并得分，因为这是一场井喷，他们不希望您<em>知道</em>这是一场井喷。</p></blockquote><p> “福克斯盒”的想法不仅有争议，而且被广泛愚蠢。 The networks literally thought it would be better if many viewers didn&#39;t know the score. And when the Fox Box appeared, many critics agreed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">Dan Cox&#39;s review of Fox&#39;s opening week broadcast for Variety</a> , in September 1994:</p><blockquote><p> The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game. Fox Sports prexy David Hill has said it&#39;s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.</p><p>好吧，是的。 But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p></blockquote><p> Who seems stupid now?想象一下，如果福克斯（Fox）播出了昨天的超级碗（Super Bowl），那就想象一下，因为那些宁愿避开屏幕的人，否则昨天的超级碗都没有任何得分刺。</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business.吸烟者想吸烟，如果不能的话，就会待在家里。 Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better.

<p>Well, the Philadelphia Eagles, of course, won the actual Super Bowl, winning in a romp so one-sided that they would have embarrassed the Chiefs <em>less</em> if they had pantsed Patrick Mahomes at the 50-yard line.但是第二个比赛是最佳广告。 And my vote goes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">to Nike</a> .</p><p> The problem with modern Super Bowl commercials is they&#39;re bland.进攻平淡。 It really makes no sense to me. The commercial time is famously expensive — Fox was supposedly selling 30-second spots for last night&#39;s game for $8 million — but the sponsors who buy that time tend to squander it with absolute mindless pap.</p><p> Fewer and fewer sponsors each year, it seems, attempt to bring something actually interesting.不同的东西。有些打孔的东西。 Something that&#39;s <em>actually</em> funny. Something that makes you actually <em>feel</em> . You don&#39;t have to make a genuinely artistic short film, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I">Apple&#39;s Ridley-Scott-directed <em>1984</em> spot</a> heralding the introduction of the Macintosh — the ad that is justifiably regarded as the best commercial ever made. Some of what I&#39;d list among the best Super Bowl ads ever were silly gimmicks that revelled in their abject silliness, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Bowl">the “Bud Bowl” commercials</a> (featuring anthropomorphic bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light playing football) — very far from “high art” but very fun, and created specifically to be shown once and only once, in the context of the Super Bowl.一种简单的措施是广告是否令人难忘。在昨晚的比赛中，大多数广告都忘记了比赛后游戏恢复的时候。</p><p> I don&#39;t know why anyone would book and commission a Super Bowl commercial if they weren&#39;t trying to <em>do</em> something or <em>say</em> something memorable with the spot. Still, though, there are always at least a handful of standouts.</p><p>我昨天最喜欢的是<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">耐克（Nike）的“ So Win”景点</a>，这是自己的预示 - 不是针对新的耐克产品，而是为了对女子运动的兴趣，以WNBA现象Caitlin Clark和其他一些顶级女运动员为特色。华丽的黑白摄影。 Led Zeppelin&#39;s rollicking “ <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whole-lotta-love/580708374?i=580708471">Whole Lotta Love</a> ” as the soundtrack. And a righteous manifesto of a message, delivered with pitch-perfect gusto by narrator Doechii. Nike, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/nikes-super-bowl-ad-puts-women-athletes-center-stage-on-a-male-dominated-field/">it turns out</a> , hadn&#39;t run a Super Bowl ad since 1998, and they came back with a banger that to me reinvigorated the Nike brand.他们已经<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/former-nike-ceo-john-donahoe-leadership-lessons-choosing-ceo/">有点自由跌倒了</a>，我认为该广告旨在激发耐克员工和对女运动员和体育迷的启发。 (Shades of Apple&#39;s “Think Different” campaign.) I&#39;ve re-watched this spot a few times while writing this post and I like it more each time.</p><p> Honorable mentions:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/608476/openai-super-bowl-chatgpt-commercial">ChatGPT&#39;s branding spot</a> , positioning AI alongside historical breakthroughs in technology.喜欢它。 I think it was supposed to be a mystery until the very end of the 60-second spot who the ad was for and what exactly it was about, but I guessed “ChatGPT” about 5 seconds in. I kind of hate making a third comparison to an old Apple ad, but ChatGPT&#39;s spot does evoke — not as a rip-off, but homage — the 90-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAEPqUtra6E">“There are a thousand no&#39;s for every yes” opening film from WWDC 2013</a> , perhaps the nadir of Apple&#39;s post-Steve-Jobs grief.</li><li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoeGC-eL4I">Stella Artois</a> : David Beckham learns that he has a twin brother, named Other David Beckham, whom his parents abandoned at birth in America. Beckham sets off to meet him. Don&#39;t read anything more about it, just watch. Good kicker at the end, too.</li></ul><p> Dishonorable mention:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi</a>是Fox拥有的流媒体平台。 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Apparently</a> it&#39;s existed since 2014 and has been owned by Fox since 2020, but I&#39;d forgotten it existed until this week, when it was in the news as the streaming platform carrying the Super Bowl. Fox ran a couple of house ads, intended to promote Tubi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMDrZDhxWBs">about a young man born with a head shaped like a cowboy hat</a> . Memorable, yes, but the execution was revolting, not funny. The message I took was that Tubi is the streaming app that will make you feel grossed out.</li></ul> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nike&#39;s &#39;So Win&#39; Won the Super Bowl</title></entry><entry><link href="https://go.clerk.com/2n40MWr" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2f" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/02/clerk_--_complete_user_managem" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41559</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-02-10T22:04:37Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T22：04：38Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Looks like more of an Eddy scene than a Tim scene, but everyone&#39;s having fun. There&#39;s a reason this is the 11th Super Bowl held in New Orleans.</p><p> Should be a good football game, too. The Chiefs and Eagles are both very good teams (and <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/chiefs-senior-vp-of-football-operations-on-why-brett-veach-is-a-hall-of-fame-gm">both</a> very <a href="https://www.wsj.com/sports/football/nfl-super-bowl-howie-roseman-philadelphia-eagles-7b5a906d">well-run</a> franchises). There&#39;s a strong case to be made that these are the two best teams in the NFL this season. And without question they&#39;re two of the top four (I&#39;d add the Bills and Ravens). If you&#39;re only a casual fan, you might think that happens every year. A championship game, ideally, would always feature two of the very best teams. But that&#39;s often <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199301310buf.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199401300buf.htm">the</a> <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201402020den.htm">way</a> it <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202102070tam.htm">works</a> out. This year it did. What&#39;s similar about both the Chiefs and Eagles is that both teams are full of surprises and tricks — they often do things no one would expect. But even more often, <em>they do exactly what everyone expects them to do</em> , the most predictable thing possible, and it just can&#39;t be stopped even when the other team knows it&#39;s coming.

<p>Zara Stone, reporting for The Standard:</p><blockquote><p> “There&#39;s a renaissance happening now in Aaron Swartz-land,” said Lisa Rein, the co-founder of Creative Commons, a nonprofit devoted to expanding public access to information. She founded Aaron Swartz Day in 2013, an annual hackathon and tribute held on his birthday. There&#39;s now an Aaron Swartz Institute in Brazil, a documentary, multiple books and podcasts — even an Aaron Swartz memecoin (“Do not buy,” she warned).</p></blockquote><p> Aaron, I know, would have laughed at that.</p><blockquote><p> Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Twitch and a partner at Y Combinator, was one of the few people who knew Swartz personally. “I&#39;m glad he&#39;s become a symbol, he would approve of that,” he shared, his voice slightly breaking. “我真的很想念他。”</p></blockquote><p>我也想念他。男人。 But I find it weird that there were only “few people who knew him” at the event. So many people knew him.这就是使亚伦·<em>亚伦</em>（Aaron Aaron）的一部分 - 他知道互联网上的每个人都很有趣。</p><p>我也不确定他会赞成所有这一切，他是一代从来不认识他的一代人的象征，只有他。 I don&#39;t think he&#39;d <em>disapprove</em> , either, because the folks holding him up as an icon — internet freedom and preservationist zealots — are, thankfully, aligned with Aaron&#39;s own righteous obsessions.但是我认为他会有些怪异。 He wasn&#39;t a “ <em>I hope they erect a larger-than-life statue of me</em> ” sort of guy.

<p>TikTok, on X:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re enhancing ways for our community to continue using TikTok by making Android Package Kits available at <a href="http://TikTok.com/download">http://TikTok.com/download</a> so that our US Android users can download our app and create, discover, and connect on TikTok.</p></blockquote><p>数以千计的用户直接从中国共产党直接到手机安装二进制文件 - 可能出了什么问题？</p><p> They also link to <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/getting-started/creating-an-account/download-tiktok">this support document</a> on their website, which includes these instructions for iOS:</p><blockquote><p>在iOS设备上访问tiktok：</p><ol><li> Go to www.tiktok.com/download.</li><li> Tap Add TikTok to Home Screen and follow the steps to create a shortcut to TikTok.com to the home screen on your device.</li></ol></blockquote><p>这是说“使用Web应用程序”的另一种方式，这实际上是安全的。我不知道他们是否总是拥有该应用程序的Web应用程序版本，还是他们在此僵局期间争先恐后地将其放在一起，但这还不错。 But it&#39;s got some very obvious layout glitches. (If you&#39;re a regular TikTok user, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on how this mobile web app compares to the actual native iOS app. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/contact/">Let me know</a> .)</p><p>我怀疑在这个对峙中会有一些东西。 Either (a) China relents and actually sells to a US company, and TikTok comes back to the App Store and Play Store; or (b) <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">Trump&#39;s extralegal extension</a> expires with no sale and Oracle and Akamai are forced to pull the plug on ByteDance&#39;s cloud services in the US.当然，另一个扩展是另一种可能性，但我认为像汤姆·棉花这样的共和党中国鹰在其中只有一个恩典时期。我们看看。</p><p> If I&#39;m wrong and TikTok remains in this half-zombie state in the US — unavailable in the App Store or Play Store, but operational if you have the app installed on your phone — it&#39;ll be interesting if TikTok is the app that使大众市场实际上关心iOS上缺乏侧载。 It&#39;ll be interesting too if sideloading on Android goes mainstream because of this.这可能是一个引人入胜的实验。 Apple的支持者允许iOS上的Mac风格软件分布，通常会争辩说，在技术上不熟练或精明的普通人 - 根本不会做到这一点，因为他们不在乎跳过篮球并单击警告关于侧层的风险。 But maybe TikTok is so popular it could break through.更不用说野兽可以利用Tiktok本身来算法来增强亲弹性视频的算法，甚至可以推动您关心Tiktok的趋势，您应该切换到Android。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘TikTok Is Now Distributing Its Android App for Installation via Sideloading’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/tiktok-android-sideloading">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>杰森·斯内尔（Jason Snell）去了那里，呼吁iOS遵循Mac模型进行软件分发</title><link href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2525708/the-app-store-era-must-end-apples-already-got-the-solution.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/snell-ios-direct-installation-of-apps" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41555</id><published> 2025-02-08T22:26:57Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T20：21：56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, in a column for Macworld back in November ( <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/the-app-store-era-must-end-and-the-mac-is-the-model/">same column at Six Colors</a> , for members):</p><blockquote><p>这是一个重要的时刻。 Apple has built two separate models for running software on our devices.在一个中，有一个可信赖的梯度，强烈鼓励用户坚持安全，光线充足的道路，但是允许竞争对手以自己的方式和用户做出与苹果公司所做的不同的决定。而且，是的，在极端情况下，用户可以以可能使他们面临危险的方式行为，但只有在许多警告之后。 It&#39;s a very good system. Apple built it that way because it cares about the Mac, the Mac ecosystem, and Mac users.</p><p>当然，另一个模型是我们从iOS中熟悉的模型：只有一层，苹果完全控制它。 Even though we&#39;re spending thousands of dollars to <em>own</em> devices that can run software developed by clever people from all over the world, Apple believes that only it should be able to determine what kinds of apps are allowed, that it should always be cut in on the revenue of every financial transaction inside those apps, and that if it doesn&#39;t like anything about a developer&#39;s app, it can demand it be changed or the app made to disappear into oblivion.</p><p>老实说，这两种方法都来自同一公司……有点惊人。 [...] I know which Apple-built approach should be the model for the future of software on computing devices. The good news is that Apple has already built it. The era of top-down control of our devices needs to end. Mac是模型。</p></blockquote><p>自从他写它以来，我一直在渴望链接到这一点，但是我在写一些漫长的东西或只是链接到它的渴望之间被撕裂了，并使我的评论简短。 Short it is, for now.我认为斯内尔没有错。 I know many — perhaps most? - 您读这本书与他一致。我敢肯定的是，如果iOS转移到Mac式的软件分发规则，我个人会以零缺陷的范围来享受它 - 我会从App Store访问以前无法从App Store中使用的软件（我们可以使<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/06/19/kotoba">Kotoba</a>简单下载，用于例如），由于App Store规则的存在，首先从未存在的新软件将存在，我很有信心我个人从来没有被欺骗或愚弄了即使安装一件我以后的软件come to regret. So if Apple were ever to follow Snell&#39;s advice — whether by a change of mind in Cupertino, or begrudgingly at the figurative gunpoint of government regulation — I would personally come out happier for it.你也可能会。</p><p> But I don&#39;t think Apple <em>should</em> do this, because I think there are tens of millions — maybe hundreds of millions — of iPhone users who would wind up installing apps they&#39;d come to regret having installed.

<p>Ashley Belanger, reporting for Ars Technica on new details from an authors group lawsuit alleging Meta trained its AI models on a trove of pirated books:</p><blockquote><p>上个月，梅塔承认洪流了一个有争议的大型数据集，称为Libgen，其中包括数千万的盗版书籍。但是，直到昨天，洪流的细节都是模糊的，直到梅塔未编辑的电子邮件首次公开。 The new evidence showed that Meta torrented “at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries through the site Anna&#39;s Archive, including at least 35.7 terabytes of data from Z-Library and LibGen,” the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Relief-2-5-25.pdf">authors&#39; court filing</a> said.

<p>This week Jason Snell published his annual <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/" title="Six Colors: “Apple in 2024: The Six Colors report card”">Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2024</a> . As I&#39;ve done in the past — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/my_2023_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball: “My 2023 Apple Report Card”">2023</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/my_2022_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2022 Apple Report Card”">2022</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/my_2021_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2021 Apple Report Card”">2021</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/01/my_2020_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2020 Apple Report Card”">2020</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/my_2019_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2019 Apple Report Card”">2019</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2018 Apple Report Card”">2018</a> — I&#39;m publishing my full remarks and grades here. On Snell&#39;s report card, voters give per-category scores ranging from 5 to 1;我将这些翻译成字母等级，A到F，这就是我考虑的方式。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-07">1</a></sup></p><p> Most of my grades are unchanged from a year ago. For those that have changed, I&#39;ve noted last year&#39;s grade in parentheses. I didn&#39;t realize this as I was writing my report card, but each of my grades that changed from last year was <em>lower</em> . Not one grade went up. Thinking about that as I write this preamble today, it feels correct: there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent excellence in 2024, but I can&#39;t think of a single area where Apple levelled up.不是一个。 That feels like a problem. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-07">2</a></sup></p><p> It&#39;s also worth noting that “Siri” is not a standalone category in the report card. We graders simply comment on it as one aspect within other categories and products, like HomePod or Apple Music. Historically that made sense — when it <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/10/04Apple-Launches-iPhone-4S-iOS-5-iCloud/">started</a> , Siri was just a flashy new feature of iOS 5. At this point, though, I think “Siri/Apple Intelligence” clearly deserves to be considered as a category unto itself. One way to think about it: anything that comprises the entire domain of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">senior Apple executive</a> probably ought to be its own category on the report card. For Siri and Apple Intelligence, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a> . For another: Apple&#39;s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=apple+intelligence+commercials">heavy marketing of Apple Intelligence</a> suggests they themselves consider it a category-level aspect of the company. I&#39;ve suggested this to Snell, and he&#39;s considering adding it as a proper category next year. (And, unsurprisingly, given his own <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/where-will-apple-intelligence-go-next/">sharp writing on the subject</a> , he was already thinking about it before I pinged him.)</p><p> If “Siri/Apple Intelligence” <em>were</em> a category for this report card, I&#39;d have graded it a D — and much closer to an F than a C. Longstanding Siri features have not only <em>not</em> gotten better, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">they&#39;ve seemingly gotten worse</a> 。 Apple is simply not a relevant player in the explosively popular LLM game. The features under the “Apple Intelligence” umbrella mostly feel like Apple shipped them a full year ahead of readiness simply because the rest of the industry — and Wall Street — is way ahead of them, and they felt the need to ship what they had,准备好了没。 There are a lot of obviously useful potential AI-powered features — ones that integrate between apps, and/or use your personal data on-device — that, thanks to the tightly restricted sandboxing system Apple itself designed for iOS, only Apple itself can provide via AI. It doesn&#39;t matter that Apple doesn&#39;t offer, say, its own web search engine, because Safari can use whatever search engine <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/kagi">you want</a> . It <em>does</em> matter that Siri sucks because only Siri can tightly integrate at the system level with your device, and with your private cross-application data.节省的宽限期 - 使我无法将这个类别类别的If-If If Five Grace a-F给出了F的，这实际上是Apple的ML/AI功能中的一些功能实际上很棒。 Image search in Photos is excellent, downright amazing at times. The new Clean Up generative AI object/person removal tool in Photos is very good — both technically, and in terms of striking an opinionated balance regarding the nature of photography itself. Private Cloud Compute is a tremendously ambitious initiative — but we haven&#39;t seen much fruit from it yet.</p><h2> Mac: A</h2><p> The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years. Even better, both now seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. Personally I am especially pleased, borderline ecstatic, regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150 extra. (They don&#39;t even charge more for the option on the 16-models than 14-inch.)</p><p> The only hitch in the lineup are the Macs Apple <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111835">remain</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111343">unchanged</a> since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC&#39;s first-generation 3nm process, and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC.</p><p> MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release. Reliable and familiar. Apple Intelligence features that I largely don&#39;t use (or at least don&#39;t use much <em>yet</em> ) are easily ignored and do not get in the way of what is tried and true about, by far, the greatest computing platform the world has ever看到。</p><h2> iPhone: A</h2><p> If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. Nothing has been broke regarding the iPhone lineup, and Apple hasn&#39;t tried to fix anything.这很好。 Changes for the sake of change are the surest sign of a company in decline. Stagnation and hubris are concerns for any wildly successful product, but it takes confidence to let great design speak for itself without making facile unnecessary changes.</p><p> Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I&#39;d like to see the actual button improve (I think it&#39;s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Also: kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models.</p><p> iOS 18 is refined, mature, and familiar.</p><h2> iPad: C</h2><p> The iPad hardware story is excellent. iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac, and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. (Please, Apple: bring nano-texture to the iPhone. Take my money.) The iPad Air got a fine update to the M2 chip in May. And the iPad Mini got its first update since 2021, and thus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/transcript-phil-schiller-craig-federighi-and-john-ternus-on-the-state-of-apples-pro-macs/">continues to be a product in Apple&#39;s lineup</a> .</p><p> But iPadOS still strikes me like the no-man&#39;s-land platform: nowhere near as capable productivity-wise as a Mac; nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months. I find myself noticeably more productive for it. Trying to work on an iPad, for me, continues to feel like trying to perform surgery while wearing mittens.</p><h2> Wearables Overall: B</h2><p> AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update. AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements this year — most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods继续以最佳体现为例。</p><h2> Apple Watch: C (last year: B)</h2><p> Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn&#39;t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/faces-and-features-apde9218b440/watchos">Flux and Reflections</a> . Setting aside the fact that I personally don&#39;t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11 offers, by my quick count, at least 33 different watch faces that offer a non-digital seconds hand or indicator. And only 2 of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate?那是胡扯。 And it wasn&#39;t just a launch thing, because here we are in February, with WatchOS 11.3, and zero additional watch faces have been updated to support it. This is not how a serious watchmaker treats its watches. I will admit to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch">caring far more about always-on seconds hands than most people</a> , but this isn&#39;t how a serious watchmaker deals with technical breakthroughs like this new display with a 1Hz refresh rate. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch.</p><p> Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that&#39;s it.一款起价为800美元的手表有点奇怪，这似乎很受欢迎，可以跳过一年的硅改进。</p><h2> Vision Pro: B (last year: N/A)</h2><p>这是一个热门吗？不，远离它。 But I remain <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/vision_pro_bites_dog">unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope</a> that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it&#39;s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today&#39;s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the primary impetus for John Sculley and Apple&#39;s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company. Many pundits of the era confidently proclaimed that the entire concept of a GUI was a gimmick with no future.</p><p> Am I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has <em>a</em> bright and essential future ahead of it. The entire concept and paradigm is so new and different that, like the Macintosh 40 years prior, the product had to ship years before a version will be made at a price that appeals to the mass market, and years before there&#39;s all that much to do using it.</p><p> But, as it stands, Vision Pro today offers an incredible experience for watching traditional movies and shows, and a breakthrough experience for watching spatial content. If Bang &amp; Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price. Spatial computing feels fun to me, but not very productive. That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro&#39;s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118521">Mac Virtual Display</a> feature is a highly-productive environment for work.</p><p> I can&#39;t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A&#39;s in future years.</p><h2> Home: D (last year: C)</h2><p> I can&#39;t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something.</p><h2> Apple TV: C (last year: B)</h2><p> I&#39;m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024?任何事物？ It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we&#39;re grading what happened在2024年。</p><p> Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. The current one is their best yet, but it has obvious flaws.</p><h2> Services: B</h2><p> TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I&#39;d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: <em>Wolfs</em> should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+&#39;s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: <em>Slow Horses</em> had another crackerjack season, <em>For All Mankind</em> finished a good fourth season, and new shows like <em>Dark Matter</em> , <em>Bad Monkey</em> , and <em>Presumed Innocent</em> were all strong. TV+ is also a great streaming platform for young kids.</p><p> iCloud，尤其是在iCloud Plus的情况下，保持安全，快速和可靠。 It enables so much seamless continuity (hence Apple&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> ” umbrella brand for those features) across devices.</p><p> But here we are again, with me repeating the same gripe from previous years: it&#39;s miserly that Apple is still offering a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier, and have left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged since like forever.我垃圾大于5 GB。 I wonder how many zillions of iPhone users out there don&#39;t have device backups because they only have a free iCloud account with 5 GB? The Apple One bundle is a good deal, but the free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do.</p><h2> Hardware Reliability: A</h2><p> No news remains great news in this category.</p><h2> Apple OS Quality: B<br/> Apple Apps: B</h2><p> Unchanged comment, and grade, from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple&#39;s software <em>design</em> is headed (or in some ways, has been now for years), but their software <em>reliability</em> has been very good for me.</p><p> One odd trend: several of Apple&#39;s newest apps, like Journal and Sports (and now, though outside the temporal boundary for a 2024 report card, Invites) are only available for iPhone. Not even iOS, including iPhone and iPad. Just iPhone. Journal in particular belongs on iPadOS and MacOS, too, where people have hardware keyboards for writing.</p><h2> Developer Relations: D (last year: C)</h2><p> Fourth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple&#39;s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple&#39;s platforms. The opposite is happening.</p><p> The big change globally this year is the Digital Markets Act going into effect in the EU. I stand apart from many in the Cupertino punditry racket in applauding Apple for their compliance efforts. I think they&#39;ve complied with a terrible law as best they can while protecting their own vision for how their platforms should be designed and work. (And, of course, protecting their own vision for how Apple should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can&#39;t and won&#39;t argue that any of Apple&#39;s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers.</p><p> Despite the situation being largely unchanged, I&#39;ve adjusted my grade on this subject from C to D this year, because stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse. And I think we saw that with the relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro. There&#39;s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- <em>and</em> third-party apps and games.</p><p> With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform. That enthusiasm was tempered greatly last year for VisionOS, and I think it was a lot more about how developers feel about Apple and the App Store than how they feel about Vision Pro itself.</p><h2> Social and Societal Impact: B (last year: A)</h2><p> Snell&#39;s prompt for this category states, “Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple&#39;s work force, and other political and policy stances.” Apple&#39;s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary. Their accessibility features are so far ahead of the rest of the industry that I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s in second place. On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple&#39;s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now sharply right.</p><p> If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade. But: politics. I understand (I think) Tim Cook&#39;s thinking and approach. I wouldn&#39;t want his job, and genuinely wonder at times who would. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">Sing-song congratulatory tweets</a> leave a bitter taste, but I&#39;m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they&#39;ve been dealt, not the cards they&#39;d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don&#39;t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can&#39;t donate $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/the-great-american-tradition">a mere $43,200 to Biden&#39;s</a> and expect us to do anything but laugh at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">the supposed justification</a> that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That&#39;s Tim Cook&#39;s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it&#39;s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it.</p><p> I genuinely believe Cook is doing what&#39;s best for Apple, and that&#39;s quite literally his job. But it was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/cook_trump_campaign_ad">true during the first Trump administration</a> , and already is again in the second, that what&#39;s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what&#39;s best for the country and for the world.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-07"><p> In my previous report cards I&#39;ve described my scale as A to E (A = 5 ... E = 1), but here in the US, schools <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/9283/grading-system-why-a-f-and-not-e">traditionally</a> (but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uofu/comments/bofpny/what_is_the_difference_between_an_e_grade_and_an/">not always</a> ) omit E as a letter grade and use F as the grade below D, as the obvious shorthand for <em>fail</em> — and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">apparently</a> , to disambiguate from some weirdo schools that use a system in which E stands for <em>excellent</em> . (I give that grading system an F.) I never had to give the E vs. F thing much thought before, because I never thought it appropriate to give a failing grade in any category before. But pondering a hypothetical “Siri/Apple Intelligence” category this year got me thinking long and hard about a failing grade. And I realized that should be an F, not an E. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-07"><p> If you said to me, “ <em>Come on Grubes, you can&#39;t think of a</em> single <em>area where Apple did better in 2024 than 2023? Not one? There has to be something...</em> ” I would offer as a response, without hesitation, Apple TV original content. As I wrote just over a month ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/31/">in my final post of the year</a> , I would argue with anyone that the average quality of an Apple TV+ original show is higher than that for any other streaming platform. It really is the new HBO — not the most content, but the best content. That&#39;s very <em>Apple</em> .</p><p> But that&#39;s not a separate category on the Six Colors Report Card. Apple TV+ falls under “Services” (under which category I call it out for praise in this very report card), and my very high esteem for Apple TV+&#39;s original content doesn&#39;t justify bumping up my grade for “Services” as a whole — a sprawling category that, financially, a decade ago become Apple&#39;s second-biggest and is <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">seemingly on a trajectory</a> to <a href="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apple-earnings-1.png?ssl=1">eventually surpass even the iPhone</a> — from a B to an A.</p><p> I don&#39;t see Apple&#39;s foray into entertainment production as a distraction. The people at Apple working on computer hardware, software, and services, whether they be engineers, designers, managers, or even senior executives, aren&#39;t involved in any way with TV+. And it&#39;s not like Apple is cash-starved and diverting limited resources to entertainment production budgets at the expense of product development or R&amp;D. Apple, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, can act a bit like a conglomerate without losing focus on its core business of making the world&#39;s best computers, on which customers enjoy the world&#39;s best computing experiences. TV+ is an important leg on the stool of reasons for people to subscribe to an Apple One services bundle. But, still, it&#39;s at least a little worrisome that the area where I feel Apple most improved last year is one that is utterly unrelated to that core business.</p><p> Excellence, no matter how long sustained, is always precarious — delicate and fragile — and on the verge of succumbing to hubris and Father Time. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ My 2024 Apple Report Card</title></entry><entry><title> Apple Settles Lawsuit Against Former Employee Who Leaked to The Information and WSJ </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/apple-leaker-issues-apology/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w28" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41552</id><published> 2025-02-07T18:10:53Z</published><updated> 2025-02-07T18:14:37Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

During that time, I was given access to sensitive internal Apple information, including what were then unreleased products and features.但是，我没有将这些信息保密，而是犯了与涵盖公司的记者分享此信息的错误。 I did not realize it at the time, but this turned out to be a profound and expensive mistake.我花了数年的建筑物毁了数百个专业关系。 And my otherwise successful career as a software engineer was derailed, and it will likely be very difficult to rebuild it. Leaking was not worth it. I sincerely apologize to my former colleagues who not only worked tirelessly on projects for Apple, but work hard to keep them secret. They deserved better.</p></blockquote><p> We don&#39;t know the terms of Aude&#39;s agreement with Apple that ended the lawsuit, but it&#39;s good to see he and the company remain on close enough terms for Apple to have helped him craft that apology. (Either that, or Aude should have worked in Apple&#39;s comms department, not engineering.)</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/apple-sues-leaker-andrew-aude">Here&#39;s my post from last March</a> when the lawsuit was filed, which includes a few of the juiciest nuggets, including this, from Apple&#39;s filing:</p><blockquote><p> Apple learned of Mr. Aude&#39;s misconduct in the fall of 2023. When Apple met with him to discuss his improper disclosures, Mr. Aude promptly confirmed his guilt through his actions, if not his words. At the start of his November 7, 2023 interview, Mr. Aude repeatedly denied that he had leaked any information to anyone. He also claimed that he did not have his Apple-issued work iPhone with him. Feigning the need to visit the bathroom mid-interview, Mr. Aude then extracted his iPhone from his pocket during the break and permanently deleted significant amounts of evidence from his device. This included the Signal app, which memorialized his history of leaking information to “Homeboy” (and likely others) via encrypted communications. [...]</p><p> In Mr. Aude&#39;s screenshot below memorializing his exchange with the WSJ journalist, Mr. Aude exclaimed that he could not “wait for chaos to break out” in reaction to a forthcoming article reflecting his leaked information.</p></blockquote><p> End-to-end encrypted comms don&#39;t help much when you save screenshots of those chats to your work-issued company-controlled device.</p><p> And my own closing:</p><blockquote><p> Worth noting that Aaron “Homeboy” Tilley <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/u/aarontilley">was a reporter for The Information</a> until September 2019, when he left to join the WSJ. Anyway, I&#39;m sure the WSJ will help Aude out with his legal bills.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Settles Lawsuit Against Former Employee Who Leaked to The Information and WSJ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/bootable_mac_startup_drive_backups_and_another_ode_to_superduper" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w27" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41551</id><published> 2025-02-06T19:07:17Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T20:32:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我知道今天的存储方式不同 - 丰富，便宜，可靠 - 但是我仍然对植根于遥远过去的数据有感觉。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

After reviewing a lot of comments on this subject, I felt it was time to weigh in. Apple is taking a lot of heat for this “bug” in 15.2, but if there is any finger-pointing here, I think it should be directed towards any developers that have misled their users into believing that ASR and “bootable backups” had any place in a backup/recovery strategy post-Big Sur.</p></blockquote><p> That feels like some shade thrown toward Nanian and Shirt Pocket, but here we are with MacOS 15.3, and bootable startup drive clones are back, so I have to question who needs to don sunglasses here.</p><p>我认为没有人会质疑“创建可引导的启动驱动器克隆”在苹果硅时代变得复杂，该苹果时代从2020年底Macos 11 Big Sur开始。更不用说从HFS+转换引入的并发症to APFS with MacOS 10.13 High Sierra in 2017, and the read-only boot volume and SIP with MacOS 10.15 Catalina in 2019. M-series Macs boot weirder than Intel-based Macs.还<em>不错</em>。 I think it&#39;s all justified in the pursuit of security (SIP stands for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102149" title="Apple Support: “About System Integrity Protection on your Mac”">System Integrity Protection</a> , and is aptly named) and elegant system architecture. But booting is now <em>makes-things-much-more-difficult-than-before</em> weird for tools like SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner.</p><p> It&#39;s also true that from the perspective of <em>most</em> Mac users, all of these changes have been, unambiguously, changes for the better. Catastrophic boot drive errors seem to occur with less frequency than ever. Part of that is simply because SSDs are far more reliable than spinning hard disks, but part of it too is that APFS seems more reliable than HFS+ ever was. HFS+ wasn&#39;t unreliable — and its reliability levelled up with the addition of journaling back in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-06">1</a></sup> — but APFS seems more reliable. When catastrophe does strike, the path to recovery is better than ever. In the old days, you&#39;d need to find a bootable system software DVD (or, going back in time, a CD, or a floppy...) or a bootable USB drive, and reinstall the OS from disk. In recent years, however, that&#39;s been replaced by the built-in <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="苹果支持：“ MacOS恢复介绍”">MacOS Recovery</a> system that lets you do things like run Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup, reinstall the entire OS from scratch, and more.没有寻找特殊的CD/DVD或Thumb Drive（墨菲的定律表明，当您突然发现自己需要一个时，您不会方便）。 Just long-press the power button on your Mac and boom — you&#39;re in Recovery mode.</p><p> I have no data to prove that APFS is more reliable than HFS+ was, so to check my gut feeling, I asked both John Siracusa (filesystem aficionado <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-06">2</a></sup> ) and Nanian (who works in the trenches of SuperDuper customer support).双方都同意APF更可靠。 Nanian further observed, though, that when things do go catastrophically wrong with an APFS disk now, it tends to be at a very low level — corruption at the container or volume level.而且，如果苹果自己的磁盘实用程序无法修复它，则没有任何第三方工具可以。 <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-06">3</a></sup> That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is, if the problem really is just with uncorrectable corruption (and <em>not</em> a hardware failure with the device), you can use Recovery to fully erase the drive and container, clean install the OS, and restore your data from your backup drive using Migration Assistant — and that will almost certainly work.</p><p>因此，从某种意义上说，论点提出，不再需要启动驱动器的可启动克隆。只需克隆您的数据，而不是整个驱动器，即用于备份目的的外部驱动器，如果您的启动卷出现问题：</p><ol><li> <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="苹果支持：“ MacOS恢复介绍”">Boot into Recovery</a> .</li><li>尝试使用恢复内部的磁盘实用程序来修复启动磁盘。从层次上讲，您首先在音量级别上执行此操作，然后在容器级别，然后是设备本身。 A device encompasses containers, containers encompass volumes, and you should repair from the inside out. This support document from Apple, “ <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/repair-a-storage-device-dskutl1040/mac" title="Apple Support :“Repair a Storage Device in Disk Utility on Mac”">Repair a Storage Device in Disk Utility on Mac</a> ”, explains and illustrates the process.</li><li>如果磁盘实用程序无法修复它，请使用恢复擦除磁盘，然后安装OS。</li><li>在清洁安装后的第一个引导过程中，选择“还原”的选项（实际上像运行迁移助手一样），然后选择您的外部驱动器，并在上一个启动卷中的备用克隆作为源。 In other words, treat your restored Mac as though it&#39;s a brand-new Mac. (If you get to the point of creating a new, fresh user account, you&#39;ve gone too far.)</li></ol><p>您在上面的步骤3中使用的备份不需要在其上安装MACOS，或者，如果它具有MacOS的可启动副本，则该版本不需要是MacOS的MacOS版本内部驱动器。在SuperDuper中，您可以使用智能更新使用“备份 - 所有文件”，该更新键入可写入的“数据”卷中的所有内容，但不会从读取的“系统”（OS）卷中复制OS（因为它can&#39;t, for technical reasons you and I need not worry about — seriously, this stuff will take you <em>deep</em> into the weeds).</p><p>但是，让我尝试通过我作为超级用户想知道和理解的我的速度来速度。 To make a clone of your internal startup drive to an external drive, you want to use “Backup - all files”. (SuperDuper&#39;s “Backup - user files” will only back up what&#39;s in user account home folders inside <code>/Users/</code> . That will include most of your personal files, but it won&#39;t include system-wide data that&#39;s shared between all users, such as applications you&#39;ve installed in the top-level <code>/Applications/</code> folder, or everything in <code>/Library/</code> . I&#39;m sure some people have a need for “Backup - user files”, but I don&#39;t. And it&#39;s worth pointing out从“备份 - 用户文件”中包含克隆的数据的外部驱动器无法作为我的迁移助手的来源。迁移助理，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs#fn2-2020-11-17">正如我之前写的那样</a>，这是一个惊人的好工具。）</p><p> When you run “Backup - all files”, you have the following options: <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-06">4</a></sup></p><ul><li> <em>Erase, then copy</em> — This completely erases the external destination volume before copying over the entire contents of your internal startup drive. This takes longer than Smart Update, but, importantly, “Erase, then copy” will clone the <em>entire</em> internal disk, including the read-only System volume containing MacOS. This should leave you with a <em>bootable</em> clone of your startup drive.</li><li> <em>Smart Update</em> — This does what you think a “smart” update would do. Instead of copying everything, every time, it just copies and erases what&#39;s necessary to make the Data volume on the destination disk identical to the Data volume on the source disk.如果您从新鲜的空外部驱动器作为目的地开始，它必须复制所有内容，但是随后的智能更新运行将在一部分时间内运行。 But the nature of how it works means that it can only clone the read/write Data volume of your startup drive. That means it won&#39;t copy the OS from the read-only System volume. No matter what else you do (which I&#39;m about to cover), that&#39;s OK, because the result of a Smart Update is an external drive containing all of your own files and installed apps, and, crucially, it&#39;s a disk that you can use as the source for Migration Assistant.</li></ul><p> So if you <em>always</em> use “Erase, then copy”, your SuperDuper external backups will always be bootable clones of your startup drive, with the same version of MacOS installed as your internal disk. The only downside to doing it this way is that backups take longer, because you&#39;re erasing the external drive and copying everything every time. （您不必以任何方式监督超级垃圾的备份，因此它们要花多长时间并不重要。）</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Smart Update”, you won&#39;t have a bootable external drive (because the read-only System volume is never copied over), but you will have all your own files, and the external drive will work as a source for Migration Assistant.</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Erase, then copy” to create the initial backup clone, but <em>subsequently</em> use “Smart Update” for incremental backups, all of <em>your</em> data and installed apps will be updated on the external drive each time you back up. And the drive should remain a bootable backup — but the version of MacOS installed on the external drive will remain unchanged from the initial “Erase, then copy” backup.这就是我一直在运行Superduper的方式。</p><h2>为什么可启动备份驱动器仍然很重要</h2><p>在撰写本文的过程中 - 自12月以来，我一直在考虑并进行研究，当时MacOS 15.2复制器Bug破坏了Superduper创建可引导备份的能力 - 我已经动摇了一些关于我自己的长期假设我的备份需要。 I&#39;ve been making bootable clones with SuperDuper since whenever I started using it, which was over two decades ago. The earliest of mention of SuperDuper on Daring Fireball is this post, explaining how I installed OS updates at the time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/12/software_update" title="Daring Fireball: “Software Update Tips and Voodoo”">from December 2004</a> :</p><blockquote><p>我使用<a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">Superduper</a>克隆整个启动驱动器。我强烈推荐它。</p></blockquote><p> Still true!我无意停止使用Superduper定期备份整个启动驱动器。 But: do I care anymore whether they&#39;re bootable? If you&#39;d asked me before December, I would have said yes, definitely.为什么？ Because, my thinking went, if something catastrophic happened to my internal startup drive, and I was working on something urgent, I&#39;d want to get back up and working again as soon as possible.与其等待MACOS恢复重新安装在内部驱动器上，然后等待迁移助手将我的数据从外部驱动器复制到内部驱动器上的MacOS安装，而只能从外部备份驱动器中启动并获取立即返回工作。</p><p>我多年来作为MAC用户很幸运，遭受了很少的磁盘灾难。但是我遇到了它们。在某些情况下，如果不是至关重要的，则具有最新的可启动备份驱动器是有用的。 But, upon reflection, I realize now that it&#39;s been many many years since the last time I even thought to boot from my backup drive. I used to even periodically test that the backup drive was, in fact, bootable, as a precaution.我好几年没做到了。</p><p> I mentioned above that for my regular backup cloning, I use SuperDuper&#39;s Smart Update, which leaves the read-only installation of MacOS on the backup drive unchanged.我今天刚刚检查过，而我的MacBook Pro正在运行当前版本的MacOS（15.3红杉），而克隆的备份驱动器上的版本则为12.6.1 Monterey，该版本于2022年10月发布。 “Erase, then copy” backup in SuperDuper.) That effectively means my backup drive <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been bootable, or at least not <em>usefully</em> bootable. For example, all my email files are in the mailbox format expected by Apple Mail in MacOS 15.3;我怀疑MacOS 12.6的Apple邮件是否可以读取这些邮箱文件。 The same is probably true for just about every app — or at least every system app from Apple — that I use. Surely <em>some</em> software from MacOS 12.6 can&#39;t read the files or settings from the software from MacOS 15.3, and I&#39;ll bet a lot of it can&#39;t. New software can often recognize old file formats generated by older versions of the software; old software can&#39;t recognize new file formats that were introduced after the old software was written.</p><p> What you should do, if you really want bootable startup drive backups via SuperDuper, is use “Erase, then copy” after every MacOS software update. Or just use “Erase, then copy” every time. But the fact that I wasn&#39;t doing this for the last two years doesn&#39;t mean my cloned backup drive has been useless. It just means it&#39;s only been useful for restoring backed-up data, not for booting my Mac. Which, when I think about it, is how I would have used it if I had needed to. I don&#39;t work in a fast-paced production environment with tight deadlines.无论如何，我认为MacBook确实只有从内部驱动器启动时才能正确运行。 If something ever goes wrong with mine, I&#39;ll try using Disk Utility to repair it, and if that fails, I&#39;ll turn to MacOS Recovery to clean install the OS and then use Migration Assistant to copy my data back from my external backup驾驶。</p><p> Thinking about it, booting from an old version of MacOS on an external backup drive containing data from the current version of MacOS sounds like a good way to corrupt some of the files on that disk — subverting the entire purpose of a backup. (Most likely, if you try this, the Mac will simply fail to boot.) It&#39;s reckless to boot from and “use” a backup drive for production when the source drive that it&#39;s a clone of has failed — at that point, your backup drive is your only local copy of the data from that failed drive. It really only ought to be treated as a read-only source for restoration. And the way Macs are designed to work today, with MacOS Recovery and Migration Assistant, makes that pretty easy.</p><p> The last time I had a catastrophic problem with my startup drive was in 2010, and I wrote about how I recovered, gracefully and with no drama (nor, seemingly, an iota of lost data), in a piece I titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox">An Ode to DiskWarrior, SuperDuper, and Dropbox</a> ”. More of my digital life is in the cloud — and thus replicated in at least one place other than my Mac&#39;s startup drive — now than then. Off the top of my head, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of anything I do on my Mac that isn&#39;t synced to cloud storage via Dropbox, iCloud, or IMAP. Starting in 2014 I&#39;ve also been a customer of <a href="https://backblaze.com/thetalkshow">Backblaze</a> , a set-it-and-forget-it online backup service (that, for many years, has been a regular sponsor of this site and The Talk Show, but I recommend it because it&#39;s good, not because they have been and might someday again be a sponsor). That&#39;s <em>another</em> copy of all my personal data backed up somewhere. <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-06">5</a></sup></p><p> Having my SuperDuper-cloned backup drive be bootable is nice to have, but I really can&#39;t say I <em>need</em> it any more. 20, 15, even just 10 years ago, that wasn&#39;t true — I really did want the ability to boot from my backup drive at a moment&#39;s notice. But that&#39;s really not true any more for me. It probably isn&#39;t for you, either.对于大多数Mac用户来说，绝对不是正确的。</p><p> But it remains true for <em>some</em> people, who are using (or responsible for) Macs in high-pressure tight-deadline production environments. Live broadcast studios.杂志或报纸的截止日期为打印机，仅几个小时（或几分钟）。 Places with strict security/privacy rules that forbid cloud storage of certain critical files. If the startup drive on a production machine fails, they need to get up and running <em>now</em> .插入备份驱动器，重新启动并进行。 Anything longer than that is unacceptable.</p><p>那不是我。 That&#39;s probably not you. But there are a lot of people whose work environment that describes. For as much as Apple Silicon Macs have become iOS-like devices in many ways, they&#39;re still Macs at heart: workstations. There remain people inside Apple who know that, too.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-06"><p> Fun fact gleaned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">the Wikipedia entry for HFS Plus</a> : “Codenamed <em>Sequoia</em> in development, HFS+ was introduced with the January 19, 1998, release of Mac OS 8.1.” I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s further proof that Apple has a penchant for reusing old code names, or if code-name reuse is simply inevitable for a nearly 49-year-old company that&#39;s always been chockablock with secret projects. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-06"><p><em>丁。</em> <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-06"><p> APF非常“现代苹果”的方式之一是它主要是黑匣子。 In the HFS+ days, there was <a href="https://www.alsoft.com/">Alsoft&#39;s DiskWarrior</a> — which has always been able to perform seeming miracles, outright repairing (or at least restoring temporary access to) the contents of disks that Apple&#39;s own Disk Utility couldn&#39;t fix.

It&#39;s surprising that any of it survived. As a kid/teen in the &#39;80s, everything of mine existed only on floppy disks. Even the smallest-capacity hard drives were exorbitantly expensive. Apple&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Disk_20">Hard Disk 20</a> was a 20 megabyte external drive that cost $1,500 when it debuted in 1985, which is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">about $4,400</a> in today&#39;s dollars. That was a ton of money. But the floppy disks of the time were just 400 KB — a Hard Disk 20 gave you the storage of 50 of them. But even floppy disks were expensive, to a kid. We&#39;d fill them up faster than we could buy them, and we&#39;d re-use the same floppies over and over when we needed a “new” one — often begrudgingly erasing whatever was previously on the old one.这对于存储介质上的数据完整性并不理想，以至于它暴露在空气中。在90年代，我们所有人都有硬盘驱动器，但是那些硬盘驱动器总是几乎饱满的。我们不断地将文件从硬盘驱动器中复制到软盘中以进行“存储”，以创建一些自由空间。 It felt like remarkable progress when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive">Zip disks</a> appeared, which were like “super floppies”, each containing 100 MB. We lived our digital lives one catastrophic hard drive failure away from losing almost all of our files, and the hard drives of that era were, by today&#39;s standards, flaky as hell. (If you heard your hard drive start to <em>click</em> , you panicked, and immediately began copying your most important files to another disk or disks.)</p><p> My grandparents&#39; generation lived through the Great Depression, and they wound up with, to my generation&#39;s eyes, very odd ideas about the availability and abundance of food.

[...]</p><p> As a recently deleted (by who?) post on the r/iOS subreddit explains, Apple&#39;s iOS App Store welcomes apps that host tons of porn, as Reddit does, as long as the majority of the content isn&#39;t porn, and the app has controls to hide the porn.</p></blockquote><p> Sweeney has a real point here, and it really is a bit of a conundrum. I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s alluding to with the “by who?” parenthetical, but I don&#39;t think one deleted Reddit thread on the topic was the result of Apple dispatching some Men in Black agents to knock on Reddit&#39;s door. Reddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/mt4l64/why_can_ios_apps_like_reddit_and_twitter_host/">full</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l03kt7/why_is_the_reddit_app_still_in_the_app_stores/">non-deleted</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/seu2zx/why_does_apple_ban_from_the_appstore_apps_like/">threads</a> from people asking variations of the same question. And the press has been covering the saga <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/reddit-ios-apps-disappear-nsfw-content/">for a decade</a> .</p><p> But how is it possible that these super popular platforms have apps in the no-porn App Store while hosting tons of porn?这是Reddit， <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tumblr-adds-sensitive-content-filter-to-ios-app">Tumblr</a> （ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store">多次</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">）</a>的问题， <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/04/x-twitter-porn-policy-under-18-opt-in">显然是X</a> （FKA Twitter）的问题。 (I&#39;m not trying to feign prudishness here, but I&#39;ve heard, several times, that you really <em>don&#39;t</em> want to go looking for NSFW content on X because what you&#39;ll find is ... something.)</p><p> I think Sweeney&#39;s synopsis captures Apple&#39;s de facto policy accurately, with the exception that they don&#39;t <em>welcome</em> apps that host porn (so long as the app has controls to hide it, and if the adult content is effectively a side hustle in the overall context of the app), but <em>tolerate</em> it. It&#39;s a de facto policy of tolerating unadvertised pornographic content on platforms that are too big to ban from the App Store without generating far more of an outcry than any controversy over the side-hustle porn will.</p><p> Some banks are too big to fail. Some platforms are too big to ban. Apple won&#39;t say that, but that&#39;s clearly the tacit policy. It&#39;s not confusing that the exceptions are super popular apps — they are exceptions <em>because</em> they&#39;re super popular. And it&#39;s absolutely not a policy of looking the other way — Apple&#39;s policing of the situation is an enormous never-ending pain in the ass for the platforms involved. To see NSFW content in the iOS Reddit app, for example, you need to be signed in, <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061032831-How-do-I-view-NSFW-communities">and enable an off-by-default setting</a> . <a href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/potentially-mature-content/">Tumblr does similar</a> . You can&#39;t just download the Reddit or Tumblr apps from the App Store and innocuously find yourself viewing pornography.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple’s App Store’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> AltStore PAL Is Free of Charge, Thanks to &#39;MegaGrant&#39; From Epic Games </title><link href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w25" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/altstore-pal-epic" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41549</id><published> 2025-02-04T23:23:51Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T23:23:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/hot_tob_hardcore_porno_app_eu">in its media statement re: Hot Tub</a> (the you-have-to-admit-it&#39;s-a-fun-name hardcore porn app now available in the AltStore PAL alternative app marketplace in the EU), closed its statement with the following: “The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.”</p><p> On X, Epic CEO <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1886533813444207012">Tim Sweeney wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Contrary to Apple&#39;s false statement, the Epic Games Store doesn&#39;t carry this app, doesn&#39;t carry any porn apps, and has never carried porn apps.</p></blockquote><p> Epic Games does run <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">an alternative app marketplace for iOS in the EU</a> , and Sweeney is correct that neither Hot Tub, nor any other porno apps, are in it. But what Apple is alluding to here is Epic&#39;s financial backing of AltStore by way of an “ <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">Epic MegaGrant</a> ”. AltStore <a href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226">announced the grant back in August</a> :</p><blockquote><p> GOOD NEWS EU 🇪🇺 For innovation in app distribution, Epic Games has granted us a MegaGrant grant that we plan to use to cover Apple&#39;s Core Technology Fee going forward — and we won&#39;t take it for granted!</p><p>这是什么意思？ AltStore PAL is now FREE — no subscription necessary 🎉</p></blockquote><p> Prior to the grant, AltStore PAL charged €1.50 per installation to cover Apple&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a> , the rules for which have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=d0z8d8rx">gotten more complicated</a> since originally announced, but for app marketplaces themselves (like AltStore PAL) costs €0.50 per-user per-first-installation per-year.

<p>From <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/113940550587737112">an AltStore announcement yesterday</a> :</p><blockquote><p> iPhone Turn 18今年，这意味着它终于足够老了，可以使用更多的〜成熟〜应用程序…</p><p> Introducing Hot Tub by c1d3r, the world&#39;s 1st Apple-approved porn app!</p></blockquote><p> The screenshots and video previews are blurred-for-obfuscation by default, but <a href="https://hottubapp.io/">Hot Tub&#39;s website</a> makes pretty clear that the content it aggregates is serious porn. Figuratively speaking, they&#39;re not fucking around. Literally speaking, that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re aggregating — including an in-app “teens” channel.</p><p> Describing Hot Tub as “Apple-approved” is cheeky, if we&#39;re being generous, and downright misleading if we&#39;re not. What they mean is that Hot Tub was duly notarized by Apple — an ostensibly technical, not editorial, review that encompasses (using terms <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">from Apple&#39;s own documentation</a> ) accuracy, functionality, safety, security, and privacy. I say “ostensibly” there because Apple has, controversially, refused to notarize apps for other reasons, including in November <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">when it rejected for notarization the classic Mac emulator Mini vMac</a> , on the grounds that Mini vMac both violated Apple&#39;s software licensing terms and misused Apple&#39;s trademarks.</p><p> But pornography has pretty much always been Apple&#39;s canonical example for the sort of content they do not want in the App Store, and thus — because Apple&#39;s stance is that the App Store ought to be the sole source for consumer software for iOS — the sort of content they do not consider appropriate for native apps. You&#39;ve been able to watch porno on your iPhone since the first day it shipped — a full year ahead of the App Store — by using the web. Apple&#39;s line has always been clear: native apps = Apple-approved; the web = anything goes. (That same line goes for payment processing for digital goods and services as well.)</p><p> Back in 2010, MG Siegler (then at TechCrunch) reported on an email exchange between Steve Jobs and customer Matthew Browing. Browing wrote to Jobs:</p><blockquote><p> It appears that more and more Apple is determining for its consumers what content they should be able to receive. For instance, the blocking of Mark Fiore&#39;s comic app (due to being political satire) or blocking of what Apple considers to be porn.</p><p> I&#39;m all for keeping porn out of kids hands. Heck — I&#39;m all for ensuring that I don&#39;t have to see it unless I want to. But… that&#39;s what parental controls are for. Put these types of apps into categories and allow them to be blocked by their parents should they want to.</p><p> Apple&#39;s role isn&#39;t moral police — Apple&#39;s role is to design and produce really cool gadgets that do what the consumer wants them to do.</p></blockquote><p> Jobs responded:</p><blockquote><p> Fiore&#39;s app will be in the store shortly. That was a mistake. However, we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone. Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.</p></blockquote><p> (The man knew how to write an email.)</p><p> Fast-forward to the present, and Apple has been citing pornography as one of its reasons for adamantly opposing the EU&#39;s DMA from the very beginning. Last year, after the DMA went into effect, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">FastCompany&#39;s Michael Grothaus interviewed App Store chief Phil Schiller</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Schiller is quick to point out that despite these new security measures, there are limits to the protections that Apple can provide to users who allow alternative app marketplaces to operate on their iPhones. The company has virtually no control over the content of apps from those marketplaces — even if that content is objectionable or harmful.</p><p> “Ultimately, there are things that we have not allowed on our App Store — things that we didn&#39;t think would be safe or appropriate,” Schiller says. “It will not be our decision whether those other marketplaces have the same terms and limitations.”</p><p> So yes, for the first time, apps dedicated to pornography can be run on the iPhone.这应该是父母知道的，因为DMA并没有赋予Apple禁止某些类型的应用程序商店在其平台上运营的合法权利，Apple也没有能力阻止孩子将这种应用程序商店下载到他们的平台上iPhone。</p></blockquote><p> And, lastly, with regard to Hot Tub and AltStore in particular, Apple issued this statement to media outlets, including Daring Fireball, yesterday:</p><blockquote><p> We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids. This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world. Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store. The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.</p></blockquote><p> So, no, Apple neither approves of Hot Tub in particular, nor the ability to distribute native porn apps in general. Everyone involved with both AltStore and Hot Tub knows this, but they also know that framing it this way — the announcement came with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/introducing-hot-tub-banner.png">this banner graphic</a> promoting Hot Tub as “The First Apple-Approved Porn App” — is a good way to <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250203/p16#a250203p16">get headlines</a> . (The Verge: “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604937/iphone-ios-porn-app-hot-tub-altstore-pal-eu">The First &#39;Approved&#39; iPhone Porn App Is Coming to Europe</a> ” — which aside from the mild clickbait slant, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">misleadingly conflates “Europe” with “the EU”</a> .) But there&#39;s some undeniable <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/02/schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> seeing Apple on the wrong end <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">of notarization being used as a tool to convey subject-matter approval</a> . [ <strong>Update:</strong> And now <a href="https://www.threads.net/@altstoreio/post/DFqg4vfy7B4">it&#39;s become a thing</a> , where AltStore is sticking to their guns that Hot Tub, having been notarized, is thus “approved” by Apple. C&#39;mon.]</p><p> If we want to get nitty-gritty over verbs, I&#39;d argue that Apple <em>accepts</em> apps — like Hot Tub — for notarization, not <em>approves</em> . Begrudging <em>acceptance</em> is more of a thing than begrudging <em>approval</em> .</p><p> But, as Apple itself emphasizes in its statement, the DMA requires them to allow it. I&#39;ve seen no celebratory <a href="https://x.com/teresaribera">tweets</a> or <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/home/en">announcements from European Commission officials</a> celebrating the availability of Hot Tub. Just crickets chirping. When it comes to native iOS porn apps, the EU now has an unequivocal advantage over not just the United States but the rest of the world. You&#39;d think they&#39;d want to celebrate the achievement.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;Hot Tub&#39;, a Hardcore Porn App for iOS, Hits AltStore in the EU</title></entry><entry><title>抖动</title><link href="https://dithering.fm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w23" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/dithering" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41547</id><published> 2025-02-04T18:09:14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T18:09:15Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat">Speaking of books</a> , Simon &amp; Schuster announced a new one:</p><blockquote><p> Apple isn&#39;t just a brand; it&#39;s the world&#39;s most valuable company and creator of the twenty-first century&#39;s defining product. The iPhone has revolutionized the way we live, work and connect. But Apple is now a victim of its own success, caught in the middle of a new Cold War between two superpowers.</p><p> On the brink of bankruptcy in 1996, Apple launched a new strategy to outsource its manufacturing. After experimenting in eight countries, nearly all of its operations were lured to China by the promises of affordable, ubiquitous labour. As the iPod and iPhone transformed Apple&#39;s fortunes, their sophisticated production played a seminal role financing, training, supervising, and supplying Chinese manufacturers — skills Beijing is now weaponizing against the West.</p><p> <em>Apple in China</em> is the sometimes disturbing and always revelatory story of how an outspoken, proud company that once praised “rebels” and “troublemakers” — the company that encouraged us all to “Think Different” — devolved into a silent, passive partner to a belligerent regime that increasingly controls its fate.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve long been a fan of McGee&#39;s work as the Financial Times&#39;s Silicon Valley correspondent. Two years ago, the Financial Times ran a good two-part series by McGee that seemingly started him down the path to this book: “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5a80891-b27d-4110-90c9-561b7836f11b?accessToken=zwAAAZTN6lqvkdPVqAiRsn1BENOQyVYbeDbxGw.MEQCIBLmEdWXrV1FdyaYLM95iSpk2NbUN4rXb9DW3wSvZwzXAiBZ3xoDR8WENu91A2AKCy1xlinW7S6wSnK_6vU54_3U0A&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=fca686db-d401-45aa-9413-19bed1c546a8" title="麦吉（McGee）在2023年1月，pt。 1/2: “How Apple Tied Its Fortunes to China”">How Apple Tied Its Fortunes to China</a> ”, and “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/74f7e284-c047-4cc4-9b7a-408d40611bfa?accessToken=zwAAAZTN6rGikc909-KEwEdMxNObekCNQGEb-g.MEQCIFEiKzIfwaWOAw4oWCS2qJRTOxYvWRq_aOiLL9W52cReAiBGMxJbNZy8AO52S8J_NOHjfVsgX5tal9cYFkwRRnKGQg&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=2081eba1-72f0-4c8c-8cae-91bc46718e97" title="麦吉（McGee）在2023年1月，pt。 2/2: “What It Would Take for Apple to Disentangle Itself From China”">What It Would Take for Apple to Disentangle Itself From China</a> ”。两者都值得一读。 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/ft-apple-china-manufacture-country.png">This chart from the first report</a> shows just how reliant Apple remains on Chinese manufacturing, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/ft-apple-china-iphone-share.png">this one from the second</a> shows just how remarkably profitable the iPhone is.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Apple in China’ — New Book by Patrick McGee, Coming in May’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/apple-in-china-mcgee">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Rick Reilly&#39;s &#39;Commander in Cheat&#39; </title><link href="https://amzn.to/3Q8UJWd" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w20" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41544</id><published> 2025-02-03T18:54:33Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T22:59:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Drew Harwell, at The Washington Post (gift link, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lguxbx6fgc25">via Harwell himself on Bluesky</a> — which seemingly uses a ludicrously long 397-character token in the URL):</p><blockquote><p> But after poring over his live-streamed gameplay, online sleuths recently made a shocking accusation: Musk had cheated. They suspected that he had pursued a widely mocked tactic known as “boosting,” paying strangers to play his character and rake in loot so that, when he logged in, he could face challenges with the most powerful gear.</p><p> Musk fought the allegations before ultimately confessing in messages this month. “It&#39;s impossible to beat players in Asia if you don&#39;t,” he wrote. A few days later, his character could be seen chasing treasure through the game&#39;s sulfuric caverns while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/billionaires-trump-inauguration-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/">Musk was in the Capitol Rotunda, attending President Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Every cheater&#39;s story is the same: “ <em>I&#39;m not cheating, and I&#39;m offended you&#39;d accuse me.</em> ” Then, presented with incontrovertible proof, “ <em>I had to cheat because everyone else is cheating so it&#39;s the only way to win, and anyone who isn&#39;t doing it is a simp.</em> ”但简单的事实是，作弊者是烂的人，大多数人自然会鄙视作弊。</p><blockquote><p> But watching Musk&#39;s streams, Jake began to suspect foul play. The billionaire did amateurish things, such as failing to drink mana flasks when he needed them and trying to pick up items when his inventory was full. And he made comments that struck devoted players as clueless, saying, for instance, that his character&#39;s “Hand of Wisdom and Action” gloves, which rank among the game&#39;s most valuable items, “could be better.” A normal gamer could write these off as simple flubs in the heat of battle, Jake said. But Musk was supposedly a global grand master, and gamers at that level don&#39;t make these kinds of mistakes.</p><p> “It&#39;s like if you said you&#39;re the number two truck driver in the world … and when you try to get the truck to turn on, the windshield wipers start going,” Jake said. “It just felt like there was no way this guy did this.”</p><p> When Jake posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1hwxc17/documenting_the_saga_of_elon_musks_account/">thread</a> on Reddit documenting Musk&#39;s “suspicious” gameplay, the accusations kicked up a firestorm, with “Path of Exile 2” fans scraping through the streams Musk had posted to X for clues of what some were calling his <a href="https://x.com/Diamonte916/status/1878047536336052365">“stolen valor.透明</a>[...]</p><p> By paying someone else to earn him his high-level gear, they said, he had removed most of the challenge — only to boast how quickly he had beaten others who played fair and square. One poster on a Diablo subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1hxi3vh/gamers_are_accusing_elon_musk_of_cheating_at/">called</a> it “unbelievably pathetic” that the world&#39;s richest man would feel “the need to cheat” in a video game to “claim he is good at something” most people “couldn&#39;t care less about.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s the boasting that&#39;s most revealing.</p><p>这是小说本身就像小说一样古老的，反派在所有事情上作弊。 Auric Goldfinger cheated at golf, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBvu-fTTIk">famously</a> . And in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moonraker-James-Bond-Ian-Fleming/dp/1612185452/?tag=df-amzn-20">Ian Fleming&#39;s <em>Moonraker</em></a> (but not the movie), the whole plot was driven by M&#39;s suspicion that mysterious millionaire (the billionaire of the 1950s) industrialist Hugo Drax was cheating at cards at their gentlemen&#39;s club.他指派邦德弄清楚自己是如何作弊的，邦德偶然发现了德拉克斯的阴谋，以消灭伦敦。 Drax, you see, is in fact a Nazi. And his industry: rocketry.</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“视频游戏中的埃隆·马斯克作弊”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Don&#39;t Believe Him&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/dont-believe-him" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41542</id><published> 2025-02-03T15:37:24Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T17:27:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ezra Klein in an audio essay/transcribed column at The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> That is the tension at the heart of Trump&#39;s whole strategy: Trump is acting like a king because he is too weak to govern like a president.他正试图将感知代替现实。他希望感知成为现实。只有当我们相信他时，这种情况才会发生。 [...]</p><p>特朗普希望您在所有这项活动中看到的是命令。 What is really in all this activity is chaos. They do not have some secret reservoir of focus and attention the rest of us do not.他们已经说服自己，速度和力量本身就是一种策略 - 从某种意义上说，它是替代实际策略的策略。 Don&#39;t believe them.</p></blockquote><p> It is easy and quick, often instantaneous, to destroy things. It is hard and slow work to build new things, and often even harder and slower work to improve existing ones.</p><blockquote><p>几个月前，我与知道联邦政府如何工作以及任何活着的人进行对话。我问他，如果他看到特朗普这样做，他最让他担心。他告诉我的是，如果特朗普慢慢走，他最担心。 If he began his term by doing things that made him more popular and made his opposition weaker and more confused.如果他试图为中期增强力量，同时慢慢扩大自己的力量并在最弱的深处占领。</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s the optimistic take — Trump and his new administration are trying to manically (or is it maniacally?) punch their way to a first-round knockout. They&#39;re utterly unprepared for a 15-round grueling slog. The pessimistic take is that the first-round knockout might happen.</p><p> The ultimate power in America isn&#39;t our political or legal systems. It&#39;s our culture. Our collective attitudes. We, collectively, are quite obviously very bad at history, because we, collectively, clearly forgot how chaotic a Trump presidency is <em>after just four years</em> , and we forgot how much we dislike chaotic leadership. But <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">we know what we don&#39;t like</a> and we&#39;re vocal about it.

<p>Interesting <a href="https://wholesome.computer/@mattpat/113921289516156105">detail</a> with the latest update to Apple&#39;s app for learning and tinkering with Swift: it&#39;s now named Playground, singular, not Playgrounds, plural.

<p>Parker Ortolani:</p><blockquote><p> Mastodon clients have become the new UI playground in the same way that Twitter clients used to be. But what I can&#39;t wrap my head around is the business decision of developers to lean into Mastodon clients versus Bluesky ones. Fortunately some progress seems to be starting to be made with apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740792786">PinkSky</a> that replicate the Instagram experience but using Bluesky as the backend. There are also a handful of clients like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6466340923">Skeets</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graysky-a-bluesky-client/id6448234181">GraySky</a> , but nothing that approaches the quality of some Mastodon clients or the legendary Twitter clients of old. They&#39;re okay, but they&#39;re not worth dropping the official client. Other apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1666230916">OpenVibe</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485">Reeder</a> are designed to combine feeds from multiple services and they do work with Bluesky. But they&#39;re not dedicated clients. I want Tweetbot or Twitterrific, but for Bluesky. I&#39;m not seeing that yet. The opportunity is clearly there, it has tens of millions of users making it three times the size of Mastodon.</p></blockquote><p> One thing all the existing nascent Bluesky clients lack is timeline position saving/sync — so when you leave the app and come back later (with sync, even on a different device) you can pick up reading exactly where you left off. I find it hard to imagine paying for a Bluesky client that didn&#39;t do this.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> About a month ago, Skeets developer Sebastian Vogelsang <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skeetsapp.com/post/3lfa32kfctc26">posted a thread about running into API limitations</a> trying to implement position-saving, a feature that&#39;s in beta, and available to Skeets Pro users.

<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">Editors note from The New Republic</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As The New Republic <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/191007/la-times-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trump">reported on Friday</a> , The Los Angeles Times — currently in a race to the bottom <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/188445/washington-post-bezos-trump-failure">with The Washington Post</a> to determine which of the two venerable institutions can sell out to Donald Trump the hardest — found itself in a fresh controversy after contributor Eric Reinhart accused the paper of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">making significant edits</a> to a piece of his that was largely critical of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. into one that depicted the president&#39;s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services with an “optimistic tone,” largely “suggesting that the virulent conspiracy theorist could be an answer and solution to the American public&#39;s bubbling resentment toward the health care industry.”</p><p> Reinhart exposed the shady goings-on on X (fka Twitter). “Editing out the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author&#39;s clear intent is pretty shitty,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericreinhart.bsky.social/post/3lh2ell45722u">he wrote</a> .鉴于这种可悲的新闻不当行为，新共和国已经同意在他打算阅读的情况下运行赖因哈特的作品。</p></blockquote><p> Reinhart&#39;s headline at TNR, encapsulating the intended thrust of his piece: “ <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">RFK Jr&#39;s Wrecking Ball Won&#39;t Fix Public Health</a> ”, and the closing paragraph of the column:</p><blockquote><p> Although RFK, Jr., and Luigi Mangione are both responses to the same underlying problem of US healthcare corruption, there is a major difference between them: one allegedly operated outside the law to kill one person in defense of millions, whereas the other — via his egomaniacal <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">disregard</a> for scientific evidence — seeks to use law itself to inflict preventable death on those millions.</p></blockquote><p> The headline the LA Times ran his piece under, after their editing: “ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">Trump&#39;s Healthcare Disruption Could Pay Off — if He Pushes Real Reform</a> ”, and its closing paragraphs:</p><blockquote><p> Such an approach would shift us away from overreliance on expensive medical treatments and toward public health as it should be: a project by and for <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/152/4/245/118232/Empowering-the-Extra-Ordinary">the people</a> that makes full use of government resources to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/02/24/fixing-public-health-systems-revolution-physicians-take-backseat/">empower communities</a> .</p><p> We should demand fundamental transformations in how we approach health in America, but a wrecking ball alone won&#39;t deliver what we need.</p></blockquote><p> After all the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post">shenanigans</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/owner-patrick-soon-shiong-is-tanking-the-la-times">Soon-Shiong began pulling</a> pre- <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/soon-shiong-la-times">and post-election</a> , my only question here is whether Reinhart really believed the LA Times op-ed page was going to run his piece as written.</p><h2> Super-Nerdy Bonus Material</h2><p> My original intention for this post ended above. I wanted to quote the TNR editors note that explained the situation, quote Reinhart&#39;s intended headline and closing paragraph, and contrast those with the benign gibberish headline and closing that the LA Times actually published.完毕。但是我还有更多。 Turns out, the LA Times itself effectively published <em>proof</em> of its “editing” that completely perverted Reinhart&#39;s intended thrust.</p><p> I have a small arsenal of homegrown tools I use to automate the work of writing DF. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> itself is the crown jewel of them. But over the now many years I&#39;ve been doing this I&#39;ve created a whole toolbox of scripts and macros that help me do what I do faster and with fewer errors. (And I still commit plenty of errors.) One of the smaller ones that I&#39;ve never shared publicly (but probably <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/">should</a> ) is a Keyboard Maestro macro that lets me select a range of text in Safari and copy that selection as Markdown-formatted文本。 It picks up spans of italics and boldfacing, but most importantly, it picks up hyperlinks in the original text and converts them to the Markdown link style I prefer ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">defined reference links</a> ).</p><p> You will note in my blockquote above of Reinhart&#39;s intended closing paragraph, as published at The New Republic, he linked the word “disregard” to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">this January 28 report from The Washington Post</a> : “RFK Jr. Disparaged Vaccines Dozens of Times in Recent Years and对种族提出了毫无根据的主张”。与《华盛顿邮报》报道的链接在洛杉矶时报中运行的雷恩哈特作品的屠宰版本中没有链接。</p><p> But, my “Copy Markdown Blockquote” macro picked up an effectively invisible-to-the-user link to that article, in the HTML markup between their closing paragraph and Reinhart&#39;s author bio beneath it. You can view source at the LA Times website and see for yourself, but here&#39;s a screenshot:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/la-times-reinhart-html-screenshot.png" class="noborder"><img

[...] Rosen goes on to say that Meta “will take appropriate action, including termination” if it identifies leakers and that “we recently terminated relationships with employees who leaked confidential company information inappropriately and exfiltrated sensitive documents.”</p><p> During today&#39;s all-hands meeting, Zuckerberg told employees he would no longer be as transparent due to leaks. “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks,” he said. “It sucks.”</p></blockquote><p>几乎每一家良好且成功的公司，我都知道火灾泄漏者。 Or really it&#39;s the opposite: it&#39;s difficult to succeed as a company with no institutional trust between employees. But company cultures are infused by the personalities of their founders. Meta employees have no scruples surrounding the privacy of internal communications because, by definition, they&#39;re the sort of people who never saw any problem with Meta&#39;s complete lack of regard for such things. So they don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lgykn4gqmk2v">leak what they don&#39;t like</a> . Zuck gets no loyalty because he hired an entire company of people with no convictions other than “winning” or whatever it really is that Meta sees as its central tenet.</p><p> It&#39;s not fear of getting fired that keeps employees at most companies from leaking.这是他们发现自己与公司的使命保持一致。 They feel like part of a team that they want to see succeed, and they naturally adopt an attitude of being a team player. Team players don&#39;t leak the playbook because they don&#39;t like the coach&#39;s play-calling or how much playing time they&#39;re getting.我从来没有感觉到这种态度存在于元中。</p><p> This is a company that bought a popular VPN app (Onavo) and then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat">used it to snoop on users&#39; encrypted SnapChat traffic</a> . They used it <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/10/facebook-copycatting">to snoop on users to determine the popularity of WhatsApp before purchasing it</a> . This wasn&#39;t some rogue operation in a corner of the company — it was a core strategic asset that led directly to a $20 billion acquisition. Onavo was just flat-out spyware and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/22/facebook-onavo-app-store">Apple kicked it out of the App Store in 2018</a> . For years — years — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/29/facebook-teens-vpn">Meta paid users aged 13–35 up to $20 a month to install a “Facebook Research” app</a> that let Meta study every single thing they did on their phones.

<p>Annie Linskey and Rebecca Ballhaus, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p><blockquote><p>参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦（Elizabeth Warren）（马萨诸塞州D.）在一份声明中说：“这看起来像是贿赂和向每个公司的信号。” “After Meta pays to play, what does Mark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?”</p><p> Serious talks about the suit, which had seen little activity since fall 2023, began after Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s chief executive, flew to Trump&#39;s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to dine with him in November, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The dinner was one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the relationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump&#39;s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump warned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the election against him.</p><p>人民说，在11月晚餐结束时，特朗普提出了诉讼问题。一位人士说，总统表明，必须在扎克伯格“带入帐篷里”之前解决诉讼。</p></blockquote><p>很好地提醒您，自尊心没有价格标签。</p><blockquote><p> Weeks later, in early January, Zuckerberg returned to Mar-a-Lago for a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerberg-meta-trump-pivot-392e4a3f?mod=article_inline">full day of mediation</a> . Trump was present for part of the session, though he stepped out at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-sentencing-hush-money-new-york-9f9282bc?mod=article_inline">one point to be sentenced</a> — appearing virtually — for covering up hush money paid to a porn star, one of the people said.

<p>NBC News, “Meta Agrees to Pay $25 Million to Settle Trump Lawsuit”:</p><blockquote><p> Meta said Wednesday it would pay $25 million to settle a four-year-old lawsuit from President Donald Trump over the social media company&#39;s decision to suspend Trump&#39;s accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.</p><p> Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, filed a notice of the settlement in federal court in San Francisco, where the lawsuit was pending.

<p>Via David Smith on Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113923389557198608">who writes</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The recent work I&#39;ve been doing has required a lot of sharing files between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the ideal tool for this but I&#39;ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p><p> Instead I&#39;ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop alternative and it&#39;s been working fantastically. The only real downside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the share to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that&#39;s a tradeoff I&#39;ll happily make.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow I&#39;d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It&#39;s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229">in the App Store</a> and <a href="https://localsend.org/download">via the web</a> . No middleman in the cloud — transfers are peer-to-peer, and the whole project is <a href="https://localsend.org/community">open source with an active community on GitHub</a> .</p><p> When I dick around with my Android burner phone, I often find myself sorely missing AirDrop and Continuity. Sometimes I just want to move the contents of my clipboard from one device to the other — LocalSend makes that easier than anything else I&#39;ve seen.</p><p> I&#39;m not even sure Smith&#39;s “downside” is really a downside. I understand why AirDrop works the way it does (always-on in the background), but I wouldn&#39;t want LocalSend to work that way. I <em>like</em> the explicitness of opening it on both devices.</p><p> Just an outstanding project from developer Tien Do Nam. Free of charge, open source, and no ads — the only funding is via an in-app tip jar, which I just gladly dropped some bills in.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘LocalSend: Open Source Cross-Platform Alternative to AirDrop’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/localsend">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Reports Q1 FY2025 Results </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/30/aapl-q1-fy2025" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41532</id><published> 2025-01-31T01:27:48Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T15:00:07Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>苹果：</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter ended December 28, 2024. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10 percent year over year.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">Jason Snell (with his usual assortment of charts)</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Probably most notable is that iPhone revenue was down 1% from the year-ago quarter, which will certainly upset some analysts and investors, given that the iPhone is more than half of Apple&#39;s total revenue. But the Mac jumped 16%, the iPad was up 15%, and services was up 14%. The recently sluggish Wearables, Home, and Accessories category was down 2%.</p></blockquote><p> Sales were down 11 percent in China companywide, which is surely what pulled the iPhone down. Outside China iPhone 16 sales must be very strong. But Apple&#39;s overall sales in China <a href="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/financials-2025-1-4-5-1.png?ssl=1">have been trending down for 3 years now</a> .
