<p>昨天，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-2-spatial-video">苹果发布了 iOS 17.2 的开发者测试版 2</a> ，这是第一个支持使用 iPhone 15 Pro 机型捕捉空间视频的 iOS 版本。今天发布了公开测试版，启用了相同的功能。苹果昨天邀请我去纽约，不仅是预览使用 iPhone 捕捉空间视频，还体验使用 Vision Pro 观看这些空间视频。</p><p>就像我 6 月份在 WWDC 上第一次进行 Vision Pro 演示一样，这次体验令人惊叹。</p><h2>在 iPhone 上捕捉空间视频</h2><p>在 iPhone 15 Pro 上拍摄空间视频非常简单。该功能（至少目前）默认处于禁用状态，可以在“设置”→“相机”→“格式”中启用。该选项被标记为“Apple Vision Pro 的空间视频”，这是恰当的，因为（至少现在）空间视频仅在 Vision Pro 上播放时看起来与非空间视频不同。在任何其他设备上观看时，它看起来就像普通的平面视频。</p><p>启用后，只要处于常规视频模式，您就可以在相机应用程序中切换空间视频捕获。它非常类似于拍摄静态照片时的实时照片切换，或视频的动作模式切换 - 不是相机主水平模式切换器中的单独模式，而是主视频模式中的切换按钮。</p><p>捕捉空间视频时，您无法选择分辨率、帧速率或文件格式。所有空间视频均以 1080p、30 fps 的 HEVC 文件格式捕获。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-11-10"><a href="#fn1-2023-11-10">1</a></sup>您还需要水平握住手机，使两个拍摄镜头处于同一平面。 iPhone 在拍摄空间视频时使用主镜头（1×）和超广角镜头（0.5×）进行捕捉，事实上，苹果改变了 iPhone 15 Pro 上三个镜头的排列，部分是为了支持这一功能。 （在之前的 iPhone Pro 机型上，水平握持时，超广角摄像头位于底部，主镜头和长焦镜头位于顶部。）</p><p>我认为分辨率仅限于 1080p，因为要从超宽 0.5× 相机获取与主 1× 相机相同视场的图像，需要大幅裁剪超宽图像。超广角相机只有 12 MP 传感器，因此没有足够的像素来从传感器中心裁剪 1 倍等效视野并获得 4K 图像。</p><p>使用 iPhone 拍摄空间视频有两个缺点。首先，前面提到的 1080p 分辨率和 30 fps 帧速率。多年来我一直默认拍摄 4K 视频，为什么不呢？我希望我们能够捕捉 4K 的空间视频，但遗憾的是，目前还没有。拍摄空间视频的第二个缺点是，与非空间 1080p 相比，它实际上使文件大小增加了一倍，原因很明显，每个空间视频包含两个 1080p 视频流。文件大小加倍只是一个很小的代价——视频仍然小于非空间 4K 30 fps 视频。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-11-10"><a href="#fn2-2023-11-10">2</a></sup></p><p>确实，在 iPhone 上捕捉空间视频没什么大不了的。如果切换按钮关闭，您可以使用所有常规选项的分辨率 (720p/1080p/4K) 和帧速率 (24/30/60) 捕获常规视频。如果空间视频的开关处于打开状态（打开时为黄色，不可能错过），您将失去这些选择，但它看起来就像捕捉普通视频一样。当您播放它或与在手机或计算机等常规设备上观看它的其他人分享它时，它看起来就像一个普通的平面视频。</p><p>如果您拥有 iPhone 15 Pro，那么今年没有充分的理由不开始捕捉空间视频（例如这个假期），以记录您可能想要体验的“回忆”的任何时刻。未来的Vision耳机，即使你明年不打算购买第一代Vision Pro。</p><h2>在 Vision Pro 上查看空间视频</h2><p>在演示之前，我向 Apple 提供了我的眼镜处方，并且我使用的 Vision Pro 耳机配备了适当的矫正镜片。与我六月份的演示一样，我通过耳机看到的一切看起来都非常清晰。</p><p>自 6 月份以来，Apple 显着改进并简化了入门/校准流程。在几个步骤中，您会看到一系列漂浮在您面前的大圆圈中的点，就像时钟上的小时索引一样。当您查看每个圆圈时，它会亮起一点，然后您会做出手指点击手势。 Vision Pro 采用这种方式来校准它认为您正在查看的内容就是您实际正在查看的内容。校准步骤完成后（只花了一两分钟）我就准备好进入 VisionOS 的主屏幕了。 （而且这种校准的精确度是惊人的——UI 元素可以放置得相对靠近，并且它准确地知道你在点击时正在看哪一个。iOS UI 设计需要比我们相对较粗的指尖更加宽容。 VisionOS UI 设计需要考虑到我们视线的精确度。）</p><p>我昨天的演示明确限于一般摄影，特别是空间视频，因此，根据 Apple 的要求，我的演示仅限于 VisionOS 中的照片应用程序。有时，我很想看看我还能去哪里、还能做什么。但仅在“照片”中就有太多可看可做的事情，以至于我的演示（佩戴 Vision Pro 总共大约 30 分钟）很快就过去了。</p><p>在我们使用 Vision Pro 将我们分开在较小的房间里之前，我与《华尔街日报》的乔安娜·斯特恩 (Joanna Stern) 配对，简要介绍了使用 iPhone 15 Pro 进行空间视频捕捉的细节。我们每人都获得了一部演示版 iPhone，并被允许拍摄我们自己的空间视频。我们在一个宽敞的现代高天花板厨房里，沐浴在大窗户的自然光中。一位厨师正在忙着准备寿司，并充当我们拍摄的模特。当然，乔安娜和我在互相拍摄的同时也拍摄了彼此的镜头。这是非常元的。我们自己拍摄的镜头随后被预加载到我们用于演示的相应 Vision Pro 耳机上。</p><p>我们不被允许在 Vision Pro 上捕捉空间视频。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-11-10"><a href="#fn3-2023-11-10">3</a></sup>然而，我们的演示设备的照片库中有一个在 Vision Pro 上拍摄的视频 — 我之前在 6 月份经历过一段视频，内容是一群二十多岁的年轻人晚上围坐在火坑旁，在篝火旁玩耍。寒冷的气氛。还有其他几个由 Apple 拍摄的空间视频，这些视频是使用 iPhone 15 Pro 拍摄的。</p><p>一个明显的问题是：使用 iPhone 15 Pro 拍摄的空间视频与使用 Vision Pro 本身拍摄的空间视频有何不同？鉴于苹果只提供了一个在 Vision Pro 上拍摄的空间视频示例，我觉得根据我昨天的经历，我无法完全回答这个问题。差异似乎并不显着或显着。我体验过的使用 iPhone 15 Pro 拍摄的空间视频，包括我自己拍摄的视频，看起来与使用 Vision Pro 拍摄的视频一样出色。</p><p>苹果不会直接说出来，但我确实感觉到，综合考虑，使用 Vision Pro 捕捉的空间视频会“更好”。 iPhone 可能会在图像质量上胜出，因为 iPhone 15 Pro 上的 1× 主摄像头是苹果制造的最好的相机系统，但 Vision Pro 应该会在空间感（ <em>3D 性）</em>上胜出，因为 Vision Pro 的两个用于空间视频捕捉的镜头彼此之间的距离大致与人眼的距离一样远。当然，iPhone 上用于拍摄的两个镜头之间的距离比人眼的距离要近得多。但是，尽管两个镜头彼此距离有多近，但在 iPhone 上拍摄的空间视频中，3D 效果仍然<em>非常</em>引人注目。不知怎的，它看起来既非常自然又完全不可思议。</p><p>观看它们的效果令人惊叹，体验非凡。因此，总的来说，iPhone 将成为空间视频的“最佳”捕捉设备——即使 Vision Pro 捕捉的镜头在技术上更优越——因为，正如古老的格言所说，最好的相机就是你拥有的相机与你。我几乎到处都带着 iPhone。对于明年的 Vision Pro 来说，这一点永远不会接近真实。</p><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos">以下是我在 6 月份第一次实践 Vision Pro 后写的关于空间视频的文章</a>：</p><blockquote><p>空间照片和视频（使用 Vision Pro 本身拍摄的照片和视频）被视为 2D 内容和完全沉浸式 3D 内容之间的混合体。它们不会出现在明确定义的矩形中。相反，它们的周围有一层朦胧的梦幻般的边界。就像哈利波特电影中的某种隐形传送魔法咒语之类的。这种效果让我想起史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格的<em>《少数派报告》</em> ，汤姆·克鲁斯饰演的角色<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">会着迷地观看他儿子的“记忆”</a> ，以及通灵的“预知者”感知即将发生的谋杀的幻象。这就像观看一个梦，但通过一个门户打开了另一个世界。</p></blockquote><p>当您使用 Vision Pro 观看常规（非空间）视频或查看常规静态摄影时，图像会出现在您面前的清晰定义的窗口中。空间视频根本不是这样的。今天我无法比六月更好地描述它：这就像观看和聆听一个梦，通过一个朦胧的边界门户打开了另一个世界。</p><p>有几个因素造成了这种梦幻般的感觉。空间视频看起来并不<em>真实</em>。看起来或感觉起来这些拍摄对象并不真实地出现在您面前。您在 Vision Pro 中看到的实时直通视频以及您周围的真实世界<em>都是</em>如此。真实现实的直通视频是如此引人注目、如此逼真，以至于在我迄今为止的两次演示体验中，我忘记了我总是在我眼前的屏幕上观看视频，而不仅仅是用我的护目镜观看。眼睛对我周围世界的看法。</p><p>因此 Vision Pro 能够呈现看起来完全真实的视频 - 因为这正是直通视频的工作原理和感觉。录制的空间视频有所不同。一方面，现实不是 30 fps，也不是只有 1080p。这使得空间视频本身看起来并不低分辨率或粗糙，而更像电影。升级后的 1080p 图像呈现出电影般的颗粒感，明显低于现实的帧速率也传达出电影般的感觉。当然，更高的分辨率看起来会更好，但我不确定更高的帧速率会更好。电影和电视的魅力之一在于 24 和 30 fps 的镜头具有梦幻般的效果。</p><p>然而，您在屏幕上看过的任何内容都无法让您为观看这些空间视频的体验做好准备，尤其是那些您自己、家人和朋友拍摄的视频。它们确实更像是回忆而不是视频。我昨天体验的由苹果拍摄的空间视频看起来<em>更好</em>——由专业摄影师拍摄，并由专业演员出演。但我自己开枪的那些更引人注目，让我惊叹不已。我的朋友乔安娜就在我面前，就像我可以伸手触摸她一样，但那是 30 分钟前，在另一个房间。</p><p>当你经历这种情况时，准备好在情感上被感动吧。</p><h2>全景照片和静态照片</h2><p>我昨天的简报和演示体验主要是关于在 iPhone 15 Pro 上捕捉空间视频并在 Vision Pro 上观看，但我的演示经历了 VisionOS 中的整个照片应用体验。</p><p>普通的旧静态照片看起来<em>棒极了</em>。您可以将查看照片的虚拟窗口的大小调整为您实际需要的大小。这不仅仅是像拥有一个 20 英尺的显示器——其尺寸更接近于电影院屏幕而不是电视。这就像拥有一个具有视网膜质量分辨率的 20 英尺显示器，以及您使用过的任何显示器中最好的亮度和清晰度。我花了很多时间在 iPhone 显示屏上查看自己用 iPhone 拍摄的静态照片，很难相信它们放大到广告牌般的尺寸后看起来会有多好。只是用 iPhone 拍摄的普通静态照片。</p><p>然后还有全景照片。苹果公司在 2012 年推出 iPhone 5 时首次引入了全景模式。这个功能给我的印象从来没有比“一个很酷的技巧”更好的了。自该功能推出以来的十年里，我只使用了大约 200 个。当在平面显示器上观看时，它们看起来太不自然，光学扭曲太多。而且你把它们做得越全景，当平面观看时它们看起来就越不自然。</p><p>使用 Vision Pro 查看的全景照片令人惊叹。</p><p>完全没有光学畸变，没有鱼眼效果。看起来就像您站在拍摄全景照片的地方一样，拍摄时的全景视野越宽，播放体验就越引人注目。这太不可思议了，现在我希望在过去的 10 年里我能学到更多这样的东西。</p><p>作为基本规则，今后我计划拍摄<em>人们</em>的空间视频，尤其是我的家人和最亲爱的朋友，以及我访问过的<em>地方</em>的全景照片。这就像隐形传送。</p><h2>杂项观察</h2><p>Vision Pro 体验高度依赖于<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveated_rendering">注视点渲染</a>，维基百科将其简单地描述为“一种渲染技术，它使用与虚拟现实耳机集成的眼动追踪器，通过大幅降低周边视觉（在视觉之外）的图像质量来减少渲染工作量。中央凹注视的区域）。”我们的视网膜也是这样工作的——我们实际上只能清晰地看到落在视网膜中心黄斑上的东西。 Vision Pro 实际上只能以高分辨率渲染我们直接注视的内容。其余部分的分辨率较低，但这不是问题，因为当您转移视线时，Vision Pro 更新显示的速度非常快。</p><p>昨天我注意到，如果我将目光从一侧足够快地转移到另一侧，我就能捕捉到它更新的注视点。就在最短暂的时刻，您可能会以不太完美的分辨率捕获某些内容。我认为。它追踪你的目光并更新显示的速度是如此之快，我无法确定。然而，整体效果的细节和高分辨率令人难以置信。昨天我的演示仅限于照片应用程序，但我比以往任何时候都更有信心，Vision Pro 将成为一款出色的阅读和写作设备 - 因此，好吧，<em>工作</em>。</p><p>耳机带中扬声器的音质令人印象深刻。 Vision Pro 的视觉体验是如此引人注目——我的意思是，该产品的名称中含有“Vision”是有原因的——音频体验很容易被忽视，但它非常好。</p><p>通过凝视和手指点击来导航 VisionOS 是如此自然。我使用 Vision Pro 总共花了大约一个小时，分为两个 30 分钟的演示，但我已经对使用该操作系统感到很自在了。这是一种非常自然的交互模型，仅基于您所看到的内容。我对这个平台以及空间计算的未来充满热情。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-11-10"><p> HEVC 规范允许单个文件包含多个视频流。这就是苹果正在做的事情，用元数据描述哪个流是“左”，哪个流是“右”。 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/HEVC-Stereo-Video-Profile.pdf">Apple 早在 6 月 WWDC 结束后就发布了此格式的初步文档</a>。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-11-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-11-10"><p>根据苹果公司的说法，这些是每分钟视频的平均文件大小：</p><p> • 常规 1080p 30 fps：65 MB<br /> • 空间 1080p 30 fps：130 MB<br /> • 常规 4K 30 fps：190 MB <a href="#fnr2-2023-11-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-11-10"><p>释义：</p><p> “这是数字王冠。今天您将使用它来通过旋转它来调整沉浸感，如果您需要返回主屏幕，您可以按下表冠。另一侧是用于使用 Vision Pro 拍摄照片或视频的按钮。我们今天不会使用那个按钮。”</p><p> “但是那个按钮有用吗？如果我按下那个按钮，它会拍摄照片或视频吗？”</p><p> “请不要按那个按钮。” <a href="#fnr3-2023-11-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 3。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Vision Pro、空间视频和全景照片</title></entry><entry><title>“iOS 17.2 暗示从 App Store 外部侧载应用程序” </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/10/ios-17-2-sideload-apps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v4v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/10/ios-17-sideloading" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40351</id><published> 2023-11-10T21:44:12Z</published><updated> 2023-11-10T22:26:18Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

With their support, however, he is an ongoing menace to the entire democratic order of the United States.

<p>I&#39;m glad that two weeks ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_pencil_usb-c" title="There's a New Apple Pencil With a USB-C Port, and My Thoughts Turn to the Complexity of the Overall iPad Lineup">I griped about the complexity of the current iPad lineup</a> . Three Pencils that are compatible with a complicated matrix of iPad models. iPad Pro models with the front-facing camera on the short side, but a 10th-generation non-pro iPad that&#39;s been updated with a front-facing camera on the long side, where pro users want it. It&#39;s a jumble.</p><p> I&#39;m glad because now I have something to point to as a counterexample, a broad product lineup that is, with the introduction of the M3 family of chips, nearly perfect: MacBooks. Here&#39;s how I see Apple&#39;s lineup: <sup id="fnr1-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn1-2023-11-06">1</a></sup></p><ul><li> <strong>Budget:</strong> 13-inch M1 MacBook Air: $999</li><li> <strong>Consumer:</strong> M2 MacBook Air:<ul><li> 13-inch: $1,100</li><li> 15-inch: $1,300</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Pro Jr.:</strong> 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro: $1600</li><li> <strong>Professional Pro:</strong> M3 Pro MacBook Pro<ul><li> 14-inch: $2,000</li><li> 16-inch: $2,500</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Workstation-Class:</strong> M3 Max MacBook Pro<ul><li> 14-inch: $3,200</li><li> 16-inch: $3,500</li></ul></li></ul><p> This lineup is clear, crisp, and good. MacBook Airs in the $1,000–$2,000 range; MacBook Pros with M3 Pro in the $2,000–$3,000 range, and MacBook Pros with the M3 Max in the $3,000– <em>$yowza</em> range. (A maxed-out 16-inch MBP with M3 Max (16-core CPU, 40-core GPU), 128 GB RAM, and 8 TB SSD costs $7,200.)</p><p> The wildcard in Apple&#39;s MacBook lineup is what I&#39;m cheekily calling the “Pro Jr.” model. For the last few years, that&#39;s been the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar — a laptop that most expert users thought shouldn&#39;t even exist, but which Apple has stated was the company&#39;s second-best-selling laptop. There are a <em>lot</em> of buyers who want a MacBook Pro, even if they don&#39;t need — or want to pay for — truly professional performance specs.</p><p> With the introduction last week of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the regular M3 chip, Apple has fixed this tier. I often note that Apple means several different things when it describes a product as “pro” — it sometimes means <em>professional</em> , but sometimes means <em>nicer</em> or <em>better</em> . The regular M3 MacBook Pro exemplifies this latter meaning. It has the same industry-best 14-inch display as its M3 Pro and M3 Max siblings, the same excellent 6-speaker sound system, and the same modern form factor. It is, by all appearances, a MacBook worthy of the name “MacBook Pro” heading into 2024. <sup id="fnr2-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn2-2023-11-06">2</a></sup></p><p> One key difference between the new 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro and the 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro it replaces in the lineup is price: the 13-inch M2 MBP started at $1,300; the new 14-inch M3 MBP starts at $1,600. That&#39;s a significant jump, but it makes sense. First, the new-ish 15-inch M2 MacBook Air — introduced this year at WWDC in June — now occupies the “starts at $1,300” tier in the price matrix. Second, it <em>is</em> named “Pro”.</p><h2> The M3 Pro and M3 Max</h2><p> With the M1 and M2 generations of Apple Silicon, consumer-level Macs debuted months ahead of the professional models with the Pro and Max (and for desktop systems, Ultra) variants of the chips:</p><ul><li><p> The M1 chips debuted in November 2020 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/introducing-the-next-generation-of-mac/">with the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini</a> . These Macs all had unchanged form factors from their Intel-chip predecessors.</p></li><li><p> The M1 Pro and Max, along with the new 14- and 16-inch “notched display” form factors, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-m1-pro-and-m1-max-the-most-powerful-chips-apple-has-ever-built/">debuted almost a year later in October 2021</a> .</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/07/all-new-macbook-air-with-m2-available-to-order-starting-friday-july-8/">The M2 chip debuted in July 2022, in the new-form-factor 13-inch MacBook Air</a> . That M2 chip also appeared in the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar at the same time.</p></li><li><p> The M2 Pro and Max <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/01/apple-unveils-macbook-pro-featuring-m2-pro-and-m2-max/">debuted in updated 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros (along with the M2 Pro in a Mac Mini) in January of 2023</a> . The general consensus is that these machines were late, and were originally intended for late 2022, but the fact is they shipped in January this year.</p></li></ul><p> So with the M1 generation, the Pro and Max models shipped almost a year after the plain M1. With the M2&#39;s, the Pro and Max models shipped about 6 months after the plain M2.</p><p> Now, with the M3 generation, the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max debuted alongside each other, and the plain M3 is debuting <em>only</em> in the new $1,600 “Pro Jr.” 14-inch MacBook Pro. All things considered, this makes sense: you&#39;d think that the first laptops to get a new generation of chips would be the premium ones, not the consumer-priced ones. I suspect that what we saw with the M1 and M2 generations was a byproduct of Apple silicon being new — that the nature of launching a new PC chip architecture was such that Apple went with the “easier” chips first, the “harder” chips after. But now that they&#39;ve been around this block a few times, having successfully bootstrapped an entirely new PC architecture, they&#39;ve reached the point where they&#39;re able to lead with their most important M-series chips: pro chips for pro MacBooks.</p><p> I expect that we&#39;ll see M3 MacBook Airs in the spring, either at a special event in March or April, or at WWDC. <sup id="fnr3-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn3-2023-11-06">3</a></sup> And that&#39;s probably the same time we&#39;ll see the desktop lineup — Mini, Studio, and Pro — move to the M3 series as well. (Even if the M3 Ultra is “just” two M3 Maxes bridged together, that should be a pretty good chip, with up to 32 CPU cores, 80 GPU cores, and a RAM cap of 256 GB. If the M3 Ultra is <em>more</em> than that... get your popcorn.)</p><p> Further, I think this will be the pattern henceforth, for the M4, M5, and future generations: MacBook Pros first, then MacBook Airs and desktops after. It simply makes more sense marketing-wise. The MacBook Pros are the performance-optimized laptops, and pro laptops far outsell pro desktops.</p><p> With the M1 and M2 generations, the Pro chip was basically half of a Max chip. That&#39;s not true with the M3 chips. In broad strokes, the M3 Pro is more like a beefed up regular M3, and the M3 Max is a different beast entirely. Looking at CPUs, split by performance and efficiency cores, here are the best configurations for each chip:</p><ul><li> M3: 4/4</li><li> M3 Pro: 6/6</li><li> M3 Max: 12/4</li></ul><p> The M3 Pro models are geared toward what I think is the sweet spot for MacBook Pro buyers, with a balance between performance and efficiency cores. The M3 Max models are clearly geared toward professionals who demand the highest performance available. 16 total CPU cores doesn&#39;t sound like that many more than 12, but the M3 Max cores aren&#39;t split evenly between performance and efficiency — they&#39;re skewed heavily toward performance cores.</p><p> There are also lesser (presumably, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/glossary-binning-definition,5892.html">binned</a> ) variants of the M3 Pro (11 total CPU cores: 5 performance cores/6 efficiency; 14-core GPU) and M3 Max (14 total CPU cores: 10 performance, 4 efficiency; 30-core GPU). And the RAM options for all of these chips vary, both in bandwidth and capacity:</p><ul><li> <strong>M3:</strong> 2 RAM chips, 100 GB/s memory bandwidth:<ul><li> 2 × 4 GB = 8 GB</li><li> 2 × 8 GB = 16 GB</li><li> 2 × 12 GB = 24 GB</li></ul></li><li> <strong>M3 Pro:</strong> 3 RAM chips, 150 GB/s memory bandwidth:<ul><li> 3 × 6 GB = 18 GB</li><li> 3 × 12 GB = 36 GB</li></ul></li><li> <strong>M3 Max with 14-core CPU:</strong> 3 RAM chips, 300 GB/s memory bandwidth:<ul><li> 3 × 12 GB = 36 GB</li><li> 3 × 32 GB = 96 GB</li></ul></li><li> <strong>M3 Max with 16-core CPU:</strong> 4 RAM chips, 400 GB/s memory bandwidth:<ul><li> 4 × 12 GB = 48 GB</li><li> 4 × 16 GB = 64 GB</li><li> 4 × 32 GB = 128 GB</li></ul></li></ul><p> Those RAM options also make clear that the M3 Pro is more like a beefed-up regular M3, and the M3 Max a different beast. The M3 Pro offers options with a little more RAM that&#39;s 1.5× faster than the baseline M3. The M3 Max offers options with a <em>lot</em> more RAM that&#39;s 3× or 4× faster.</p><p> At first it might seem overwhelming to see that the “M3 family of MacBook Pros” supports RAM tiers of 8, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 64, 96, and a whopping 128 GB of RAM. But once you zero in on a specific CPU, you&#39;ve really only got two or three choices for RAM. My only complaints about RAM:</p><ul><li><p> It would be nice if the base M3 model started at 16 GB, not 8 GB. 8 GB doesn&#39;t feel “pro” in any sense of the word. But we can&#39;t ignore Apple&#39;s profit margins and the siren song, marketing-wise, of hitting lower price points. Keeping the profit margins the same but bumping the base RAM to 16 GB would mean the entry model would start at $1,800; keeping the price at $1,600 but bumping the RAM to 16 GB would eat significantly into the margins for that model — which model, again, is Apple&#39;s second-best-selling Mac. We all love to spend Tim Cook&#39;s money, but he&#39;s the one who&#39;s been running the most profitable company in the world for over a decade. If you&#39;re offended by a mere 8 GB of RAM, pony up the extra $200.</p></li><li><p> I personally fall into the category where my number one performance need is RAM, because I tend to keep open dozens of apps and hundreds of Safari tabs. In terms of my CPU and GPU needs, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d notice the difference between an M3 Pro and M3 Max. But to get a shitload of RAM (that&#39;s a computer science term), you need to buy an M3 Max model. I wish the M3 Pro had at least one more RAM configuration, say, 3 × 16 GB = 48 GB. That would still leave the 64-GB-and-up configurations to the M3 Max, but would be a nice option for people whose biggest power-user need is RAM.</p></li></ul><p> None of these extreme options come cheap. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the 16-core M3 Max and 40-core GPU starts at $3,700; the 16-inch model with the same chip starts at a cool $4,000. The <em>base</em> RAM for that chip is 48 GB — which is double the <em>maximum</em> RAM of the regular M3. Upgrading from 48 to 64 GB RAM costs $200 (a veritable pittance for a roughly $4,000 computer); upgrading from 48 to 128 GB, though, costs $1,000.</p><h2> Performance</h2><p> I&#39;ve spent the last five days testing a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max, with the 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 64 GB RAM, and a 2 TB SSD. That&#39;s a $4,300 configuration. Not cheap, but you really do get what you pay for: this machine absolutely screams.</p><p> My favorite benchmark is <a href="https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.1/">the browser-based Speedometer</a> (currently version 2.1). Web browser rendering is surprisingly resource-intensive — partially because modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript are remarkably complex, and partially because most web developers are remarkably untalented and careless programmers. <sup id="fnr4-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn4-2023-11-06">4</a></sup> Javascript is a single-threaded language, and so web browser rendering is inherently bound to the single-core performance of your CPU. Multi-core performance is important, but for most tasks for most users, single-core performance is more important. Speedometer measures that.

I suspect Cinebench&#39;s 2.7× difference will prove more representative of real-world results, but that&#39;s just a hunch. But it seems fair to say that the M3 Max — and the M3 generation overall — is “faster enough”. These are very solid improvements from comparable MacBook Pros in just two years.</p><p> Apple&#39;s own marketing materials make several points of comparison to Intel-based Macs, which is where the new MacBook Pros truly shine. That&#39;s not entirely fair to Intel, the company, because Intel&#39;s laptop chips have, of course, gotten faster since Apple last shipped new Macs equipped with them in 2019. But it&#39;s completely relevant to all Mac users still using Intel-based Macs, who, according to people I&#39;ve spoken with at Apple, remain a majority of the Mac user base. The upgrade cycle for Macs is long — more like that for cars, than for phones. Those Mac users who&#39;ve held off on upgrading to Apple silicon hardware are in for a treat when they do.</p><p> I will note that the only time I&#39;ve heard fan noise from the M3 Max MacBook Pro was while running Cinebench&#39;s benchmarks. The machine was warm, not hot, but the fan was definitely audible. Cinebench&#39;s are long-running benchmarks, each taking 10 minutes. In actual usage, I haven&#39;t heard the fans even once, as usual for an Apple silicon Mac.</p><h2> Space Black</h2><p> My review unit is, unsurprisingly and thankfully, space black — a new color option that is only available with the M3 Pro and M3 Max models. All of the new M3-series MacBook Pros are available in silver, but the dark option for the regular M3 models is the same old space gray.</p><p> Apple&#39;s product photography is very fair in terms of accurately conveying just how dark this “space black” is — which, despite its name, is a very dark gray, not black. Why not <em>black</em> black, though? Apple has made plenty of aluminum devices that are truly black. The iPhone 7 — <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/09/apple-introduces-iphone-7-iphone-7-plus/">available in both glossy jet black and matte black</a> — comes to mind. I can only presume that this is the darkness that Apple thinks looks best for a MacBook Pro — that any darker would look worse, overall. There&#39;s a part of me that would like to see it even darker, but this is dark enough that I can believe that even darker would not look better.</p><p> I adore it. My personal Mac is a space gray 14-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro with 64 GB RAM (the maximum RAM allotment for that machine). I have no legitimate performance-related reasons to upgrade to an M3 Max MacBook Pro, but I want to, very much, simply because I crave this space black finish. Side by side, this space black M3 MacBook Pro makes my space gray M1 MacBook Pro look like silver. Space gray MacBooks are merely dark <em>er</em> . Space black, though not black, is actually <em>dark</em> . It&#39;s a superficial aspect, but it matters. If it didn&#39;t, Apple would just make them all silver and call it a day.</p><p> One reason, it seems, that the space <em>gray</em> Apple offered for years, on both MacBooks and iPads, wasn&#39;t darker is that darker shades of anodized aluminum are more prone to showing fingerprints. Visible fingerprints are a common complaint regarding the “midnight” M2 MacBook Airs, for example, which are in fact quite dark. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctkW3V0Mh-k" title="Apple's “Scary Fast” event keynote.">When introducing</a> the new space black option last week, Apple specifically mentioned a new process they&#39;ve developed to reduce the visibility of fingerprints. It is <em>not</em> a coating. It is instead a “breakthrough chemistry” that is part of the anodization process. It doesn&#39;t feel any different at all to the touch, and it really does seem to alleviate the visibility of fingerprints. I&#39;m calling it a legit breakthrough. I&#39;ve not once cleaned this MacBook Pro&#39;s surface since I&#39;ve been using it, and other than some squint-and-you-can-see-them smudges on the palm rest area, there&#39;s not much sign it&#39;s been used.</p><p> Also: the MagSafe power cable is black, and it looks cool as hell. If Darth Vader charged that chest plate dingus with MagSafe, this would be his cable.</p><h2> Conclusion</h2><p> These new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are the best laptops ever made. Not just the best MacBooks, the best laptops, full stop, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even close. They look great and feel great. They have excellent keyboards and the best trackpads in the world. For the power they pack, they&#39;re remarkably thin and light. They&#39;re durable. They offer a great assortment of ports, including three Thunderbolt 4 ports ( <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Pro-14-M3,MacBook-Pro-14-M3x,MacBook-Pro-16-M3">but just two ports on the 14-inch base model</a> — the one with the regular M3 — and those two ports are Thunderbolt/USB 4, not Thunderbolt 4), HDMI out, an SD Card slot, and MagSafe. There is even a very small circular port where you can connect headphones that use a wired connection. The displays are the best in any laptops in the world, with great color accuracy and remarkable brightness. The speaker systems sound too good to be true for laptops.</p><p> That&#39;s all been true for two years now, since the M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pros launched in October 2021.</p><p> Now they&#39;re even better: the M3 family of chips is more than just a speed bump from the M2. Apple has designed three entirely different chips for three different tiers of users. They&#39;re faster at single-core performance, faster at multi-core, and the GPUs introduce three breakthroughs: hardware accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading (new to Apple silicon), and a new memory allocation technique they&#39;re calling Dynamic Caching (new to the industry, so claims Apple). I suspect this explains the extraordinary gain in Cinebench&#39;s GPU benchmark comparing the M3 Max against my very comparable 2021 M1 Max. Apple&#39;s M-series silicon team is simply on fire, doing some of the most impressive work in the history of computer architecture design and engineering. PC laptops in this class <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850863/asus-rog-strix-scar-17-review-qhd-gaming-laptop">weigh over 6.5 pounds</a> and offer terrible battery life; the 16-inch MacBook Pro weighs 4.7–4.8, the 14-inch MacBook Pro just 3.4–3.6, and all offer remarkably long battery life. It&#39;s not like Apple&#39;s silicon team had one breakthrough moment back in 2020 and have since been regressing to the mean — they continue to <em>increase</em> their lead over the rest of the industry in performance-per-watt. The difference between Mac and PC laptop hardware is as vast and stark as the difference between MacOS and Windows software. Perhaps even more so.</p><p> So should you buy one?</p><p> Anyone who bought an M2 MacBook Pro earlier this year: I feel for you. First round of drinks is on me.</p><p> Anyone, like me, who bought an M1 MacBook Pro two years ago: you are right to feel tempted. If you&#39;re hell-bent on keeping your wallet in your pocket and waiting one more generation before upgrading, do not — I repeat, do not — let your eyes fall upon a space black M3 MacBook Pro.</p><p> Anyone still holding onto an Intel-based MacBook Pro: place an order right now, if you haven&#39;t already. I&#39;m jealous of the treat you&#39;re in for when you experience what these premium Apple silicon machines are like to use.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-11-06"><p> My style is to round “x99” prices up, for clarity. I see “$1,100” and I know what it means; I see “1,099” and I need a moment to put it in context, and that context is understanding that it effectively means $1,100. I left the M1 MacBook Air at $999 in the above table because that&#39;s clearly a magic price point — Apple&#39;s only sub-$1,000 MacBook. <a href="#fnr1-2023-11-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-11-06"><p> Pour one out for the Touch Bar, which many Mac users seemingly despised, but which I always had mixed feelings regarding. It wasn&#39;t good enough, that&#39;s clear. I think it needed haptic feedback, for one thing — something that would&#39;ve enabled you to use it by touch alone. The name “Touch Bar” sort of didn&#39;t fit, if you think about it. Yes, it was a touch screen, but unlike the physical keys of a keyboard, there was no way to use it by feel alone. And it wasn&#39;t part of the display — it was part of the <em>keyboard</em> . You had to stare at it to use it. And the lack of a third dimension — buttons you could feel and that needed to be pressed, not just touched, to activate — made it prone to accidental activations. It was worth a try. I genuinely appreciate the ambition of trying something innovative with the F-key row. But it wasn&#39;t good enough and stuck around too long with that “Pro Jr.” 13-inch MacBook Pro. I&#39;d love to see it return someday, with an implementation that somehow offers <em>depth</em> — a third dimension that you can feel and click. Something meant for your fingers, not your eyes. <a href="#fnr2-2023-11-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-11-06"><p> I do not think we will see any M3 chips other than the regular M3 in the next generation of MacBook Air.

It is true, though, that today&#39;s Mac Mini can be configured with an M2 Pro. The difference between the Mac Mini and MacBook Air, though, is cooling. The Mac Mini is relatively spacious and has fans; the MacBook Air is designed to be as thin as possible and has no fans.

Rather, it&#39;s the whole PC market, which is now in a downswing after a huge surge during the early COVID years.</p><p> Services, at $22.3 billion, is now just over half the net sales for iPhone ($43.8 billion). And Mac + iPad + Wearables/etc. combine for $23.3 billion, so Services seems on the cusp of soon eclipsing all non-iPhone hardware combined.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/apple-q4-2023-financial-results-and-charts/">Jason Snell&#39;s usual collection of charts</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Q4 2023 Results’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/02/apple-q4-2023-results">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Dieter Rams Pointing at Things He Doesn&#39;t Like</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypyAg3Zbs_8" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v4b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/02/rams-pointing-at-things-he-doesnt-like" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40331</id><published> 2023-11-02T22:08:16Z</published><updated> 2023-11-02T22:08:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jess Weatherbed, writing for The Verge under the headline “Here&#39;s What Apple Really Means When It Says &#39;Shot on iPhone&#39;”:</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s a neat way to promote the recording quality of iPhone cameras, but it&#39;s not like everyday folks can recreate these kinds of results at home unless they happen to own a shedload of ludicrously expensive equipment. The gear shown in the “Scary Fast” behind-the-scenes footage is fairly standard for big studio productions, but Apple&#39;s implication with these so-called “shot on iPhone” promotions is that anyone can do it if only they buy the newest iPhone.</p></blockquote><p> I saw a few folks mocking Apple for this on Mastodon and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blakersdozen/post/CzENNTQAD6G/">Threads</a> , too. This is ridiculous. Do these people think that previous Apple keynote films were shot with just a single camera person wielding something like a $40K RED cinema camera and no crew, no lighting, no cranes? That the iPhone “needs help” that traditional cinema cameras do not? I mean, guess what, they used professional microphones too.</p><p> Apple occasionally points out that they make all their software — iOS, MacOS, Safari and Webkit, Final Cut, the iWork suite, Photos and Camera … all of it — using Xcode, Swift, Objective-C, and the AppKit, UIKit, and SwiftUI frameworks that they offer free of charge to all developers. Pissing all over Apple for using expensive production sets for their keynote shoots while promoting the fact that they shot it using iPhone cameras is like pissing on Apple&#39;s developer offerings because a lone developer or small team couldn&#39;t create an entire operating system or non-linear professional video editing system.</p><p> The whole point is that an iPhone 15 Pro camera is so good that it can fit right in on a high-budget commercial film shoot, and produce world-class results. There&#39;s no implication that a casual user can get results like this by just hitting the shutter button in the iPhone Camera app. That&#39;s why Apple made an entire <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast">behind-the-scenes documentary</a> ! To show us what it takes to make something look this good.</p><p> Why be so cynical? What Apple has accomplished here is extraordinary. They shot a 30-minute film using the same phone cameras they sell to hundreds of millions of people around the world, and the footage looked so good that <em>no one could tell it was shot using iPhones until they told us so</em> .</p><p> This is Apple at its best: they make tools for us, using those very same tools themselves.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Downplaying the Fact That Apple Shot ‘Scary Fast’ With iPhones’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/downplaying-shot-on-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;What the Actual&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/31/ep-388" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v46" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/the-talk-show-388" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40326</id><published> 2023-11-01T00:58:49Z</published><updated> 2023-11-01T00:58:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Peter Coy, in a subscriber-only column for The New York Times (I&#39;m using a gift sharing link, which I hope works for all of you):</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. sells a lot of smart watches during the holidays, but this year its sales of most Apple Watch models may well drop 100 percent — to literally zero — the day after Christmas.</p><p> That&#39;s because of a <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files?file=secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1276_notice10262023sgl.pdf">ruling</a> Thursday by the International Trade Commission that most Apple Watches contain parts that infringe on patents held by Masimo Corp., a producer of medical technology, and its sister company, Cercacor Laboratories Inc., both of Irvine, Calif. An import ban and a cease-and-desist order on sales both take effect on Dec. 26 — unless President Biden reverses the decision by Dec. 25, which appears unlikely. (Presidents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">rarely</a> overrule the <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/">independent, nonpartisan agency</a> , which was <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub0000.pdf">founded</a> in 1916 as the US Tariff Commission.) [...]</p><p> Apple declined to provide an executive to speak on the record. The company&#39;s position is that Masimo is pursuing a strategy of litigation over innovation, hoping to generate a fresh stream of royalties because royalties from past litigation have dried up. Apple points out that the federal jury that deadlocked in May was 6-to-1 for Apple, indicating that Masimo was a long way from making its case.</p><p> This fight is far from over. “My goal isn&#39;t just to beat Apple,” Kiani told me in an interview last summer. “It&#39;s to get Apple to change its ways.”</p></blockquote><p> One way or another, I expect Apple Watch to remain available for sale in the US But that deadline is just two months away.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Patent Fight That Could Take Apple Watches Off the Market’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/apple-watch-masimo-patent-suit">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Behind the Scenes at &#39;Scary Fast&#39; — Shot With iPhone 15 Pro Max </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v42" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40322</id><published> 2023-10-31T18:12:56Z</published><updated> 2023-10-31T20:54:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> On Monday, October 30, at Apple&#39;s Scary Fast special event unveiling the all-new MacBook Pro with the M3 family of chips and 24-inch iMac with M3, there was an unseen star of the show working behind the scenes. All of the presenters, locations, and drone footage in the event were filmed using iPhone 15 Pro Max, the preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers. Led by documentary film director Brian Oakes, known for the award-winning <em>Jim: The James Foley Story</em> and <em>Living with Lincoln</em> , Scary Fast put iPhone 15 Pro Max right in the middle of the action.</p></blockquote><p> I noticed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/shot-on-iphone.jpeg">the credit at the end of the video</a> last night: “This event was shot on iPhone and edited on Mac”, but until I saw that, I never would have guessed that the video was shot on iPhones. It looked every bit as good as Apple&#39;s previous pre-recorded keynotes, which presumably were shot on dedicated professional digital film cameras. To my eyes Apple didn&#39;t sacrifice an iota of image quality.</p><p> Even better, the behind-the-scenes documentary is fascinating. Given their cinematic quality, I&#39;ve always assumed these videos were major productions behind the scenes, but now we can <em>see</em> it — everything from lighting, directing, cinematography, sound, set design, talent, crew, editing, color grading — every single aspect of these keynotes aspires to the highest levels of production quality. Not merely “ <em>this looks and sounds good for a marketing video</em> ”, but “ <em>this looks and sounds good for a movie</em> ”.</p><p> It&#39;s impressive what the iPhone 15 Pro camera is capable of.

<p>Stephen Robles tested 11 leather cases for the iPhone 15 Pro, and <a href="https://youtu.be/6WNnw9Swhyc?si=ydQemaV8V6iubGZN">put together a nice video review</a> . If you&#39;re in the market for a leather iPhone case for your new iPhone 15, you should definitely watch his video.</p><p> For the last three or four years now, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll">I&#39;ve been buying</a> leather iPhone cases from <a href="https://bullstrap.co/products/magsafe-iphone-cases-sienna?variant=43515355300034">Bullstrap</a> . They&#39;re expensive — $89 — but they check every box for me:</p><ul><li> High-quality leather. Feels good, smells good, ages well.</li><li> A cut-out bottom lip. This design used to be common, but is getting harder and harder to find on <em>any</em> iPhone cases. I presume that&#39;s because people prefer cases with a lip that goes around the entire circumference of the front face of the phone, “for protection”, but the additional protection of covering the bottom lip seems negligible to me. I strongly prefer the way a no-bottom-lip case feels when swiping up from the bottom of the phone — an action I perform dozens of times a day. This design also solves <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+case+usb-c+cable+doesn't+fit">any problems</a> regarding USB-C or Thunderbolt cables fitting while your iPhone is encased.</li><li> Good buttons. Not great buttons, but good. This includes a button, not a cutout, for the Action button.</li><li> A unique (well, sort of — see below) “gentle hump” design around the camera cutout. I think this looks good, and it <em>feels</em> great. I don&#39;t like a sharp plastic ring around the camera cutout.</li></ul><p> Robles ranked the Bullstrap highly, but behind <a href="https://ryanlondon.com/collections/leather-iphone-cases/products/leather-iphone-15-pro-max-shell-case-magsafe-saddle-brown?variant=46641687822656">the case from Ryan London</a> . I don&#39;t know what the deal is between these two companies, but their cases are nearly identical. Same shape (no bottom lip), same buttons, same gentle hump around the camera cutout. I suspect both companies use the same manufacturer in China. Robles prefers the Ryan London because he prefers the way their leather both looks and feels. It definitely looks like a slightly different texture. Also, the Ryan London cases are a bit cheaper: $59 (with an optional $8 add-on to personalize your case with some embossed text).</p><p> <strong>Previously:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll">My reader poll from April</a> regarding case usage amongst DF readers. I posted <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/bullstrap-case-before-after.jpeg">this photo comparing a year-old Bullstrap case next to my then-brand-new one</a> for last year&#39;s iPhone 14.</p><p> <strong>Postscript</strong> : I actually like Apple&#39;s FineWoven cases. I spent a week vacationing in Florida with my iPhone 15 Pro in one. (I go caseless most of the time, but like using a case while traveling, when I&#39;m more likely to be taking a lot of pictures with my phone. An encased iPhone feels more like a camera to me, with better grippiness.) The dealbreaker for me is not the FineWoven material, which I actually kind of like. Rather, it&#39;s the bottom lip. If Apple&#39;s FineWoven cases had a cutout along the bottom, that would probably be the only case I&#39;d use.</p><p> <strong>Holy Crap Another Postscript:</strong> I, uh, just happened to run into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dan-seifert">Dan Seifert</a> from The Verge this morning, and wouldn&#39;t you know it, he had a brand-new Ryan London leather case on his iPhone 15 Pro. I had my Bullstrap with me, we compared, and we both agreed that the Ryan London leather looks just as good but has a slightly different — and better — feel. You can&#39;t go wrong with either of them — they really are remarkably similar cases overall, almost certainly made by the same Chinese manufacturer — but given that it&#39;s $30 cheaper, I suppose I&#39;d recommend the Ryan London. I actually like the Bullstrap embossed logo, though.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The Best Leather Cases for iPhone 15 Pro</title></entry><entry><title> &#39;Matthew Perry Was the Sarcastic Soul of “Friends”&#39; </title><link href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/matthew-perry-death-friends-chandler-bing-sarcasm-sitcom-1234865183/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v40" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40320</id><published> 2023-10-29T20:28:47Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T21:44:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alan Sepinwall, writing for Rolling Stone:</p><blockquote><p> There&#39;s not a lot of Matthew Perry in the pilot episode of <em>Friends</em> , but he gets to deliver one of its funniest jokes. As the gang sits around Central Perk, a newly-divorced Ross admits that he just wants to be married again. A second later, Rachel wanders into the coffee shop, soaking wet and wearing a wedding dress. Without missing a beat, Perry&#39;s Chandler Bing declares, “And I just want a million dollars!”</p><p> Like a lot of Chandler punchlines, it&#39;s quick and biting in its sarcasm. And like a lot of Chandler punchlines, Perry&#39;s delivery elevates it from a smartass quip that a few dozen actors could say into something you can&#39;t imagine leaving anyone else&#39;s mouth.</p><p> Note the timing and the emphasis of the thing. The pause after “And I,” the way he hits the “I” as hard as he does, and the way his voice goes full game show host as he says “million dollars,” all combine to give the gag a musicality beyond what <em>Friends</em> creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane wrote on the page. It&#39;s a small moment in an episode that is primarily concerned with characters who are not Chandler Bing. But you watch it and you want to hear him say things like it, again and again and again.</p></blockquote><p> Perry was so great on <em>Friends</em> , but my favorite show he was on was the short-lived <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/studio-60-on-the-sunset-strip/umc.cmc.2shyb7anow8v1rlv12c6lsx7v">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em> , a 2006 Aaron Sorkin show that I&#39;ve always thought failed in part <sup>*</sup> because it was a few years ahead of its time. Its lone 22-episode season aired on NBC. It was too smart, too cinematic, for network TV. It should have been on a cable channel like HBO, or, if it aired a decade later, a streaming service. The show was so good (at times — 22 episodes was way too many for a show striving for such quality), and Perry was sublime.</p><p> Perry, too, deserves accolades for his remarkable openness regarding his long struggle with addiction, and his heartfelt willingness to help anyone and everyone else with The Problem. Rest in peace.</p><p> <small>* I don&#39;t know if it hurt <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em> , but another weird thing about it was that it debuted the same year, on the same network, as Tina Fey&#39;s hall-of-fame-funny sitcom <em><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/30-rock/6240863759978157112">30 Rock</a></em> . Both shows shared the same fundamental premise: they were about fictionalized versions of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> . They even both had numbers in their titles, and those numbers were oddly similar. <em>Studio 60</em> was a funny drama, and <em>30 Rock</em> a sitcom&#39;s sitcom, but I always wondered if it was a bad idea to launch two <em>roman a clefs</em> about <em>SNL</em> at the same time.</small></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Matthew Perry Was the Sarcastic Soul of “Friends”’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-chandler-bing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3z" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40319</id><published> 2023-10-29T20:17:26Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T20:17:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alexis Soloski, writing for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> A confession: When I received a news alert that the actor Matthew Perry had died, my mind adopted the particular cadence that Perry perfected as Chandler Bing, the character he played for 10 seasons on the NBC sitcom <em>Friends</em> . Here is what I thought, “Could this <em>be</em> any sadder?”</p><p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html">Perry, 54, died</a> nearly a year after the publication of <em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething">Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a></em> , an unusually candid memoir of addiction and recovery. As he detailed in that book, he spent many of the best years of his career oblivious, avoidant, numb — conditions that don&#39;t typically encourage great acting. But he was great. And it had seemed reasonable, if rose-colored, to hope that sobriety might make him better, returning him to the nervy, instinctive brilliance of his peak years. That hope is now foreclosed. [...]</p><p> To say that he never did anything quite as good as <em>Friends</em> , before or after, is not to diminish his achievement. Even among the irrepressible talents of his co-stars, Perry stood out, for a rubbery, heedless way with physical comedy and a split-second timing that most stopwatches would envy. If you have seen more than a few episodes of the show — and many, many millions have, including fans born years after its initial airing — you will have absorbed Chandler&#39;s rhythms, his catchphrases, the way Perry&#39;s handsome, moony face would stretch like spandex, the better to sell a reaction. He had both an absolute commitment to what a line required and a way of gently ironizing that line. His character was the butt of jokes. Perry was in on those same jokes. There was a boyishness to him that seemed to excuse his characters&#39; worst behavior, on <em>Friends</em> and in subsequent roles.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Are There Ever Too Many Love Songs?&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/27/ep-387" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/the-talk-show-387" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40317</id><published> 2023-10-28T01:51:01Z</published><updated> 2023-10-28T01:51:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors on the new “use an emoji as a sticker reaction in Messages” feature in iOS 17.2, which just came out today as a public beta:</p><blockquote><p> Instead, to send a sticker response you have to tap and hold on a message and then choose Add Sticker from the resulting contextual menu, then choose a sticker or emoji. It&#39;s an extra step that really shouldn&#39;t be necessary and makes stickers feel like an afterthought, which they apparently are.</p><p> It gets worse. When you add a sticker reaction, it&#39;s placed on top of the message you&#39;re reacting to, obscuring part of the text! Why in the world would Apple choose a placement that makes it impossible to read the text being responded to? The right placement for these reactions is … wait for it … the same place that Tapbacks appear, in a little bubble snuggled up against the message that&#39;s being reacted to.</p></blockquote><p> This design feels more than a bit spiteful to me. I suspect there are two contingents inside Apple: the “ <em>Tapbacks are perfect just as they are</em> ” side (who prefer there are only six of them — heart, thumbs-up, thumbs-down, ha-ha, “!!”, and “?” — and who insist that they&#39;re monochrome), and the “ <em>Jesus H. Christ, every single other popular messaging platform in the world lets users react with any emoji they want, in full color</em> ” side. This new emoji-as-stickers feature is a small win for the latter contingent, but the Tapbacks-are-perfect side is calling the shots, and keeping Tapbacks as the only reactions that (a) are super-easy to apply, and (b) don&#39;t obscure the text of the message.</p><p> I&#39;ve been playing with the feature, and the one emoji I&#39;ve found that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/emoji-stickers-finger.jpeg">only <em>barely</em> obscures the text of the message</a> it&#39;s applied to just happens to be the perfect emoji to express my feelings about how this feature currently works: 🖕.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iOS 17.2 (Beta) Sticker Reactions Stink’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/ios-17-sticker-reactions-stink">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Google Spends $26 Billion Annually to Be the Default Search Engine Almost Everywhere (and Most of It Goes to You Know Who) </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934961/google-antitrust-trial-defaults-search-deal-26-3-billion" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40314</id><published> 2023-10-27T20:31:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T20:53:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>David Pierce, writing for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates"><em>US v. Google</em> antitrust trial</a> is about many things, but more than anything, it&#39;s about the power of defaults. Even if it&#39;s easy to switch browsers or platforms or search engines, the one that appears when you turn it on matters a lot. Google obviously agrees and has paid a staggering amount to make sure it is the default: testimony in the trial revealed that Google spent a total of $26.3 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones, and platforms. [...]</p><p> Just to put that $26.3 billion in context: Alphabet, Google&#39;s parent company, announced in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23929496/google-alphabet-q3-2023-earnings-ads-ai-sge">its recent earnings report</a> that Google Search ad business brought in about $44 billion over the last three months and about $165 billion in the last year. Its entire ad business — which also includes YouTube ads — made a bit under $90 billion in profit. This is all back-of-the-napkin math, but essentially, Google is giving up about 16 percent of its search revenue and about 29 percent of its profit to those distribution deals.</p><p> Most of that money, of course, goes to Apple. The New York Times recently reported that Google&#39;s deal to be the default search engine in Safari across Google products cost the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion">about $18 billion</a> in 2021.</p></blockquote><p> Goldman Sachs analysts have been estimating this number for years, and $18 billion in 2021 is pretty much in line with their estimates. (Goldman <em>conservatively</em> estimates about $17 billion in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traffic-acquisition-cost-tac.asp">TAC</a> payments from Google to Apple for this year, 2023. That would be the low end — Apple gets <em>at least</em> that much from Google for their partnership on this.)</p><p> Apple reports this revenue under Services, which has <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/">just grown past $20 billion per quarter</a> for Apple. So somewhere between 20-25 percent of Apple&#39;s Services revenue comes from these payments from Google alone. You can see why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google">Apple is rooting for Google</a> in this lawsuit.</p><p> This whole partnership with Google is the weakest link in Apple&#39;s overall privacy stance. Google generates so much money from search through user tracking that Apple would consider contrary to its own internal values. If Apple were to run its own search engine, it would be <em>far</em> more private than Google Search. But instead they partner with Google, set Google as the default for Safari on all platforms, and share in Google&#39;s profit to the tune of around $20 billion/year.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Spends $26 Billion Annually to Be the Default Search Engine Almost Everywhere (and Most of It Goes to You Know Who)’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> More like RipoffOS, Am I Right? </title><link href="https://www.gizchina.com/2023/10/19/hyperos-xiaomi-poco-redmi/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/xiaomi-hyperos" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40313</id><published> 2023-10-27T19:44:03Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T19:44:04Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Axios:</p><blockquote><p> New House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told Fox News&#39; Sean Hannity in his first interview as speaker that now is not the time to discuss legislation to address the scourge of mass shootings, adding: “The problem is the human heart, not guns.”</p></blockquote><p> Since no other civilized country on the planet has massacres like this, Johnson is implicitly arguing that the problem isn&#39;t the <em>human</em> heart, but the <em>American</em> heart.</p><p> Or, maybe the problem is the fact that America is the <em>only</em> country where military-grade assault rifles are not just legal, but legally obtainable by mentally ill angry men like this lunatic in Maine.</p><p> Either we are the worst people on the planet, or we have the worst gun laws.</p><blockquote><p> Why it matters: President Biden and Democrats in Congress are urging action in the wake of the shooting in Lewiston, Maine that left 18 people dead. Johnson argued that it was inappropriate to discuss gun control “in the middle of the crisis,” and that he believes, “it&#39;s not the weapon, it&#39;s the underlying problem.”</p></blockquote><p> This “ <em>now is not the time</em> ” argument gets trotted out by Republicans after each and every gun massacre. Right after their tweets offering “thoughts and prayers”. Bullshit. The aftermath of a massacre is <em>the</em> time to demand sane gun control measures. That&#39;s when the issue is clarified. Would Republicans argue that October 8 was “not the right time” for Israel to discuss Hamas terrorism? Was September 12, 2001 “not the right time” to discuss Al-Qaeda? Should FDR have delivered an address to the nation on December 8, 1941, advising that we relax, let cooler heads prevail, because the aftermath of Japan&#39;s attack on Pearl Harbor “was not the time” to consider retaliating?</p><p> Imagine a Venezuelan refugee illegally crosses the US-Mexico border next week and kills 18 US citizens with a bomb he carried across. Would Hannity have a guest on Fox News — say, Mike Johnson — arguing that “now is not the time, in the middle of the crisis, to talk about border security”?</p><p> Our emotional responses to these massacres are valid. Strike while the iron, and our blood, is running hot. Let our emotions fuel the urgency of our attempts to respond with <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/instant-intel/house-gun-legislation-background-checks-polling">overwhelmingly popular gun control legislation</a> , and let Republicans head into elections in two weeks opposing them.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Aftermath of a Massacre Is Always the Time to Push for Gun Legislation’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/aftermath">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CT Scans Reveal the Complexity of Apple&#39;s $129 Thunderbolt Cable </title><link href="https://twitter.com/jonbruner/status/1714696044356005949" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/apple-thunderbolt-cable" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40309</id><published> 2023-10-26T01:00:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T01:57:06Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">Joe Rossignol, MacRumors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced that it is increasing the prices of some of its subscription-based services, including Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+, for new and existing subscribers in the US and <a href="https://www.macg.co/services/2023/10/augmentation-imminente-des-abonnements-apple-arcade-apple-tv-et-apple-one-140063">many other countries around the world</a> .</p><p> The price changes in the US are as follows:</p><ul><li> Apple TV+: $6.99 per month → $9.99 per month</li><li> Apple Arcade: $4.99 per month → $6.99 per month</li><li> Apple News+: $9.99 per month → $12.99 per month</li></ul><p> For those who subscribe to Apple TV+ on an annual basis, the price has increased from $69 per year to $99 per year accordingly.</p><p> Prices for the Apple One bundles that include these services are also increasing as a result:</p><ul><li> Individual: $16.95 per month → $19.95 per month</li><li> Family: $22.95 per month → $25.95 per month</li><li> Premier: $32.95 per month → $37.95 per month</li></ul><p> [...] There are no price increases for Apple Music and Apple Fitness+ today.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d have linked to the Apple Newsroom announcement of these price increases, but there&#39;s not a word about them there. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple Newsroom</a> is sort of a “good news only” company blog.</p><p> At the Apple One bundle level, these increases are pretty modest, but at the standalone level, these hikes are notable. TV+ is now double the price <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">it debuted at just four years ago</a> .</p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1717188520123445666">Tom Warren, on Twitter/X</a> , makes a keen observation regarding the ever-escalating prices of streaming services:</p><blockquote><p> If Apple TV, Netflix, and Disney+ keep raising prices then it will only force more people into piracy. It&#39;s already surprising how many in the UK use modified Fire TV sticks to access pirated TV shows and movies.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ll quibble with his verb choice and suggest “push” not “force” — no one is <em>forced</em> to bootleg content — but the point stands. Ever since the iTunes Music Store opened 20 years ago, at the height of MP3 file sharing via Napster and similar platforms, I&#39;ve always thought of media bootlegging as a form of negotiation. It&#39;s like ad hoc collective bargaining between users and the corporations that set the prices and define the experience of consuming the media.</p><p> Subscription pricing requires a form of calculus to find the sweet spot that generates the most money. Set the price too low and you&#39;ll reduce piracy but leave money on the table. Set the price too high and you&#39;ll generate less money because more users — ones who might otherwise have subscribed at a lower price — will choose to bootleg. (Some people, of course, will always choose to bootleg. There&#39;s no point trying to find a price to appease them.)</p><p> But pricing isn&#39;t the only factor in this equation. The experience is too. Bootlegging&#39;s obvious appeal is the price: zero. But it&#39;s always been a bit of a pain in the ass. Weird apps and sketchy sources. Steve Jobs emphasized this aspect of the iTunes Music Store when he introduced it: 99 cents was an appealing price, but not as appealing as free. But the overall experience of searching for and downloading music from iTunes was so much better than bootlegging that it made you happy to pay for the songs.</p><p> Apple still gets that part: their apps for consuming their services are generally very low on annoyances. You almost never have to sign back in because your previous sign-in expired. So many of the streaming video services I use on my Apple TV make me jump through hoops with those incredibly annoying sign-back-in flows where you have to open a URL on the web using another device (probably your phone, if you&#39;re on your couch), and enter a code that&#39;s on the TV screen. Then you have to wait like 20 seconds and they let you back in. Then a few months from now you have to do it again for unexplained reasons.</p><p> Every time the official service makes you watch an unskippable ad, every time their shitty custom video player makes fast-forwarding or rewinding janky, every time their shitty app feels slow or forgets where you were in a movie that you paused days ago — those little annoyances add up, and they reduce the user experience advantage that paying for content should provide compared to bootlegging it.</p><p> If the “pirate or pay?” debate for users were just about price, zillions more people would bootleg their music and content and games. It&#39;s more like this:</p><ul><li><p> <strong>Pirate:</strong> Pay nothing (good), feel guilty about stealing the content (bad), go through all the hassle of obtaining pirated content and cracked copies of games and apps, and managing your own local library of content that&#39;s fallen off the back of these proverbial trucks (bad). Also, there&#39;s a risk of legal trouble, getting your internet service disabled, or just plain embarrassment if some piracy watchdog catches you (bad).</p></li><li><p> <strong>Pay:</strong> Cough up the monthly subscription fee for the service (bad), feel no guilt because you&#39;re not stealing anything (good), avoid the hassles of obtaining and managing bootlegged media content (good), and enjoy the ease of use of the official app for the service.</p></li></ul><p> I didn&#39;t put a “(good)” or “(bad)” after that last one, because it varies so wildly from one service to another. The only content I&#39;ve bootlegged in years are those rare films that aren&#39;t available through legitimate channels, like the wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition">“de-specialized” editions of the original Star Wars trilogy</a> . In addition to the fact that I have more money than sense, I&#39;m incredibly lazy when it comes to consuming entertainment. I don&#39;t want to work, at all, to find it, download it, or manage it. But some streaming apps are so bad they make it feel like as much work to watch their content legitimately as it would be to pirate it.</p><p> That&#39;s one thing that is vastly under-remarked-upon regarding Netflix: they&#39;ve always provided a terrific user experience. Their apps are fast, reliable, and well-designed. Netflix never forgets or expires my sign-in credentials. You can tell that everyone at Netflix, right up to Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings, <em>cares</em> about the entire user experience. Netflix, culturally, is much like Apple in that regard: they have good taste baked into the company DNA.</p><p> As for Apple&#39;s price hikes today, I&#39;m an Apple One Premier subscriber, and I&#39;m fine — not happy, of course, but fine — with paying an extra $5/month for everything I get. Of the three component services whose standalone prices went up, TV+ and Arcade seem justified. News+, however, does not.</p><p> I&#39;ve been saying for a few years that Apple TV+ is becoming the new HBO — a channel dedicated to prestigious original content, quality over quantity — and that feels more true than ever now that HBO is being <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/warner_max">watered down inside Max</a> . Apple TV+ is home to a steady stream of original shows that my family really enjoys. I&#39;m pretty sure we have more favorite shows on TV+ than any other service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">Unlike Netflix</a> , Apple sticks with all its good shows and renews them for multiple seasons, allowing them to end satisfyingly. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-25">1</a></sup> TV+&#39;s average content quality is way higher than that of Disney+, which has been cranking out <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CyHm6Ots64Q">embarrassing franchise-tanking turds</a> like <em>Ahsoka</em> and <em>Secret Invasion</em> , relative disappointments like <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> (a bloviating six-part series which should have been cut down to one solid two-hour movie), and only occasional gems like <em>Andor</em> . And while Apple TV+ has long stood out for its relative dearth of old library content, in terms of original new content, it has way more good stuff — for my taste at least — than Amazon Prime, Hulu, Max, or the also-rans like Peacock and Paramount+. I just don&#39;t care as much about streaming access to old library content compared to new original stuff, and I don&#39;t think most other people do either.</p><p> As for Apple Arcade — I personally don&#39;t play many video games, but more and more, the ones I <em>do</em> play on my iPhone are from Arcade. No ads, no in-app-purchase pay-to-win chicanery, and an ever-growing library of really good games that span a wide range of genres. $7/month feels more than fair.</p><p> But News+? The primary and obvious appeal of Apple News+ is getting access to paywalled content from <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/publications/">participating publications</a> like The Wall Street Journal. That&#39;s a long list of newspapers and magazines. But the actual reading experience often stinks — most articles from most publishers in Apple News are lousy with huge ugly ads, breaking up each article every few paragraphs. And the ads are often almost comically low-class <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/">chumbox</a> scams. I posted <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">screenshots of a few of them</a> just a few weeks ago on Mastodon. Just look at them. <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-25">2</a></sup> These ads — and the quantity of them — do not look or feel like something you should experience in a premium $10/month subscription — let alone the new price of $13/month. The only way this price increase for News+ can be justified is if Apple is planning to use the increased subscription fee revenue to both reduce the number of ads in articles <em>and</em> increase their quality.</p><p> As with bootlegging media and pirating games and apps, ad blocking is a negotiation between users and publishers. Reading the same article in a web browser, with extensions installed that block user-hostile ads, is, for me at least, almost always a far better experience than reading in Apple News. Given that News+ is a not-cheap paid subscription, that user-experience equation should be the other way around: it should be nicer to read in Apple News than on the web. But it&#39;s not. And yet Apple is raising the price.</p><p> Finally, I&#39;ll note with mild annoyance but absolutely zero surprise that while Apple is now steadily <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/apple-price-increase-apple-tv-plus-music-1235412633/#">raising prices for its media content services every year or so</a> , the data storage tiers for iCloud — whether free or paid — have remained <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9341083/apple-icloud-storage-plans-cheaper">unchanged since 2015</a> except at the highest tier. Eight years! Steady increases in media subscription pricing are annoying but understandable. Never increasing the amount of storage most users get with iCloud feels stubborn and spiteful.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-25"><p> I said <em>good</em> shows, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/business/media/jon-stewart-the-problem-ends.html">not all shows</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-25"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-10-25"><p> If you scroll through the replies to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">my post on Mastodon</a> , you&#39;ll see a few people suggesting that the reason I&#39;m getting served bottom-of-the-barrel chumbox ads like this is that I must have “Personalized Ads” turned off in Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Apple Advertising.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> The new double tap gesture for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available today with watchOS 10.1, bringing a fast and convenient new way to interact with Apple Watch.</p><p> With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display.

It&#39;s a good feature, but it&#39;s not nearly as useful — yet? — as I was hoping. The one thing you have to get used to is that the watch only listens for the double tap gesture when the display is fully-on. You need to tilt your wrist to look at your watch before double tapping. Usually, that&#39;s natural — the reason you want to double tap to <em>do something</em> is because you see the thing you want do or dismiss. But I&#39;ve found times where an alert or something pops up that I want to invoke double tap on, but my wrist is oblique, and double tap doesn&#39;t register until I remember to tilt my wrist to a “looking straight at it” angle.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Double Tap Gesture Now Available With WatchOS 10.1 for Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/double-tap-watchos-10">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_scary_fast_event" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3m" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40306</id><published> 2023-10-24T19:12:03Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T01:38:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> So I&#39;m just guessing here, but I&#39;m thinking this event might be about iMacs only, and just an upgrade to the M2, and maybe some design changes, like, say, fresh colors.

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/spooktacular-apple-event-on-halloween-eve/">Dan Moren, Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Chalk this one up as something I&#39;ve never seen before: an Apple event in the <em>evening</em> . The company on Tuesday announced a “Scary Fast” event coming Monday, October 30 at 5pm Pacific time.</p><p> It&#39;s largely expected that this event will feature new Macs, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">reported by Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman this weekend</a> : the money seems to be on a refreshed 24-inch iMac, though other announcements are possible.</p></blockquote><p> Broadcasting an event at 8pm ET / 5pm PT is new, but we&#39;re still relatively early in the era of pre-recorded keynotes. Unusual to say the least — makes me wonder if there&#39;s some other shoe to drop that will make the timing make sense.</p><p> If it&#39;s the iMac, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the upgrade is to the M2, not the M3. Gurman reported that the iMac would skip the M2 and go straight to the M3, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-26/apple-aapl-plans-iphone-14-apple-watch-series-8-m2-macs-for-2022-and-2023-l4vd5unx">that report was all the way back in June <em>2022</em></a> :</p><blockquote><p> Outside of the Mac and iPad Pro, there&#39;s another place I expect the M2 to appear: Apple&#39;s mixed-reality headset. I&#39;m told the latest internal incarnations of the device run the base M2 chip along with 16 gigabytes of RAM. [...]</p><p> Apple is also already at work on the M2&#39;s successor, the M3, and the company is planning to use that chip as early as next year with updates to the 13-inch MacBook Air code-named J513, a 15-inch MacBook Air known as J515, a new iMac code-named J433 and possibly a 12-inch laptop that&#39;s still in early development.</p></blockquote><p> He was correct about the Vision Pro using the M2 — and remember, that was a full year ahead of it being announced — but it doesn&#39;t feel right to me that the M3 chip would debut in the iMac. Gurman has also pointed out that MacBook Pros — both the not-really-all-that-“pro” 13-inch model, and the truly-pro 14- and 16-inch models — are in short supply at the moment, with mid-November shipping dates for most configurations. But it just feels too early for the M3 Pro/Max chips to start shipping, when the A17 Pro — the chip the M3 is presumably based on — only started shipping last month. Given what I&#39;ve heard about TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability — particularly obtaining wafers — I think their hands are full just producing A17 Pro chips for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p><p> So I&#39;m just guessing here, but I&#39;m thinking this event might be about iMacs only, with an upgrade to the M2, and maybe some design changes — like, say, fresh colors. It&#39;d be a lot more fun if it&#39;s the debut of the M3, but my spidey sense says that&#39;s not happening yet.</p><p> <em>Also</em> : It would sort of feel awkward to start launching $1,300 M3-based iMacs (or $1,000 iPad Pros) months ahead of the $3,500 Vision Pro, which will have the M2. It feels natural to me that M3-based Macs and iPads will only launch <em>after</em> the Vision Pro, so that when the Vision Pro is announced, the M2 is still the “current” Apple silicon generation.</p><p> <em>But</em> : The event is named “Scary Fast”, so maybe it <em>is</em> about the debut of the M3 series? I still don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have the M3 Pro/Max chips ready, but maybe it&#39;s a refresh across the line for all the Macs that use the regular M2 (and in the iMac&#39;s case, M1)?</p><p> So it looks like Gurman is going to beat Ming-Chi Kuo in the “are new Macs coming this year?” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Thunderdome face-off</a> , but it&#39;s fun that no one seems to know what exactly is coming.</p><h2> Postscript</h2><p> OK here&#39;s a spitball idea that fits all the puzzle pieces together:</p><ul><li> Regular 24-inch iMacs get upgraded to the M2.</li><li> These new iMacs might also be the source for those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">purported color-matched braided USB-C cables</a> that were assumed to be for the iPhones 15. All iPhone 15 models ship with plain white braided cables, but the existing M1 iMacs shipped with fun color-matched Lightning cables.</li><li> New “pro” iMacs are launched, with the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, like the ones in the current 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros (which only debuted early this year). Maybe these hypothetical iMac Pros will have bigger displays too? 27 inches would match both the Studio Display and the old Intel-based “big” iMacs.</li></ul><p> M2 Pro and Max iMacs would justify “Scary Fast” in a way that just plain M2 iMac speed bumps would not. This would still allow the Vision Pro to launch “early next year” while the M2 remains the current Apple silicon generation. And this would fit with the scuttlebutt that TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability is, for the near future, almost entirely dedicated to keeping up with demand for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple to Broadcast &#39;Scary Fast&#39; Event Next Monday Night </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_and_ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3j" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40303</id><published> 2023-10-23T23:33:57Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T01:37:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Speaking of</a> Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">he has an interesting bit about Apple&#39;s AI efforts in his latest Power On column</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The company has some catching up to do. Apple largely sat on the sidelines when OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT took off like a rocket last year. It watched as Google and Microsoft Corp. rolled out generative AI versions of their search engines, which spit out convincingly human-like responses to users&#39; queries. Microsoft also updated its Windows apps with smarter assistants, and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled an AI-enhanced overhaul of Alexa.</p><p> All the while, the only noteworthy AI release from Apple was an improved auto-correct system in iOS 17.</p></blockquote><p> I would argue that the improved autocorrect in iOS 17 is a major feature — in my use it&#39;s clearly an improvement, and autocorrect is a feature used every day, in almost every app, by almost every iOS user. It&#39;s one of the most used and most important features in the entire OS. I&#39;d also argue that Apple has done some terrific work with AI features in Photos. The search feature in Photos works <em>really</em> well.</p><p> But I think Gurman&#39;s summary does get at an essential truth. If I asked you “Which companies are at the forefront of AI-powered products?”, I doubt you&#39;d put Apple on the list. And AI is proving so useful — and yet is a nascent field — that Apple needs to soon be on that list, lest their products begin to fall behind competitively. “Which companies are best at integrating AI into products?” is going to be like “Which companies are best at creating hardware at scale?” and “Which companies are best at human interface design?”</p><p> Gurman continues:</p><blockquote><p> Now, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook says that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years. But I can tell you in no uncertain terms that Apple executives were caught off guard by the industry&#39;s sudden AI fever and have been scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time.</p><p> “There&#39;s a lot of anxiety about this and it&#39;s considered a pretty big miss internally,” a person with knowledge of the matter told Power On.</p><p> As I first reported in July, the company built its own large language model called Ajax and rolled out an internal chatbot dubbed “Apple GPT” to test out the functionality. The critical next step is determining if the technology is up to snuff with the competition and how Apple will actually apply it to its products.</p></blockquote><p> What I have heard from little birdies in Cupertino is <em>not</em> that there was a miss on this already. Apple is almost never at the forefront of stuff like this. They&#39;re a deliberate company. Their goal, as with any new technology, is to integrate it into products in meaningful ways <em>best</em> , not <em>first</em> . That&#39;s why there&#39;s no internal anxiety that they&#39;ve already missed anything related to AI.</p><p> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver, but that the company — if only for privacy reasons — will only use what comes from its own AI/ML team.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple and AI</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
