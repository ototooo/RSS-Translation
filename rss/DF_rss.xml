<p>Max Tani，Semafor 报道：</p><blockquote><p>周三，Instagram 母公司 Meta 推出了 Threads，这是 Instagram 的基于文本的伴侣，类似于 Twitter 和其他基于文本的社交平台。几个小时后，Twitter 的律师亚历克斯·斯皮罗 (Alex Spiro) <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ifn0l6bs/production/27109f01431939c8177d408d3c9848c3b46632cd.pdf">致信</a>Meta 首席执行官马克·扎克伯格 (Mark Zuckerberg)，指责该公司“系统性、故意且非法地盗用 Twitter 的商业秘密和其他知识产权”。</p></blockquote><p>祝你好运。</p><blockquote><p>斯皮罗指责 Meta 雇佣了数十名前 Twitter 员工，他们“曾经并继续有权访问 Twitter 的商业秘密和其他高度机密信息”。</p><p>他还声称，Meta 指派这些员工开发“Meta 的山寨‘Threads’应用程序，其具体目的是利用 Twitter 的商业秘密和其他知识产权来加速 Meta 竞争应用程序的开发，这违反了州和联邦法律以及这些员工对 Twitter 的持续义务。”</p></blockquote><p>认为 Meta 需要 Twitter 的工程师来构建 Threads 是很滑稽的。就像 Twitter 是可靠性和稳定性的典范一样，Meta 的平台并不能为更多的用户提供服务。更搞笑的是：</p><blockquote><p> Meta 的通讯总监安迪·斯通 (Andy Stone) 告诉 Semafor，Twitter 的指控毫无根据。 “Threads 工程团队中没有人是 Twitter 前员工——这不是一回事，”他说。</p></blockquote><p>即使 Twitter 前员工<em>正在</em>开发 Threads，埃隆·马斯克还是解雇了他们。雇用被竞争对手解雇的人员并不违法。如果是的话就有点古怪了。这封信是如此透明：马斯克受到了 Threads 的威胁，并嫉妒它所获得的媒体关注，因此他猛烈抨击。命令他的律师发出这样一封愚蠢的信，感觉就像特朗普的举动，毫不夸张。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Twitter 威胁要因话题起诉 Meta，Meta 高管威胁要笑尿裤子”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/twitter-threatens-suit-over-threads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Mastodon 关于 Threads 的常见问题解答</title><link href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwv" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/mastodon-threads-faq" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40063</id><published> 2023-07-06T23:47:02Z</published><updated> 2023-07-06T23:47:02Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mastodon 创始人兼首席执行官 Eugen Rochko：</p><blockquote><p>今天，Meta 推出了名为 Threads 的新微博平台。此次发布值得注意的是，Threads 打算通过使用与 Mastodon 相同的标准协议 ActivityPub 成为去中心化社交网络的一部分。关于 Threads 将会是什么以及它对 Mastodon 意味着什么，有很多猜测。我们根据今天发布的内容汇总了一些最常见的问题和我们的答复。</p></blockquote><p>这个常见问题解答让我印象深刻的是，几乎每个问题都没有现实依据。它平息了那些将 Facebook 视为企业妖怪的人们的非理性恐惧。最近<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open" title="大胆的火球：“不是那种开放”">写了</a><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/more_on_preemptively_blocking" title="大胆的火球：“更多关于先发制人地阻止 Facebook 即将进入的 ActivityPub 条目”">很多</a>关于 Threads 加入开放联邦宇宙的文章，我可以保证这些担忧是真实的，因为人们确实认为 Threads 会以某种方式窃取他们的数据，或者 Facebook 会以某种方式向 Mastodon 上的用户展示广告服务器，但这些恐惧在现实中没有更多的根据，就像担心住在你床底下的怪物一样。</p><p>这是真正重要的一点：</p><blockquote><p> <em>Meta 会拥抱、扩展、消灭 ActivityPub 协议吗？</em></p><p>可以将 Meta 采用 ActivityPub 作为其新社交媒体平台和 Meta 在十年前采用 XMPP 作为其 Messenger 服务进行比较。曾经有一段时间，Facebook 的用户和 Google Talk 的用户可以互相聊天，也可以与来自自托管 XMPP 服务器的人聊天，然后每个平台都被锁定在我们今天所知的孤岛中。什么可以阻止这种情况重演？好吧，即使 Threads 放弃了 ActivityPub，我们最终的结果也正是我们现在所处的位置。 XMPP 在书呆子圈子之外并不独立存在，而 ActivityPub 则享有 Mastodon 的支持和品牌认可。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接至“Mastodon 线程常见问题解答”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/mastodon-threads-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>自定义域名作为 Bluesky 句柄 — 有趣的功能，现在是一种商业模式</title><link href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwu" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/bluesky-domain-names" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40062</id><published> 2023-07-06T22:18:43Z</published><updated> 2023-07-07T16:01:44Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>来自 Bluesky 官方博客（专业提示：与<em>brewski</em>和<em>Russki</em>押韵）：</p><blockquote><p>我们相信，必须有更好的策略来维持不需要出售用户数据用于广告的社交网络。我们朝另一个方向迈出的第一步是付费服务，我们从<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">自定义域</a>开始。虽然设置与 Bluesky 和 ​​AT 协议一起使用的自定义域相当简单，但它确实需要熟悉域注册商和 DNS 设置。然而，超过 13,000 名用户已经将他们已经拥有的域名重新用作句柄，或者仅仅因为 Bluesky 就购买了域名。域名具有巨大的潜力，可以作为定制身份的个性化方式，也可以作为验证基于现有网络的声誉的去中心化方式。例如，美国参议员在没有我们参与的情况下使用<code>senate.gov</code>域在 Bluesky 上验证他们的身份，第三方开发人员构建了一个<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb">Web 扩展</a>来检查网站是否链接到 AT 协议身份。域作为句柄领域的可能性非常广泛。</p><p><em>我们与流行的域名注册商 Namecheap 合作，<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">提供轻松的域名购买和管理服务</a>。</em>这样，人们可以在几分钟内将自定义域设置为 Bluesky 和 ​​AT 协议的句柄。</p></blockquote><p>使其成为 Bluesky 公司（合法的公益公司）的内置功能和经常性收入来源是一个好主意。使用自定义域名作为您的句柄是 Bluesky 和 ​​AT 协议的最佳功能之一，而且确实相当简单。但通过将其作为一项功能构建，Bluesky 可以使其变得<em>超级</em>简单，并消除出错的可能性。</p><p>在Bluesky的设置中（比较简洁），进入“高级”下的“更改句柄”。然后点击（或单击）“我有自己的域名”。在下一个屏幕上，在顶部字段中输入您拥有并希望使用的域名，Bluesky <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bluesky-custom-domain.png" title="Bluesky iPhone 应用程序的屏幕截图，其中包含我的帐户 gruber.foo 的自定义域名信息。">将向您显示要在注册商处输入的域名和值</a>。我使用的是“gruber.foo”，但您也可以轻松使用“john.gruber.foo”等子域。 Bluesky 上的 Daring Fireball 帐户将是“daringfireball.net”——我可以使用“gruber.daringfireball.net”作为我的个人帐户。像《纽约时报》这样的出版物可以允许每位记者拥有官方 Bluesky 帐户，例如“ <em>reportername</em> .nytimes.com”。从某种意义上说，验证是内置的。</p><p>然后，只需转到您的域名注册商并使用您从 Bluesky 应用程序复制的域名和值创建一个“TXT”类型的条目。等待几分钟，让更改生效，您的自定义域现在就是您的 Bluesky 句柄。 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/google-domains-gruber-foo-settings.png" title="Google Domains 网站上的 DNS 面板的屏幕截图，显示了我使用 gruber.foo 作为 Bluesky 用户名的设置。">这是我在 Google Domains 中的设置的屏幕截图</a>。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“自定义域名作为 Bluesky 句柄”—“有趣的功能，现在是一种商业模式”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/bluesky-domain-names">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/threads" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwt" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40061</id><published> 2023-07-06T03:58:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-06T04:24:41Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">关于 Facebook 备受期待的 Twitter 竞争对手的一些初步想法和观察。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Facebook 备受期待的 Twitter 竞争对手<a href="https://www.threads.net/">Threads</a> （被称为“Instagram 应用程序”）已经退出市场。一些初步的想法和观察：</p><ul><li><p>该网站的主页仅包含 iPhone 和 Android 应用程序的链接，但您可以查看<a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber" title="我的帐户 @gruber 的线程个人资料页面。">用户的个人资料页面</a>和<a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVYKiNxmWy/" title="我在 Threads 上发表的第一篇文章的永久链接，其中我指出，就像它的老兄弟 Instagram 一样，iOS 应用程序仅适用于 iPhone，不适用于 iPad。">帖子（线程？）的</a>永久链接。</p></li><li><p> iOS 应用程序仅支持 iPhone 布局。我想我<em>不</em>应该对此感到惊讶，因为在推出 13 年后，Instagram 的 iOS 应用程序<em>仍然</em>不原生支持 iPad，但不知怎的，我<em>确实</em>觉得这令人惊讶。 Instagram 不会开发 iPad 应用，这真是多年来的一个谜。</p></li><li><p>他们在网络上使用“www”前缀，就像 Instagram 一样。这对我来说感觉很古老。</p></li><li><p>该网站仅供查看。您无法登录、发帖或回复。没有迹象表明这是暂时的还是有意为之。</p></li><li><p> URL 类似于 Instagram 的：域名 + “/t/” + 唯一的帖子 ID。 （Threads 使用“/t/”（代表<em>“thread”</em> ），Instagram 使用“/p/”（代表<em>“post”</em> ，我猜。）例如：https: <code>https://www.threads.net/t/CuRtcYTNY3J/</code> 。最好是包含发帖者用户名的 URL 格式，这样您只需查看 URL 就可以知道是谁发布的。显示归属的示例 URL：</p><p>推特： <code>https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1667603292162240512</code><br />蓝天： <code>https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jznmowkftf2e</code><br />乳齿象： <code>https://mastodon.social/@daringfireball/110652280163526529</code></p></li><li><p>使用我现有的 Instagram 凭据登录非常简单，这些凭据已经在我的手机上，因为我安装了 Instagram。我什至不需要重新输入密码。相同的用户名、相同的头像，而且我选择在 Threads 上关注与在 Instagram 上关注的完全相同的帐户。</p></li><li><p>时间线是经过算法计算的——它向您显示来自您关注的人和来自您不关注的人的帖子。 Threads 向公众发布后不久，我的时间线几乎完全来自我不关注的帐户，这些帐户似乎是在 Threads 处于测试阶段时一直在测试 Threads 的用户。然而，当我在几个小时后输入这句话时，我的时间线主要来自我关注的人，因此更有趣。但到目前为止，还没有办法过滤您的时间线以<em>仅</em>显示您选择关注的帐户中的话题。</p></li><li><p>您可以搜索帐户，但还没有内容搜索（还？）。</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVKuinPTcH/">也</a>没有主题标签（还？）。很好，<a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVWW5URH66/">我说</a>，但我敢打赌他们很快就会到来。</p></li><li><p>不过，Threads<em>推出</em>的一项功能是引用帖子（用 Twitter 的说法是转发）。蓝天也有。引用帖子有用、有趣，并且是许多人使用 Twitter 的方式的核心。而乳齿象却没有它们——不是因为遗漏，而是有意为之。 <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314523447694321" title="早在五月初，我就预测《Mastodon》的受欢迎程度将超过《Mastodon》。">正如我打趣的那样</a>，Bluesky 感觉像是为喜欢 Twitter 的人们提供的一项新服务。线程也有这种感觉。 Mastodon 感觉就像是为那些讨厌 Twitter 的人提供的服务，没有什么比它不发布报价更能说明这一点的了。</p></li><li><p>帖子限制为 500 个字符，我认为这是类似 Twitter 服务的上限。</p></li><li><p>目前还没有关于 API 的消息。我并不是建议 Threads 可能提供一个 API 来支持第三方客户端——Facebook 不可能这么做——但如果机器人想超越 Twitter，就应该为机器人等提供一个编程接口。 （<a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVafQTvquB">扎克伯格已经将其列为目标</a>。）</p></li><li><p>说到扎克，除了在 Threads 上 <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/replies" title="马克·扎克伯格的 Threads 帐户。">非常活跃</a>之外，他 11 年来首次在 Twitter 上发帖，<a href="https://twitter.com/finkd/status/1676747594460962817">这真是太完美了</a>。</p></li><li><p> Threads 推出后 4 小时内就有超过 500 万人注册。 （ <a href="https://mastodon-analytics.com/">Mastodon 大约有 120 万活跃用户</a>。）</p></li><li><p>还没有广告。如果Threads成功了，肯定会有广告。但与此同时，它提供的体验比 Twitter 好得多，Twitter 上的广告频繁、规模大<a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1669783032558137344">且具有欺骗性</a>。 （他们很快<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/yaccarino-sound-on-ads">可能会开始播放声音</a>。）</p></li><li><p>该网站/应用程序目前看起来有点慢/不稳定，但总体来说还不错，而且看起来仍然比 Mastodon 更快。</p></li><li><p> Threads 在 100 多个国家/地区可用，但<a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/no-instagram-threads-app-in-the-eu-irish-dpc-says-metas-new-twitter-rival-wont-be-launched-here/a1927220337.html">由于欧盟严厉且令人困惑的《数字市场法案》</a> ，尚未在欧盟推出。欧盟似乎更有可能将其公民与更广阔的世界隔离，而不是强迫美国和亚洲公司遵守其法规。</p></li><li><p> ActivityPub 联盟尚不受支持，但即将推出。 Instagram 负责人<a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuRtcYTNY3J">Adam Mosseri 发帖称</a>：</p><blockquote><p>我们致力于在该应用程序中构建对 ActivityPub（Mastodon 背后的协议）的支持。由于去中心化网络带来的许多复杂性，我们无法完成它的发布，但它即将到来。</p><p>如果您想知道为什么这很重要，原因如下：您可能有一天会离开 Threads，或者希望不会，最终会脱离平台。如果发生这种情况，您应该能够将观众带到另一台服务器。开放可以实现这一点。</p></blockquote></li></ul><h2>我喜欢 Threads 的机会</h2><p>Threads 的整体氛围可能不适合我。它并不疯狂，但很忙碌，而且非常流行文化。如果你是那种想要一个安静的时间线，只包含来自精心策划的帐户的帖子的人，那么 Threads 不适合你，而且可能永远不会适合你。但喜欢 Twitter 的“For You”提要和侧边栏中的热门话题的人可能会发现 Threads 更有趣。</p><p>因此，我看好 Threads 取得长期成功的机会：</p><ol><li>世界需要，或者至少想要像 Twitter 这样的东西。</li><li>在马斯克的领导下，推特本身正在分崩离析。</li><li> Mastodon 本质上对于大众市场的采用来说太混乱了，而且如果没有一些中央权威介入并强加解决方案就无法修复，这违背了联邦宇宙的精神。这并不意味着乳齿象注定要失败或很糟糕。只是它永远不会获得主流的欢迎。</li><li> Bluesky（我个人支持的那个）在扩展并继续定义其底层协议时仍然只接受邀请。</li><li>所有其他像 Twitter 一样的新贵，比如<a href="https://post.news/">Post</a>和<a href="https://t2.social/">T2</a>以及其他任何人都没有任何吸引力。</li><li> Threads 始于 10 亿符合条件的用户，他们已经拥有自己的用户名，并且可以选择关注他们在 Instagram 中关注的完全相同的人，这是一个持续蓬勃发展并受到人们喜爱的产品。</li><li> Facebook 和 Instagram 知道如何在尽可能高的规模上运营——无论是技术上还是内容审核方面。 Instagram的内容审核记录远非完美， <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/11/20/masnicks-impossibility-theorem-content-moderation-scale-is-impossible-to-do-well/">但大规模的内容审核不可能做到完美</a>。 Facebook does it better than anyone, and much better than Twitter.</li></ol><p> I even like the name “Threads” — it&#39;s short, easy to spell, memorable, makes for a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/threads-icon.png">clever icon/logo</a> , and even starts with a “T”, reminding people of Twitter. The word <em>tweet</em> has been a nice thing for Twitter to have stumbled onto. (They didn&#39;t coin it; <a href="https://furbo.org/2013/06/28/the-origin-of-tweet/" title="Craig Hockenberry: ‘The Origin of Tweet’">Twitterrific did</a> .) <em>Tweet</em> works both as a noun and verb and everyone in the world knows what it means, whether they use Twitter or not. I don&#39;t think <em>thread</em> is going to take off as a verb for Threads, but it&#39;s a great noun for posts, and it reinforces the notion that you&#39;re supposed to engage with posts by replying.</p><h2>别处</h2><p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/meta-unspools-threads">Casey Newton has an interview with Mosseri</a> at Platformer. Regarding the EU, Mosseri said:</p><blockquote><p> The more pressing concern at the moment is to launch Threads in all the countries where Meta wants to. It won&#39;t be available in the European Union to launch as Meta works to ensure that Threads complies with the EU&#39;s new data privacy regulations.</p><p> “That&#39;s just going to take a while, unfortunately — and I&#39;m particularly frustrated about this point, because I&#39;ve been living outside of the US for a year now,” said Mosseri, who has been working from London. “I&#39;ve been on a total kick with my teams about stop launching things in only a couple countries, and not in other countries. … But in this case, it was either we wait on the EU, or delay the launch by many, many, many months. And I was worried that our window would close, because timing is important.”</p></blockquote><p> Regarding the opportunity for Threads, as Twitter self destructs, Newton writes:</p><blockquote><p> When the competition is an app <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/06/30/cisgender-twitter-musk-suspension/">where “cisgender” is considered a slur</a> , Threads has an easy time standing out as an oasis of calm and civility.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor">Mosseri also granted an interview to Alex Heath at The Verge</a> , where he had a thoughtful answer to the question of why Threads is a standalone app:</p><blockquote><p> It was a hugely contentious debate internally. You could be in feed. You could be a separate tab. You could be a separate app. The challenge with text posts in feed is that the post and comment model just fundamentally does not support public discourse as well as the model that Twitter pioneered with tweets and replies. Treating replies as equal as opposed to subordinate somehow just allows for a very different and much more broad range of public conversations. People do post text to Instagram all the time, even though we don&#39;t support it first class, and we&#39;re experimenting with that, too. That&#39;s great, but I think it solves a much smaller use case than public discourse more broadly.</p><p> Then there&#39;s a separate app versus separate tab. Separate tab is tough. There&#39;s only so much stuff you can shove in the app. It&#39;s already feeling too complicated. We&#39;re trying to actually simplify right now, and so it&#39;s certainly working against that. And generally, when you build a separate tab, you find you want to push all that distribution through a feed invariably in order to bootstrap it. You kind of end up right back in that first problem.</p><p> A separate app is way less likely to succeed because you have to bootstrap a user base from very little or from nothing. But if you do it, if you succeed, the upside is so much more significant.</p></blockquote><p> Lastly, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230705/p27#a230705p27">Techmeme&#39;s exhaustive compilation of coverage and commentary</a> .</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Threads </title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.nylas.com/?utm_source=daring-fireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredemail&amp;utm_campaign=FY23Q2-daringfireball-rssfeed&amp;utm_content=2023-07-DSU" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uws" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/nylas_for_email_and_calendar_a" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40060</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-07-04T02:40:41Z</published><updated> 2023-07-05T19:47:41Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Threads, the ActivityPub-compatible Twitter clone from Instagram, briefly (and presumably inadvertently) was listed in the Google Play Store over the weekend.

<p>Matt Binder, reporting for Mashable:</p><blockquote><p> According to developers paying Twitter, since the switch over to Elon Musk&#39;s paid API subscription plans, Twitter&#39;s API has experienced frequent issues that make it extremely difficult to run their apps.</p><p> Twitter&#39;s API issues have frustrated developers in each of Twitter&#39;s new API access tiers. Those with Basic or Pro plans — paying $100 and $5000 a month for API access, respectively — have experienced unannounced changes to their plans, numerous bugs, and often receive zero customer support. And developers shelling out for Twitter&#39;s Enterprise API Plan, which starts at $42,000 per month, are experiencing sudden outages and disappointing service considering the money they&#39;re paying.</p><p> “Everything used to work fine before we started paying half a million per year,” shared one developer in a private Twitter developer group chat shared with Mashable.</p></blockquote><p> This is how Twitter is dealing with <em>paid</em> services.

<p>Matt Levine, in his Money Stuff column:</p><blockquote><p> Well, look, if <em>I</em> were the newly hired chief executive officer of a social media company, and if the directors and shareholders who brought me in as CEO had told me that my main mission was to turn around the company&#39;s precarious financial situation by improving our position with advertisers, and if I spent my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/technology/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino.html">first few weeks</a> reassuring advertisers and rebuilding relationships and talking up our site&#39;s unique audience and powerful engagement, and then one day my head of software engineering came to me and said “hey boss, too many people were too engaged with too many posts, so I had to limit everyone&#39;s ability to view posts on our site, just FYI,” I would ... probably ... fire ... him?</p><p> I mean I suppose I might ask questions like “Is this because of some technological limitation on our system?

<p>Ivan Mehta, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> Over the weekend, Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/01/twitter-imposes-limits-on-the-number-of-tweets-users-can-read-amid-extended-outage/">limited the number of tweets</a> users can read in a day, which he said was to prevent data scraping. While this measure has affected all Twitter users, TweetDeck users in particular are today reporting major problems, including notifications and entire columns failing to load.</p><p> Musk initially enforced read-limits of 6,000 daily posts for verified users and 600 daily posts for unverified users. Hours later, he increased these limits to 10,000 tweets and 1,000 tweets, respectively. Given that TweetDeck loads up multiple tweets through various columns simultaneously, it&#39;s likely that the effects of the read restrictions are amplified within TweetDeck.</p></blockquote><p> Needless to say it&#39;s rather nutty that a business whose primary revenue stream is advertising would institute rate limits at all, let alone severe limits that typical users bump up against <a href="https://mastodon.social/@julipuli/110650981176518772">in about 20 minutes of browsing</a> . Musk&#39;s thinking, one presumes, is that <em>this</em> is the masterstroke that will prompt people to sign up for Twitter Blue at $8-11/month.</p><p> The bigger, more fundamental change Musk instituted over the weekend is making it such that tweets aren&#39;t visible unless you&#39;re logged in to a Twitter account. This broke all sorts of things. Messaging apps (like Apple&#39;s Messages) can no longer render preview cards for tweets, for one thing. Closer to home, it broke <a href="https://twitter.com/daringfireball">the @daringfireball auto-posting account</a> . More amusingly, <a href="https://sfba.social/@sysop408/110639474671754723">as documented by Sheldon Chang</a> , this change completely broke Twitter itself — some part of the Rube Goldberg-ian machine that assembles users&#39; timeline feeds was itself subjected to these rate limits, so Twitter wound up DDOSing itself. It&#39;s like a gasoline company instituting rations that stranded its own fleet of tanker trucks.</p><p> From its <a href="https://medium.com/social-media-help/first-tweet-f2f0530cfa2d">inception</a> through this weekend, Twitter has been like blogging, insofar as tweets being public. You visit the URL for a tweet, you see the tweet. Now it&#39;s a walled garden, like most of Facebook, available only to logged-in users. I suspect this change will prevent the Internet Archive from caching tweets, too. That just sucks.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Everything Continues to Be Going Just Great at Twitter’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/everything-continues-to-be-going-just-great-at-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WSJ: &#39;Goldman Is Looking for a Way Out of Its Partnership With Apple&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-is-looking-for-a-way-out-of-its-partnership-with-apple-79849a91" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwo" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40056</id><published> 2023-07-03T17:00:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-03T21:53:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AKAekQoCCQE2082_Qekyo0g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The Wall Street firm is in talks with American Express to take over its Apple credit card and other ventures with the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldman went public with plans to scale back its consumer business late last year, but it appeared committed to the Apple relationship. The bank recently extended the partnership through the end of the decade, agreed to support Apple&#39;s “buy now, pay later” offering and launched a bank account with the tech company.</p><p> Now it is in talks to offload those businesses and its credit-card partnership to Amex, according to people familiar with the discussions. A deal with Amex isn&#39;t imminent or assured, people familiar with the conversations said, and it could take a while to transfer the partnership in any case. Apple would have to agree to a transfer. The tech company is aware of the talks, which have been ongoing for months, the people said. [...]</p><p> In January, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-lost-3-billion-on-consumer-lending-push-11673616202?mod=article_inline">Goldman disclosed that it had lost about $3 billion</a> on the consumer-lending push since 2020.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s unclear how much of Goldman&#39;s losses in their consumer banking foray are attributable to the Apple Card specifically, but Sridhar Natarajan reported for Bloomberg <sup>*</sup> back in January <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-13/goldman-lost-1-2-billion-in-just-nine-months-in-newest-division">that it&#39;s the source of <em>most</em> of their losses</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The division&#39;s $1 billion pretax loss reported for 2021 was mostly tied to the Apple Card, people with knowledge of the numbers said. And about $2 billion in 2022 mainly stems from the Apple card and installment-lending platform GreenSky, the people said.</p></blockquote><p> How you lose money issuing credit cards that charge usurious interest rates is beyond me. Not quite in the territory of Donald Trump somehow losing money while running casinos, but it&#39;s up there. Are they issuing Apple Cards to deadbeats? (Apparently, yes: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/goldmans-gs-apple-card-business-has-a-surprising-subprime-problem.html">they&#39;ve been issuing a lot of cards to people with bad credit</a> .)</p><p> If Goldman does bail, AmEx would be as good a partner as any for Apple: they know how to deliver a premium experience <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/american-express-ceo-says-the-business-is-firing-on-all-cylinders-fe875f3d">and turn a good profit doing so</a> .</p><p> <small>* <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con">You know</a> .</small></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘WSJ: ‘Goldman Is Looking for a Way Out of Its Partnership With Apple’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Astra Carta Seal </title><link href="https://www.sustainable-markets.org/astra-carta/astra-carta-seal/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/astra-carta-seal" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40053</id><published> 2023-07-03T16:26:59Z</published><updated> 2023-07-03T16:29:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Pangrams, of course, are sentences that contain each letter of the alphabet at least once, of which <em>the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</em> is surely the most famous. Lettering artists of the previous generation bequeathed us <em>jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz;</em> puzzlers are fond of the impossibly compact <em>Mr Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx</em> for its 26-letter world record. Sometime in the early nineties, I whiled away an entire afternoon in a San Francisco café coming up with a bunch of my own, honoring typeface designers <em>(mix Zapf with Veljović and get quirky Béziers),</em> and philosophers <em>(you go tell that vapid existentialist quack Freddy Nietzsche that he can just bite me, twice),</em> and the uplifting grace of a cosmos in balance <em>(Wham! Volcano erupts fiery liquid death onto ex-jazzbo Kenny G.)</em> Pangrams are unctuous little brain ticklers, challenging to concoct, droll to read, and immensely popular for presenting fonts.</p><p> I find them singularly useless in type design, and I don&#39;t use them in my work.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hoefler’s Proof for Testing Fonts’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/30/hoeflers-proof">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Womprat: &#39;The Font You&#39;re Looking For&#39; </title><link href="http://womprat.xyz/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwe" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/womprat" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40046</id><published> 2023-06-30T01:24:54Z</published><updated> 2023-06-30T02:50:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>On another end of the new font spectrum, Womprat — designed by Louie Mantia, engineered by Ender Smith — is every bit as <em>Star Wars</em> -y, if not more so, than any typography from Lucasfilm itself.

<p>Lindsey Adler, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p><blockquote><p> Before the season began, New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán changed his jersey number from 55 to 0. It turned out to be a prescient move. On Wednesday night, Germán became just the 24th pitcher in MLB history to throw a perfect game, using just 99 pitches to mow through 27 Oakland A&#39;s batters without allowing a single baserunner.</p><p> Entering the game with a 5.10 ERA in his first 14 starts of the season, Germán completed the first perfect game since Félix Hernández threw one for the Mariners in August 2012. There were three perfectos thrown that year — by Hernández, Matt Cain, and Phillip Humber — but nearly 11 seasons had passed without one occurring.</p><p> “Growing up, [Hernández] was my idol,” Germán said through a translator after the game. “I really looked up to the way he pitched.”</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Domingo Germán Throws the 24th Perfect Game in MLB History’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/german-perfecto">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> LoveFrom Serif </title><link href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90888571/jony-ive-spent-the-last-4-years-perfecting-his-typeface-heres-why-hell-never-be-done" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwc" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/lovefrom-serif" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40044</id><published> 2023-06-29T22:39:22Z</published><updated> 2023-07-03T17:16:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Wilson, in a profile back in April for Fast Company about the creation of LoveFrom Serif, a new font family designed by many of the designers behind Apple&#39;s remarkable San Francisco family:</p><blockquote><p> Serifs (think Times New Roman) became the focus instead, and after an exhaustive search, LoveFrom designer Antonio Cavedoni landed on Baskerville as a source of inspiration. The typeface is one everyone has seen, so it would be quietly familiar, even timeless. But it has enough expressive components that it could live in many contexts. Just as great of an appeal was the historical context of John Baskerville himself.</p><p> “John Baskerville as a person, as a craftsperson, was uncannily similar in his obsessiveness and his character to those of us at LoveFrom,” Ive says. “And that really, in a very natural way, became the starting point for developing our own typeface.”</p><p> Baskerville was indeed obsessive, Cavedoni explains. As we wrote in our story on the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90693444/jony-ives-first-major-design-since-leaving-apple-isnt-what-youd-expect">Terra Carta</a> , Baskerville first made his money in “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanning">japanned</a> ” lacquerwork items. As he reached his 40s, he had the resources to go heads-down on his passion for word-making. As a trained calligrapher, he wanted to elevate the quality of book printing. He obsessed over not just the design of his typeface Baskerville but of the crafted execution of the individual metal “punches” that pressed each letter to ensure the printing was sharp. He even <a href="https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1761.htm">formulated</a> an improved ink, and learned he could place woven paper into hot brass cylinders to give it a glossy finish.</p></blockquote><p> A type designer who veered into innovations in ink formulation and paper finishing — yes, that sounds like a kindred spirit to Ive and his colleagues.</p><p> The entirety of Steve Jobs&#39;s <em>Make Something Wonderful</em> — both on the web and in the limited print editions — is, unsurprisingly, typeset in LoveFrom. Before that, I&#39;d only encountered LoveFrom Serif in small doses, and typically at display sizes (like <a href="https://www.lovefrom.com/">the LoveFrom website&#39;s home page</a> ). Turns out it&#39;s quite good — traditional but distinctive — as a long-form text face. Broadly speaking, most people perceive serif fonts as more formal, sans serifs more casual. LoveFrom Serif feels like a friendly, emotionally warm serif, but which cedes no ground on formality and structure. British, for sure, but somehow with a welcome whiff of California. It&#39;s clearly derived from Baskerville, but evokes a different feel, particularly at text sizes, than the eponymous Baskerville <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/">that ships</a> on Apple platforms.</p><p> Cavedoni presented a lecture just this week entitled “ <a href="https://letterformarchive.org/shop/unexpected-baskerville-the-story-of-lovefrom-serif/">Unexpected Baskerville: The Story of LoveFrom Serif</a> ”, at San Francisco&#39;s Main Public Library. It pains me to have missed <a href="https://typo.social/@typographica/110630124570983807">what appears</a> to have been a remarkable presentation, with noteworthy guests and historic books, but a video recording is forthcoming “later this year”.</p><p> <strong>Postscript:</strong> I&#39;ve been sitting on this link for a few weeks, partly because, well, I do that, but also because I wanted to let the experience of having read <em>Make Something Wonderful</em> settle in. That book, to me, is LoveFrom Serif&#39;s true debut. If you want to exercise a typeface, set a book in it. It has occurred to me several times during this stretch how much <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen">I miss Dean Allen</a> , and specifically, herewith, I crave his thoughts on both the typeface and the book. Re-reading for the umpteenth time <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103090824/http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=7">Twenty Faces</a></em> , Dean&#39;s remarkably <a href="https://twitter.com/verbosus/status/954452524379131904">concise and compelling</a> “survey of available text typefaces”, I was reminded that his entry on ITC Baskerville points also to <a href="https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves">Mrs Eaves</a> , Zuzana Licko&#39;s inspired 1996 revival (has it been that long? I will forever think of Mrs Eaves as a “new” typeface), which Dean described thus: “an interesting if mannered experiment in reviving Baskerville by aping the unpredictability of form found in letterpress text.”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘LoveFrom Serif’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/lovefrom-serif">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/apple_silo_twitter" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwb" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40043</id><published> 2023-06-28T22:40:39Z</published><updated> 2023-07-05T22:27:03Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> It&#39;s hard not to think that Twitter, bereft of premium brand advertisers and looking to jumpstart its foray into hosting long-form video content, is getting more from this *Silo* promotion than Apple is getting from newfound viewers. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1673730750095712256">Apple TV, yesterday on Twitter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> 3 days until the #Silo finale.</p><p> Here&#39;s the entire first episode.</p></blockquote><p> Embedded right in that promoted tweet is the entire series premiere. <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-28"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-28">1</a></sup></p><p> Putting aside, for this paragraph, the politics surrounding Twitter, this is a rather interesting promotional move. You can watch the premiere episodes for all Apple TV+ original series for free in the Apple TV app: <em>Silo</em> , <em>Ted Lasso</em> , <em>Severance</em> , <em>The Morning Show</em> , <em>Hijack</em> (the new thriller starring Idris Elba) — all of them. It&#39;s an obvious strategy: get hooked on even one of these premieres and it costs just $7/month to watch the rest. The biggest obstacle to any streaming service is just getting someone to <em>try</em> it. Everyone with an iPhone or iPad or Mac already has Apple&#39;s TV app installed, and a lot of people already have the app on their TVs or set top boxes. But Apple isn&#39;t linking from Twitter to the TV+ app — they&#39;ve shared the entire episode right on Twitter itself. Not YouTube, not Facebook.推特。 That wasn&#39;t even technically possible <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/twitter-now-allows-paid-users-to-upload-two-hour-long-videos/">until last month</a> .</p><p> But asking anyone today to put aside the politics of Twitter is a bit like the old “ <em>But other than that, how&#39;d you enjoy the play, Mrs. Lincoln?</em> ” joke. There is a number one user on Twitter, and that user is Elon Musk, and his politics and policies are veering<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4061600-musk-says-cis-cisgender-considered-slurs-on-twitter/">more toxic</a> , not less, as time goes on. Advertising is fundamentally about paying to reach an audience, not an endorsement of content, but at some level it&#39;s a partnership. Publishers and platforms reject objectionable ads, and advertisers eschew objectionable platforms. Where is that line for Apple with Twitter?</p><p> Musk, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1673831774038949888">seems exultant</a> over Apple&#39;s <em>Silo</em> promotion, which includes a custom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/wwdc-2023-hashflag/">hashflag</a> icon. And here&#39;s no less an influencer than MrBeast, Jimmy Donaldson, <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1673850123967770624">replying to Musk</a> : “Really is a smart move, I never would have heard of this show and now I&#39;m watching episode 1 and invested lol.” If you&#39;re wondering why Apple would even <em>consider</em> continuing to advertise on Twitter, there&#39;s your answer: the platform still has tremendous reach.</p><p> Apple spends a veritable fortune on advertising across a slew of media. But the only place where I see anyone asking “Why is Apple advertising <em>there</em> ?” is Twitter. It&#39;s hard not to think that Twitter, bereft of premium brand advertisers and looking to jumpstart its foray into hosting long-form video content, is getting more from this <em>Silo</em> promotion than Apple is getting from newfound viewers. It&#39;s not the money (which Musk has plenty of), it&#39;s the prestige (of which Twitter is by most accounts bankrupt). You can&#39;t buy prestige, and Apple has chosen to bestow some on Twitter through this promotion. Is it <em>outrageous</em> that Apple continues to advertise on Twitter? I say no. But it feels a bit skeevy, and more than a little curious, that they choose to.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-28"><p> I started watching <em>Silo</em> a few weeks ago and I like it a lot. Season one does a good job revealing a bit more of the overall mystery each week, while simultaneously doling out some answers along the way. Strong premise, good cast, good production values. It&#39;s no <em>Severance</em> but it&#39;s really good. (I feel the same way about <em>Foundation</em> , but I like <em>Silo</em> better.) It&#39;s a good show and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/silo-renewed-season-2-apple-1235643158/">already been renewed for a second season</a> .

<p>Ron Amadeo, writing for Ars Technica:</p><blockquote><p> I didn&#39;t do anything to deserve this. The phone sat on my desk while I wrote about it, and I would occasionally stop to poke the screen, take a screenshot, or open and close it. It was never dropped or exposed to a significant amount of grit, nor had it gone through the years of normal wear and tear that phones are expected to survive. This was the lightest possible usage of a phone, and it still broke.</p><p> The flexible OLED screen died after four days. The bottom 10 pixels of the Pixel Fold went dead first, forming a white line of 100 percent brightness pixels that blazed across the bottom of the screen. The entire left half of the foldable display stopped responding to touch, too, and an hour later, a white gradient started growing upward across the display. [...]</p><p> Manufacturers keep wanting to brush off the significant durability issues of flexible OLED displays, thinking that if they just shove the devices onto the market, everything will work out. That hasn&#39;t been the case, though, and any time you see a foldable phone for sale, you don&#39;t have to look far to see reports of dead displays. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see several reports of broken Pixel Folds once the unit hits the general public.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/pixel-fold-review">Earlier today</a> I described the market for foldables as a niche (people willing to spend nearly $2,000) within a niche (people willing to buy any phone that doesn&#39;t support using a protective case) within a niche (people who want a foldable phone in the first place).

<p>Ploum, in a piece titled “How to Kill a Decentralised Network (Such as the Fediverse)”:</p><blockquote><p> In 2013, Google realised that most XMPP interactions were between Google Talk users anyway. They didn&#39;t care about respecting a protocol they were not 100% in control. So they pulled the plug and announced they would not be federated anymore. And started a long quest to create a messenger, starting with Hangout (which was followed by Allo, Duo. I lost count after that). [...]</p><p> While XMPP still exist and is a very active community, it never recovered from this blow. Too high expectation with Google adoption led to a huge disappointment and a silent fall into oblivion. XMPP became niche. So niche that when group chats became all the rage (Slack, Discord), the free software community reinvented it (Matrix) to compete while group chats were already possible with XMPP. (Disclaimer: I&#39;ve never studied the Matrix protocol so I have no idea how it technically compares with XMPP. I simply believe that it solves the same problem and compete in the same space as XMPP).</p><p> Would XMPP be different today if Google never joined it or was never considered as part of it? Nobody could say. But I&#39;m convinced that it would have grown slower and, maybe, healthier. That it would be bigger and more important than it is today. That it would be the default decentralised communication platform. One thing is sure: if Google had not joined, XMPP would not be worse than it is today.</p></blockquote><p> This is in the context of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/more_on_preemptively_blocking">the situation with Mastodon and Facebook&#39;s upcoming “Threads” project</a> , and the subset of Mastodon instance admins who are pledging preemptively to block it. Basically it&#39;s an argument that Google applied Microsoft&#39;s old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish strategy</a> to kill XMPP, and that thus XMPP is a better example than email when debating whether large scale federated protocols should allow large corporate instances to join.</p><p> I don&#39;t buy it. XMPP is an instant messaging protocol. Instant messaging is effectively dead. AIM is gone and I learned only while writing this post that ICQ is apparently still around. All modern messaging protocols have some form of message persistence; instant messaging did not. With instant messaging you could only send a message to someone while they were logged in with the client app open and running. You can&#39;t prove a negative, but I see no scenario where XMPP would have any relevance today, regardless of Google&#39;s decisions a decade ago.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Sorry, but XMPP Was Doomed, Not Extinguished by Google’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/xmpp-google">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/ftc_amazon_prime" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw8" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40040</id><published> 2023-06-27T00:22:54Z</published><updated> 2023-07-03T20:18:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> I&#39;d be all in favor of the FTC pursuing and enforcing laws that require *all* subscription services to have clear, discoverable cancellation options online. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Their argument that Amazon has made it difficult to cancel a Prime subscription is just wrong. Yes, it&#39;s a few more clicks than it takes to sign up for Prime, but I don&#39;t think any of those steps are arduous or unnecessary or unfair or confusing. And in the context of Amazon&#39;s entire website — <a href="https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/amazon-website">infamously sprawling</a> — it&#39;s really rather <em>easy</em> to find.</p><p> The FTC might have a better case that Amazon has used deceptive dark patterns to get people to <em>sign up</em> for Prime, but I don&#39;t find their case compelling. (Note, however, my above remark that their complaint is heavily redacted. Perhaps some of the redactions cover essential evidence.) But it fails the sniff test in one regard: I&#39;ve never once heard of anyone complaining that they were tricked into a Prime membership that they didn&#39;t knowingly sign up for. I&#39;ve seen people complaining about how hard it is to cancel all sorts of other subscriptions and memberships. Cable TV providers like Comcast make it really hard to cut the cord. Gyms are notorious for requiring you to cancel a membership in person. And The New York Times only recently began allowing subscribers to cancel over the web, rather than calling and talking to a human whose job it is to <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/new-york-times-writer-unwittingly-calls-out-manipulative-design-at-his-own-paper-99e50c660d59">talk you out of cancelling</a> .

I&#39;ve never seen anyone complain about this.</p><p> It&#39;s way easier to cancel a Prime membership than most subscriptions. And most of the steps the FTC delineates are reasonable “Are you sure?” precautions. It&#39;s like complaining that it takes a few more steps to empty the Trash in MacOS (or Recycle Bin on Windows) than it does to create a new file or folder — destructive actions <em>should</em> take a few extra steps.</p><p> I&#39;d be all in favor of the FTC pursuing and enforcing laws that require <em>all</em> subscription services to have clear, discoverable cancellation options online. In fact, it seems ridiculous that the FTC hasn&#39;t already done this. But singling out Amazon only makes sense insofar as that Lina Khan made a name for herself as a critic of the company.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/amazon-friction-and-the-ftc/">Ben Thompson, today at Stratechery</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This, to my mind, is the chief reason why this complaint rubs me the wrong way: even if there is validity to the FTC&#39;s complaints (more on this in a moment), the overall thrust of the Prime value proposition seems overwhelmingly positive for consumers; surely there are plenty of other products and subscriptions that aren&#39;t just bad for consumers on the edges but also in their overall value proposition and reason for existing.</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ FTC Sues Amazon, Claiming &#39;Deceptive&#39; Prime Sign-Up and Cancellation Process</title></entry><entry><title> Allison Johnson Reviews the $1,800 Google Pixel Fold </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/23773594/google-pixel-fold-review-screen-battery-hinge-camera" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/pixel-fold-review" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40038</id><published> 2023-06-26T21:41:56Z</published><updated> 2023-06-27T22:20:00Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Allison Johnson, writing for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Google has optimized a bunch of its own apps to work in the Fold&#39;s unfolded tablet mode, and they&#39;re great. Gmail, YouTube, Photos — they all make use of the full screen by putting information in sidebars and vertical columns. Chrome has a desktop-like interface, complete with tabs at the top of the window and the ability to load the full versions of websites. Google Meet readily moved a tiled view of attendees to the top part of the screen when I set the phone up in an L-shape, sliding the controls to the bottom half of the display. I didn&#39;t have to fiddle with anything — it just worked.</p><p> A lot of third-party apps don&#39;t take advantage of the whole inner screen, though, which stinks. Instagram is just a phone-sized app with black bars on either side. Same with Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and even Google-owned Fitbit. You can double-tap the blank space on either side to quickly slide the app to the left, right, or middle, which is nice. TikTok plays its vertical videos in the middle of the screen but at least uses the extra space on either side to move all the text that&#39;s usually right on top of the video out of the way. Even so, it feels like a lot of wasted space when you&#39;re not watching a video or multitasking.</p></blockquote><p> This form factor seems more appealing to me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">than flip phones</a> , but still, I have not an iota of envy from my perch on the iPhone side of the fence. It&#39;s good that Google has tweaked so many of its own Android apps to fully embrace the tablet-sized folded-out screen, but if most of the third-party apps you most use don&#39;t, that seems like the end of the discussion right there.</p><p> It&#39;s a classic chicken-and-egg problem: third-party developers aren&#39;t going to spend time embracing these foldable screens unless there are a lot of phones in use sporting them, but users aren&#39;t likely to buy them until there&#39;s widespread support for them in the apps they use most. If this is a great form factor then Google should stand behind it with a push that declares that foldable screens are the future of Android, or at least the future of Pixel phones. Otherwise it all seems like a waste of time.</p><p> The other problem, I&#39;ll reiterate, is cases. The overwhelming majority of people put their phones in protective cases. The more expensive a phone is, the more likely people will see the need to “protect” it with a case. This phone starts at $1,800 for 256 GB of storage, and costs $1,919 for 512 GB. (The iPhone 14 Pro costs $1,200/$1,400 for the same amounts of storage.) But foldable phones can&#39;t be put in cases. They&#39;re targeting a niche within a niche within a niche — people willing to spend $1,800 on a phone, without using a case, with a foldable display.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out, there <em>are</em> cases for the Pixel Fold: <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_fold_case?hl=en-US">a $60 silicone case from Google itself</a> , and a “coming soon” <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/leather-case-for-pixel-fold">leather one from Bellroy</a> . <strong>Another Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel-fold-case-collection">Some cases from Spigen</a> , starting at $60, and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-google-pixel-fold-cases/">a collection from Android Police of others</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Allison Johnson Reviews the $1,800 Google Pixel Fold’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/pixel-fold-review">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Inside the AI Factory: The Humans That Make Tech Seem Human&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/inside-the-ai-factory" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40037</id><published> 2023-06-26T21:02:52Z</published><updated> 2023-06-26T21:10:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Josh Dzieza, in a splendid investigative report co-published by The Verge <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html">and New York Magazine</a> :</p><blockquote><p> For Joe&#39;s students, it was work stripped of all its normal trappings: a schedule, colleagues, knowledge of what they were working on or whom they were working for. In fact, they rarely called it work at all — just “tasking.” They were taskers.</p><p> The anthropologist David Graeber defines “bullshit jobs” as employment without meaning or purpose, work that should be automated but for reasons of bureaucracy or status or inertia is not. These AI jobs are their bizarro twin: work that people want to automate, and often think is already automated, yet still requires a human stand-in. The jobs have a purpose; it&#39;s just that workers often have no idea what it is. [...]</p><p> This tangled supply chain is deliberately hard to map. According to people in the industry, the companies buying the data demand strict confidentiality. (This is the reason Scale cited to explain why Remotasks has a different name.) Annotation reveals too much about the systems being developed, and the huge number of workers required makes leaks difficult to prevent. Annotators are warned repeatedly not to tell anyone about their jobs, not even their friends and co-workers, but corporate aliases, project code names, and, crucially, the extreme division of labor ensure they don&#39;t have enough information about them to talk even if they wanted to. (Most workers requested pseudonyms for fear of being booted from the platforms.) Consequently, there are no granular estimates of the number of people who work in annotation, but it is a lot, and it is growing. A recent Google Research paper gave an order-of-magnitude figure of “millions” with the potential to become “billions.”</p></blockquote><p> Evocative artwork by Richard Parry accompanying the piece at The Verge, too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Inside the AI Factory: The Humans That Make Tech Seem Human’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/inside-the-ai-factory">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://l.kolide.co/3JWbXEv" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/25/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40036</id><published> 2023-06-25T21:50:09Z</published><updated> 2023-06-25T21:50:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Neil Long, writing at Mobilegamer.biz, has an interesting interview with Phillip Shoemaker, who ran App Store review at Apple from 2009 to 2016:</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s app review process remains a huge problem for mobile game-makers as they navigate vague guidelines and inconsistent rulings. So we asked Shoemaker for his thoughts on how Apple can fix it:</p><p> “The way to solve that inconsistency — and I hate to say it — is: let&#39;s take a page from Google,” he told us. “Especially now with the AI tools that are out there. You can do probably 80% of the work the review team does.”</p></blockquote><p> In the era of app stores, it&#39;s seemed pretty clear that Apple&#39;s has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/03/teabot-data-steal-google-play/">fewer problems with malware slipping through</a> than <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-password-stealing-malware-infects-100-000-google-play-users/">Google&#39;s</a> . I&#39;m not aware of a single iOS developer who doesn&#39;t think the App Store, especially review, can and should be improved in numerous ways. But neither “ <em>make it more like the Play Store</em> ” nor “ <em>use AI for review</em> ” sounds right to me.</p><p> Also, App Store review times have decreased from an average of about 5 days to 1 day since Shoemaker left Apple in 2016. (And my understanding is that new automation tools are a big part of that process improvement. Shoemaker&#39;s gripes about App Store review seem stuck in 2016.)</p><blockquote><p> Schiller appears to be the last holdout when it comes to automating app review compared to Apple SVPs Eddy Cue, Greg &#39;Joz&#39; Joswiak and App Store VP Matt Fischer. “I think the way to radically improve the App Store is have Phil be an Apple fellow and get his hands off the App Store,” says Shoemaker. “That&#39;s what they really need to do. Eddy&#39;s more progressive, Joz is more progressive, and we know Matt is as well. Phil just needs to get his meaty paws off the App Store.”</p><p> “If Phil doesn&#39;t step back, it&#39;ll absolutely be the courts making changes,” Shoemaker continues.</p></blockquote><p> If I worked at Apple I&#39;d print up a “Meaty Paws” sign and tape it to Schiller&#39;s door.</p><blockquote><p> “Phil needs to step back, I think that&#39;s the main thing — new blood needs to come in there and make some changes because cutting the price and opening up the guidelines to allow new interesting things is going to be critical.”</p></blockquote><p> Phil Schiller, of course, is the executive <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">who suggested decreasing Apple&#39;s rake in a memo back in 2011</a> .</p><blockquote><p> “It was tough working for Phil…he was one of those guys that would love to throw insults at people, right? I mean he had no boundaries — he&#39;d insult your children and you&#39;re like: &#39;Why am I working at this company again?&#39;”</p><p> Shoemaker would regularly get feedback from his kids on apps and games and use that feedback in the ERB meetings. “Phil would say things like, oh, that&#39;s a stupid thing to say, are your kids that dumb? And you&#39;re like, are you freaking kidding me?”</p></blockquote><p> Seems like the two Phils did not get along. No word from Shoemaker on whether <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/apple-fart-apps/">iWiz is coming back to the App Store</a> , either.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Former App Store Review Lead Phillip Shoemaker Seems to Have an Oddly Personal Grudge Against Phil Schiller’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/shoemaker-schiller">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Why Has Mastodon Adoption Stalled? </title><link href="https://blog.bloonface.com/2023/06/12/why-did-the-twittermigration-fail/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw1" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40033</id><published> 2023-06-23T19:05:11Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T19:05:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Bloonface, in a thoughtful post regarding the stagnation in growth in the Fediverse:</p><blockquote><p> Mastodon is at risk of falling into the trap that a lot of free/open source software does, where the idea of the software being “free as in speech” is expected to outweigh or explain away deficiencies in its usefulness. However, this ignores three salient facts:</p><ul><li><p> Most people don&#39;t give a thruppenny fuck about their freedom to view and edit the source code of the software they use, which they would not know how to do even if they cared;</p></li><li><p> Most people are not ideologically opposed to the notion of proprietary software, and cannot be convinced to be because it is simply not important to them and cannot be explained in terms that are important to them;和</p></li><li><p>When given the choice between a tool which is immediately useful for achieving some sort of goal but conflicts with some kind of ideological standpoint, and a tool which is not as useful but they agree with ideologically, they will probably choose the former.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> After Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter <a href="https://fedidb.org/">there was an initial burst of new users and increased usage</a> on Mastodon (and the rest of the Fediverse, but mostly this is about Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter). And then it flattened, and perhaps has even declined.</p><p> I would like to see Mastodon thrive. But the platform&#39;s ideological zealotry is obviously holding it back and seemingly isn&#39;t going to change. That&#39;s why I&#39;m much more optimistic about Bluesky&#39;s long-term prospects. Six weeks later and I feel stronger than ever about <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314523447694321">this quip I posted in early May</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Bluesky: “If you liked Twitter, you&#39;ll love Bluesky.”</p><p> Mastodon: “If you hated Twitter, you&#39;ll like Mastodon.”</p><p> Hundreds of millions of people liked what Twitter once was, and what it aspired to be. Bluesky might be that.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Why Has Mastodon Adoption Stalled?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WebKit on VisionOS Will Support Open WebXR Content </title><link href="https://www-roadtovr-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-webxr-support-safari-model/amp/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw0" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/webkit-visionos-webxr" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40032</id><published> 2023-06-23T18:38:27Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T21:43:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ben Lang, writing for Road to VR:</p><blockquote><p> In a somewhat surprising move, Apple confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will support WebXR. Prior to the reveal of the headset, it was an open question whether the company would entertain the idea of XR experiences through the browser, and even more so if the company would adopt the relatively new <a href="https://immersiveweb.dev/">WebXR standard</a> . But now Apple has confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will indeed support WebXR.</p><p> The company confirmed as much in its WWDC 2023 developer talk titled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10279/">Meet Safari for Spatial Computing</a> , in which Apple explained the version of Safari running on Vision Pro “truly is Safari with the same WebKit engine underneath, plus some thoughtful additions for [Vision Pro].”</p><p> Thanks to Safari on visionOS being a fully-featured version of the browser, existing websites should work exactly as expected, the company says. But to go beyond flat web pages, Safari on visionOS includes support for WebXR for immersive experiences and the new <code>&lt;model>;</code> tag for 3D models.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find this surprising at all. Apple has always embraced open content and the web, to the extent that it makes sense in the overall platform experience. Web browsing on mobile phones was practically non-existent before the iPhone.

<p>Ian Betteridge:</p><blockquote><p> What defines Mastodon is not the use of a protocol. The protocol is just an enabler. Instead, Mastodon is defined by allowing communities (instances) freedom of association. <em>It is the ability of communities to choose not to federate with anyone else which gives Mastodon its strength.</em></p></blockquote><p> His whole post is thoughtful and considered, and worth your attention. Betteridge largely disagrees with me on this issue, and while he hasn&#39;t changed my mind, I&#39;m happy to direct your attention to his arguments.</p><p> But I do disagree with this:</p><blockquote><p> If you want to understand why some communities are wary of Meta, it&#39;s worth remembering how ActivityPub works. Let&#39;s say I run an instance called EvilMole.social. If I don&#39;t defederate (block) Meta&#39;s server, any user on their server and any user on EvilMole can follow each other. So suppose that @molesworth@evilmole.social follows @billy@meta.social.会发生什么？</p><p> First, every single one of Molesworth&#39;s posts are now available to Meta, including <em>all</em> the replies they make to everyone <em>including people who don&#39;t follow anyone on Meta&#39;s server</em> . In other words, Meta gets access to posts from people who may very well have an issue with that.</p></blockquote><p> If you don&#39;t want Meta (or Google, or whoever) to see your posts, then no matter which instance you&#39;re on, and which other servers your instance chooses to federate with, you need to make your account private. If you&#39;re posting publicly on any Mastodon server, everything you post is visible to the world, including Meta. If your account isn&#39;t private, you&#39;re posting to the open web.

<p>Jake Kanter, writing for Deadline:</p><blockquote><p> A six-month-old CBS report on OceanGate&#39;s Titanic tourism submarine is going viral on social media after reporter David Pogue raised safety concerns about the now-missing vessel.</p><p> Pogue visited OceanGate&#39;s operations last year and was submerged in the $1M submarine, named Titan, which vanished off the coast of Canada on Sunday. It was carrying a pilot and four passengers, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush. [...]</p><p> “It seems like this submersible has some elements of MacGyvery jerry-rigged-ness. You are putting construction pipes as ballast,” Pogue said to Rush in an interview.</p><p> “I don&#39;t know if I would use that description,” Rush replied. He added that the OceanGate worked with Boeing and Nasa on the pressure vessel. “Everything else can fail. Your thrusters can go, your lights can go, you&#39;re still going to be safe.”</p><p> Pogue said he was nervous before boarding and revealed some of the contents of the waiver form he was required to sign. This described the submarine as an “experimental submersible vessel that has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body and could result in physical injury, disability, emotional trauma or death.”</p></blockquote><p> Hindsight is 20-20, blah blah blah, but there&#39;s no way you could have gotten me to go on this thing.

<p>My brief “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">Not That Kind of &#39;Open&#39;</a> ” piece yesterday <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230620/p9#a230620p9">struck a chord</a> for some.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@chrismessina/110573508557787120">Chris Messina</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Not federating is certainly a choice admins can make, but it&#39;s unlikely to have an impact considering that Threads is being bootstrapped off the Instagram social graph.</p><p> Would you rather keep the fediverse restricted to its current population of ~8M people or scale it to ~2.35B+?</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t think most Instagram users will even try Threads (or whatever it&#39;s going to be called). But a lot might. And “just sign in using your existing Instagram identity” is a powerful enticement. If you already have an Instagram account, you&#39;ll be able to jump right in. How to get started with Mastodon (or any of the other ActivityPub “Fediverse” platforms) has been an enormous obstacle to adoption. People find it confusing, and people don&#39;t like being confused. “Just use your Instagram identity” is not confusing at all.</p><p> I think there are a lot of long-time Mastodon users who <em>like</em> the fact that it isn&#39;t gaining mainstream traction, and want to keep it that way. But then don&#39;t call it “open”.</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110573756551776352">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s a weird own goal for various Mastodon admins who are running a decentralized social network based on interoperable protocols to pledge that they won&#39;t interoperate with services from existing social networks if built on the same open protocols.</p><p> It&#39;s not even the hypocrisy, it&#39;s just dumb and undermines the entire point of interoperable protocols.</p></blockquote><p> The hypocrisy irks me, but I think he&#39;s right that it&#39;s foolish too. The Mastodon server admins who are preemptively promising to defederate Threads are effectively guaranteeing that users on their instances will be isolated from a potential majority of users on the overall platform.</p><p> <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/19.html">Dave Winer, at Scripting News</a> :</p><blockquote><p> They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is — who&#39;s being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn&#39;t mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn&#39;t one of them. You have to <em>think</em> .</p><p> But here&#39;s some good news. There&#39;s no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it&#39;s probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is “really simple” and the benefit of federation is well known <em>to users</em> . That&#39;s been what&#39;s kept it from being pwned by bigco&#39;s all these years.</p></blockquote><p> I cited email as an example yesterday of big companies running big instances and not extinguishing the openness that made the platform great. Podcasting is maybe an even better example. I don&#39;t take podcasting&#39;s future for granted, but 20 years in, it&#39;s still thriving as an open medium, despite the presence of titanic players like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify. Ultimately the involvement of these big companies has made <em>open</em> podcasting far more popular and enduring than I ever would have imagined 20 years ago, because they brought podcasting to the mass market. And there are some roles that we need big centralized players to play even on an open platform. Apple&#39;s iTunes podcast directory, for example. Facebook&#39;s Threads app could be something akin to Apple Podcasts for Mastodon.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TNLNYC/110576140169004056">Tristan Louis</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The anti-Meta #Fedipact can only achieve one thing: make sure that #ActivityPub loses to the Bluesky protocol. Is that what people here want?</p><p> As an #openweb advocate, I don&#39;t.</p><p> Meta joining the Fediverse is like AOL joining the internet: something that will bring a mass amount of people in, create some friction, but ultimately make the net better as more people federating on #Mastodon, #kbin, #lemmy, #pixelfed and other parts of the Fediverse make open protocols that much stronger.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a> and <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> are to Reddit what Mastodon is to Twitter. Unsurprisingly, they&#39;re <a href="https://kbin.fediverse.observer/stats">both</a> <a href="https://lemmy.fediverse.observer/stats">seeing</a> an infusion of new users this month, but are both still tiny compared to Reddit.</p><p> One controversial aspect to this story is that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384207">Meta apparently invited the admins from several top Mastodon instances to brief them on their plans</a> , under NDA. <a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/110573363201929310">Tim Bray</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My take:</p><ol><li> The Fedi folks shouldn&#39;t have taken the NDA&#39;d meeting. Transparency is essential.</li><li> It is not reasonable to expect ethical behaviour from Meta. It should be assumed that that if they can profit by disemboweling the Fediverse, they will.</li><li> There is an opportunity to attract some of the ordinary decent humans on Meta because they don&#39;t know anything better exists.</li></ol><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t de-federate. But only by about 51/49.</p></blockquote><p> Of course such a meeting would be under NDA, for now. It&#39;s an unreleased and as-yet unannounced product. Meeting with Facebook under NDA isn&#39;t ipso facto wrong — although I do think the fact that they were invited shouldn&#39;t itself be part of the NDA. Transparency is essential, but transparency can come after Threads is actually announced. The idea that NDAs are inherently nefarious is just conspirational tinfoil-hat nonsense. (Tinfoil hat nonsense is, alas, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470">having a moment</a> .)</p><p> On point 2, I&#39;m fine with starting Facebook with two strikes against it. Put them on a short leash. They start fucking around, Mastodon instances should start de-federating from their product. I just don&#39;t see why they should be blocked preemptively. The whole point of an open protocol like ActivityPub is that no one can own it. I&#39;ll close this post with the same question I did <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">yesterday</a> : Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer. Others clearly disagree.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ More on Preemptively Blocking Facebook&#39;s Imminent ActivityPub Entry </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/the_talk_show_live_from_wwdc_2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv8" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40004</id><published> 2023-06-10T18:37:49Z</published><updated> 2023-06-12T00:20:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Back in San Jose&#39;s historic California Theatre for the first time since 2019, special guests John Ternus, Mike Rockwell, Craig Federighi, and Greg Joswiak join me to discuss the news and announcements from WWDC 2023. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
