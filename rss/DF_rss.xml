<p>埃里希·施瓦茨（Erich Schwartzel）和杰西卡·托克尔（Jessica Toonkel）在12月19日为《华尔街日报》报道，标题为“詹姆斯·邦德在哪里？与亚马逊一起被困在一个丑陋的僵局中”（<a href="https://apple.news/A4AvCvPCIScSH_SJzKGD7gQ">新闻+链接</a>）：</p><blockquote><p>亚马逊通过65亿美元购买Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio获得发行债券电影的权利将近三年，监督该专营权的家庭与电子商务巨头之间的关系几乎崩溃了。衰败的合作伙伴关系使一部新债券电影的任何近期希望 - 对好莱坞的亚马逊野心的黑眼界，因为在米高梅出售时，债券专营权代表了该公司支付的65亿美元的大量份额工作室。</p><p>当涉及到邦德的未来时，权力就在于芭芭拉·西兰花（Barbara Broccoli）的手中，芭芭拉（Barbara Broccoli）从父亲阿尔伯特·“库比（Albert“ Cubby” Broccoli）继承了控制权，他已经决定了何时一部新邦德电影可以投入制作。她告诉朋友，她不相信以算法为中心的亚马逊，她的角色通过大屏幕的讲故事和直觉来帮助神话化。今年秋天，她以可怕的方式描述了一部新电影的地位 - 没有剧本，没有故事，也没有新的纽带。</p><p>对朋友来说，西兰花已经描述了她在亚马逊上的想法：“这些人在他妈的白痴。”</p></blockquote><p>显然，从僵局中出来的一种方法是出售。这是西兰花今天的公开声明， <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/global/james-bond-amazon-mgm-gain-creative-control-1236313930/">伴随着</a>Eon Productions达成的一项协议<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">，将对专营权的创造性控制转移到了亚马逊</a>：</p><blockquote><p> “我的生活一直致力于维护和建立我们父亲Cubby Broccoli交给我迈克尔和我的非凡遗产。我很荣幸与四位才华横溢的演员紧密合作，这些演员曾在该行业中饰演007和成千上万的出色艺术家。在“没有时间死”的结论和迈克尔从电影中退休，我觉得是时候专注于我的其他项目了。”</p></blockquote><p>西兰花的兄弟迈克尔·威尔逊（Michael Wilson）在他的陈述中稍微宽广，说：“因此，芭芭拉（Barbara）和我同意，是时候让我们值得信赖的合作伙伴亚马逊米高梅工作室（Amazon MGM Studios）带领詹姆斯·邦德（James Bond）进入未来”在她的说法中说，对亚马逊的一句话并不是一句话，威尔逊的称赞只是孤独的形容词所<em>信任的</em>。但是，威尔逊（Wilson）尝试略有宽容的谎言是，Eon Productions和Amazon<em>从来都不是</em>伴侣。在亚马逊收购之前，这是旧的米高梅工作室，这是Eon的合作伙伴（ <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/646-dr-no">1963年的<em>Dr. No</em></a> ）。</p><p>我的意思是要在WSJ故事破裂时发布一个链接，并且错误地认为我有，但是它在假期周围的裂缝中滑落了。但是从那以后，我对专营权的未来有一种不好的感觉。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“亚马逊上亚马逊上的芭芭拉·西兰花”，私人：“这些人在他妈的白痴”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/broccoli-amazon-idiots">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>惠普打印机部门的第一个人类后收购产品的泄漏图像</title><link href="https://x.com/VCBrags/status/1892332805570314491" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/hp-humane" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41593</id><published> 2025-02-20T16：57：38Z</published><updated> 2025-02-21T14：50：33Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>上周，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）取笑了</a>今天即将到来的“家庭中最新成员”产品公告。事实证明，这是<a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> ，该设备的名字简短地使我犹豫不决地瘫痪了有关如何资本化的设备， <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-19">1</a></sup>取代了阵容中的三岁iPhone SE（第三代）。</p><h2>公告</h2><p>苹果在当前在其主页上的13分钟视频中宣布了这一消息，但似乎<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">只能在YouTube上挂钩</a>。 （也许是<a href="https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-16e/2025/d9015f23-5cc1-45b4-b25a-2b1caee9d7ac/films/announcement/iphone-16e-announcement-tpl-us-2025_16x9.m3u8">吗</a>？）当然，这也是在<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">Apple新闻编辑室的新闻稿</a>中宣布的。视频的前三分钟以蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）为特色（谈论iPhone的伟大，尤其是iPhone 16，以及苹果智能）。在接下来的五分钟内，将事情交给iPhone产品营销副总裁Kaiann Drance； Drance主要回顾了iOS 18的Tentpole功能，尤其是Apple Intelligence。 Drance将iPhone产品设计主管的主管露西·布朗宁（Lucy Browning）提出了主题演讲，他谈到了16E的细节。关于视频的最不寻常的事情是它的设置：不是苹果公园，而不是史蒂夫·乔布斯剧院，而是<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I&amp;t=2727s">无限的白色空白</a>，在过去的时代，诸如著名的霍奇曼 /长期的苹果电视广告中，“我是Mac /我是Mac /我是PC”系列。 （新的无限空隙可以说是浅灰色，而不是白色。）</p><h2>名字</h2><p>首先，名称。这不是第四代iPhone SE，而是完全具有新的“ E”后缀。苹果公司使用了iPhone 4s，5s，6s和Xs的“ S”后缀；带有iPhone 5C的“ C”和XR的“ R”。我们将看看此“ E”是否是一次性。在今天的在线新闻发布会上，当被问及E是否代表任何东西时，Apple代表说不，它不属于任何东西，而是为每个人建造的。我认为她并不是要暗示E秘密代表<em>所有人</em>，只是因为我很确定苹果不希望每个人都购买最低价格的iPhone型号。苹果也从来没有对“ SE”名称的解释，尽管在我的脑海中，我已经读过这是有点代表<em>特别版</em>的代表？早在过去，我认为菲尔·席勒（Phil Schiller）曾经在“ iPhone 3gs”中说过“ S”，因为3GS实际上比前一年的3G速度要<em>快得多</em>，而“ iPhone 5C”中的“ C”肯定要快。 ，如果非正式，则代表<em>颜色</em>。但是，除了苹果认为“ iPhone 16e”的外观和听起来很酷，最好不要浪费太多时间试图为此找到任何逻辑。我很高兴这不是“ iPhone 16 AI”。</p><p>将“ 16”一代用作名称的一部分，比新E后缀更有趣。这也许表明E Edition手机可能会成为一年一度的。我不会打赌。但是SE模型于2016年3月，2020年4月和2022年3月发布，因此差距是不规则的。至少，16e名称将在未来几年，这款iPhone的基本规格以及大致何时亮相时，将有助于清楚地表明它。每次我在过去的一两年中引用第三代SE时，我都必须在它首次亮相时准确查找以及它所使用的A系列芯片（A15，与iPhone 13相同）。</p><h2>定价</h2><p>正如预期的那样，现有的第三代iPhone SE现在不在阵容中。第三代SE于2022年3月首次亮相，起价为$ 430（对64 GB的微不足道），分别为128和256 GB配置，分别为480美元和580美元。新的iPhone 16e起价为600美元，取决于您的外观，要么提高了170美元（以最便宜的新iPhone Apple出售的价格）或增加了120美元（价格最便宜的128 GB iPhone Apple的价格）。我已经看到人们的gobs认为iPhone 16e的“应该”起价仅为500美元，但是如果您查看苹果的整个iPhone 16阵容的定价，则在16e和16e之间存在200美元的差距，相同的存储层常规16，以及常规16和16 Pro之间。因此，我认为600美元是“正确”的价格。还值得指出的是，根据<a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">美国劳工统计局的通货膨胀计算器</a>，2022年1月的500美元约为2025年1月的565美元。</p><p>这是一张桌子，上面有苹果当前出售的新iPhone。我包括现在已掩盖的iPhone SE供参考。还要注意，尽管这些是苹果本身向消费者出售的唯一模型，但其他旧型号仍由世界各地的各种运营商和零售合作伙伴（包括iPhone SE）出售。 </p><table class="table-5EE26071-E20E-463E-860C-F4FEB8AD1841" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

    alt="Apple比较iPhone 16 Pro，16和16e之间的电池寿命规格的屏幕截图。"
    width = 525
  /></a></p><p> 16e实现电池寿命如何超过更昂贵的iPhone 16，并且与更昂贵的iPhone 16 Pro有效地相同？我怀疑它是更大的电池和更有效的蜂窝调制解调器的组合。如谣言所说，16E是苹果公司的第一台带有内部设计的调制解调器的iPhone，在视频中，Kaiann Drance在视频中介绍了（重点添加）：“并且使用iPhone 16e，我们将通过C1扩大Apple Silicon的好处。 ，第一个苹果设计的蜂窝调制解调器。它提供了快速可靠的5G连接性，并且<em>是iPhone中有史以来最强大的调制解调器</em>。”就像CPU和GPU一样，Apple对定制硅的兴趣不仅是价格和性能，而且还与效率有关。 <a href="https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=199">Drance然后继续</a>（通过16e内部组件的凉爽分离动画说话），“我们将苹果硅的令人难以置信的功率效率与针对iPhone 16E的全新内部设计相结合，该设计已针对更大的电池进行了优化。一起，在6.1英寸iPhone中，它为空前的电池寿命铺平了道路。”可能还有其他更改使16E可容纳比常规16更大的电池，但是从规格表中，显而易见的是省略Magsafe。</p><h2>苹果的C1芯片</h2><p>功率效率听起来很棒，当然，调制解调器支持“ 5G”，但它不支持MMWave / Ultra Gidband，这是5G的疯狂超快速变体，具有Wi-Fi样速度<em>和</em>类似Wi-Fi的短距离来自为之服务的载体天线。在费城的家中，我在城市的某些街区看到来自Verizon的超宽带（<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118203">由状态栏中的“ 5G UW”图标表示</a>），但并非大多数。但是我真的在乎吗？老实说，与LTE相比，我根本不知道为什么我应该关心5G。使用LTE代替5G（更不用说使用5G超宽带）对我在手机上的蜂窝上所做的任何事情都没有实际的影响。显然，苹果最终希望在自己的调制解调器中支持超宽带，但是他们与高通公司的重新达成交易 -<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">仅由高通公司宣布并夸大了</a>，因为苹果鄙视他们并深深地对其对他们的依赖深表敬意 - 涵盖了“ 2024年，2025年智能手机”和2026”。因此，我认为我们不会在今年9月预期的iPhone 17或17 Pro中看到C系列芯片，但也许我们会在传闻中的iPhone 17“ Air”中看到一个。</p><p>还请记住，当我上次看到它进行测试时 -<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">妮可·恩吉恩（Nicole Nguyen）在2022年</a>- 在她的视频流程测试中禁用5G并专门使用LTE将iPhone 13 Pro的电池寿命从13到15.5小时延长。超宽带5G<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">确实是疯狂的快速</a>，常规5G通常比LTE快，但是对于大多数地方的大多数人来说，实际上并不重要，尤其是考虑到对电池寿命的影响。 “足够快，电池寿命较长”是比“比您注意到的速度要快的速度，电池寿命要快的速度”。</p><p>说到无线，我不知道它是否与C1芯片有关，但是iPhone 16e仅支持Wi-Fi 6，而不是7，并且不支持线程网络。</p><h2>后面只有一台相机，但“ 2合1”</h2><p>这里不足为奇 - 摄像机很昂贵，只有提供的摄像机才能显而易见。苹果称这款孤独的相机为“ 2合1”，因为就像其他iPhone型号上的主摄像头一样，它同时提供了1×和2×<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6110937480">光场的视野</a>（1×使用整个48MP传感器，通过产生12MP的图像将传感器像素阵列视为“ Quad Pixels；缺少第二台超宽相机不仅意味着没有0.5倍镜头，而且没有宏观摄影，也没有空间照片或视频。 16E还提供“摄影风格”，而不是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16#photography">16和16 Pro提供的</a>“最新一代摄影风格”。</p><p>如果您真的在乎<em>相机</em>，那么iPhone 16e不是您的iPhone。如上所述，它的镜头较少，成像管道不支持下一代的摄影风格（在五个月内，我继续在自己的摄影中真正享受）。但这并不意味着iPhone 16e并不是关心照片的人的有效选择。有些人确实确实在乎他们的摄影，但无论他们拥有哪种iPhone型号，都可以使用主要的1×相机进行射击。不用担心相机硬件，只有照明和框架才是许多认真的摄影师所共有的哲学。</p><h2>没有相机控制按钮</h2><p>另一个与16E相机的摄像头软件相关的叮当是，它侧面没有新的相机控制按钮/滑块。我知道几个iPhone 16所有者声称他们从不使用它，甚至不喜欢它，因为他们发现自己只偶然地援引它。我真的很喜欢它，并将其用作启动相机应用程序和捕获图像的主要方法。但是，您知道，我们所有人都捕获了17个iPhone世代的图像和视频，而没有该硬件按钮。无论您有多喜欢，您当然都不需要它。</p><p>但是，到目前为止，您<em>确实</em>需要“相机控制”按钮来调用<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-visual-intelligence-with-camera-control-iph12eb1545e/ios">Apple Intelligence的视觉智能功能</a>。摄像机控制的按下弹性启动您喜欢的相机应用；长压调用视觉智能。尽管缺少相机控制按钮，但苹果在iPhone 16E上实现视觉智能的解决方案是两倍。首先，视觉智能现在可以在控制中心提供。其次，正如Apple在公告视频中所展示的那样，您可以将动作按钮分配给视觉智能。 （默认情况下，就像其他配备了动作按钮的iPhone一样，它默认用于切换静音模式，例如yore的专用铃声开关 - 在iPhone 15上，“ yore”我的意思是。）</p><p>苹果代表今天还告诉我，iPhone 15 Pro的所有者很快将能够将其动作按钮绑定到视觉智能上，“在未来的软件更新中”。我怀疑未来的软件更新是iOS 18.4，现在每天都在Beta上启动，但是Apple不会在记录上发表或关闭记录，何时此功能将出现在iPhone 15 Pro上。他们还确认，启动视觉智能的控制中心按钮也将用于iPhone 15 Pro（大概也可能是iPhone 16型号）。 iPhone 15 Pro尽管有资格获得Apple Intelligence，但迄今为止缺乏视觉智能功能，因为视觉智能功能仅通过相机控制按钮触发。坦率地说，苹果没有通过动作按钮和控制中心为15个专业用户启用此功能有点奇怪 - 也许他们真的想等待16e公告？</p><h2>展示</h2><p>16e显示规格看起来不错，但是前传感器阵列在一个缺口后面，而不是一个充满活力的岛。对于最低价格模型来说，这是一个合理的设计权衡。 16和16个Pro显示器提供了1,000列（典型），1,600 NIT（HDR）和2,000 Nit（室外）的亮度规格。 16e显示器提供800列（典型），1,200（HDR），并且不超过此。 16和16个Pro的不喜欢也只能达到最低亮度的最低亮度。苹果没有列出16e显示器的最低亮度。</p><h2>硅</h2><p>iPhone 16e中的A18芯片似乎（在规格页面上）几乎与iPhone 16相同，除了GPU内核的数量：16E只有4个GPU内核，但常规iPhone 16具有5个。（A18（A18）。 iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max中的Pro Chip具有6个GPU核心。</p><p>与iPhone 16相比，更有趣的是，与iPhone 15相比，它的价格比16E高100美元。由于进入iPhone 15 Pro型号的A17 Pro是唯一的A17代芯片，因此常规iPhone 15具有iPhone 14型号的A16芯片。除了与两年历史的A16相比，A18的所有一般性能改进外，功能最大的差异是iPhone 16E支持Apple Intelligence，而iPhone 15则没有。由于去年6月在WWDC宣布了Apple Intelligence时广泛涵盖的范围，这主要是RAM的功能，但是无论出于何种原因，价格便宜的iPhone 16e都具有Apple Intelligence，而iPhone 15则没有。也许这不是一个<em>大的</em>喧嚣，但这绝对是某种喧嚣。</p><p>也许，像三代SE型号一样，iPhone 16E的设计旨在在这个价格点保持几年。如果确实如此，它的成本比“一年历史的常规iPhone”低100美元的事实将于9月更有意义，当时700美元的型号是iPhone 16。用多种方式打电话，比iPhone 15打电话。它具有更快的芯片，可支持苹果智能，并且电池寿命更长。 iPhone 15确实具有0.5倍的超宽相机，并且显示屏稍好一些（其中包括更好的动态岛而不是档位）。当然，iPhone 15具有粉红色，黄色，绿色和蓝色等颜色。但是，如果您像大多数人一样，一直在一个情况下保留手机，那么您可能不太在乎手机的颜色。可以说，iPhone 16e的手机比iPhone 15更好，而且我认为它的价值几乎是一个更好的价值，价格少100美元。</p><h2>颜色</h2><p>只要黑色或白色，您就可以获得想要的16e颜色。第三代iPhone SE在午夜，星光和红色产品。 （Apple现在已经完成了产品红色的合作？我认为<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-marks-world-aids-day-with-red/">Apple Watch Series 9是最后一款用RED提供的设备</a>。）</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-19"><p>有一段时间的iPhone 4s，苹果的营销材料使用了小型“ S”，而苹果打算“ S”是上层或小写的，这是有些歧义像小写的“ S”。他们定居在4s上。但是，当发布iPhone 5s和5c时，Apple不仅为这两个后缀小写设计了样式，而且还将“ 4S”中的“ S”重新形成了较低的小写。我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">在2013年的iPhone 5s和5C评论的脚注中</a>详细介绍了这一点，其中我解释了我决定对它们进行提示。但是我有点像“ 16e”的外观。是...友好吗？小写的“ e”具有正确的含义，即这是常规iPhone 16的较小兄弟姐妹，而不是某种升级或优越。因此，就目前而言，我要进行流程并保持“ E”小写。我对如何处理这一问题的一位朋友对此表示震惊，无礼地建议我选择<em>iPhone16ᵉ</em> 。 <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★关于当今iPhone 16e公告的想法和观察</title></entry><entry><title>&#39;哦，人性化&#39; </title><link href="https://spyglass.org/humane-ai-pin-strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/oh-the-humane-ity" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41590</id><published> 2025-02-19T16：48：23Z</published><updated> 2025-02-19T16：48：24Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>我敢肯定，您在上周看到了这一消息，这两个主要的地图应用程序提供商Google和Apple都<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">将其地图更新，以称墨西哥湾为“美国湾”</a> 。 Microsoft的Bing Maps（我将作为次要的提供商）也进行了更改。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-17">1</a></sup>实际上，这比“他们更名为墨西哥湾”要复杂得多，但暂时忍受了。</p><p>我同样肯定，您也看到了很多人对Google和Apple生气。这种愤怒在某种程度上是放错的。我明白了愤怒的来源，但仍然放错了地方。我最初的看法是在1月20日特朗普的就职演讲中，如果他经历了苹果和Google，以及发布地图的其他所有人都应该忽略它。显然，特朗普确实经历了：美国地质调查局是内政部内部的机构，该机构在行政部门内，因此在总统的职权范围内，<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/gulf-america">正式进行了2月7日的更改</a>。现在，这是美国政府的官方政策，“只是忽略它”确实是不可行的。如果这仍然是您的立场，我恳请您至少考虑更多的细微差别。</p><p>但是，首先，让我们提前规定，在特朗普2.0政府短短四个星期内，美国和世界面临着多个更重要和紧迫的问题。在我的头顶上：乌克兰，加沙，关税，门槛， <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/nyregion/scotten-letter.html?unlocked_article_code=1.w04.Lkj2.Tu4sBTtDGwqQ&amp;smid=url-share">法治</a>。无论您是批准还是不赞成特朗普对任何或所有问题的行动，都应该毫无疑问地认为，所有这些都很重要和结果。我们在地图上看到的名字，供水体，不多。但这是首先是重命名的小小的，相对不重要的，是重命名的令人不安的宠爱，这是一个事实，即在特朗普的执行行动之前，没有争议，<em>零</em>，<em>无，NADA</em> ， <em>NADA</em>在世界任何地方，在任何一组中，人们关于墨西哥湾的名字 - 这使得详细研究Google和Apple如何选择处理它变得有趣。这仅仅是因为这个特定的问题是如此的壮观，我们可以全面考虑。</p><p>名称更改背后的动机也很简单。特朗普没有改变美国正式认可的大西洋或非洲大陆的名称。他也很容易，但他不会。直到他从稀薄的空气中引起争议之前，这并不像“墨西哥湾”在“有争议或有争议的名字”的列表中。这只是全球一个名字，美国总统可以改变将其坚持到墨西哥，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/judge-curiel-trump-border-wall/index.html">对种族主义的情感</a>。特朗普从未在我们与加拿大<em>北部</em>边界建造墙壁上竞选，他（还没有？）试图重命名安大略湖。这是关于墨西哥的，并通过菲亚特主张权力。特朗普拥有<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trump-in-name-only-how-investors-lost-millions-buying-into-t">将自己的名字命名在他不拥有的建筑物上的</a>历史。他宁愿将自己的名字刻在自己没有拥有的建筑物上的建筑物上，而不是拥有他的名字。对于特朗普来说，标志上的名字比契据更重要。现在，在地图上的名称也是如此。墨西哥湾是一个国际水域，不属于国家，但宣布这个新名字意味着它迄今属于墨西哥，现在属于我们，即我们属于他，我们毫无疑问的亲爱的领导人。特朗普从墨西哥带走了它，而没有开枪 - 实际上他所做的只是在政府数据库中更改一根绳子。莎士比亚会让我们相信，从任何其他名字中，海洋都会味道咸。特朗普不读莎士比亚。</p><h2> Google和Apple如何标记全球海湾</h2><p>要知道的第一个重要的事情是Google地图和Apple Maps不是奇异的全球地图集。他们都在世界各地的不同地区显示不同的名称（在极少数情况下，不同的地理位置）。它们每个都更像是区域地图集的集合。在约束中，只有一个<a href="https://www.oed.com/">牛津英语词典</a>。如果OED更改了单词的定义或添加了一个新单词，那么这些更改将显示给世界上每个人。我的OED是您的OED，无论您和我目前在哪里生活或发现自己在全球范围内。 Google和Apple地图不是那样的。最好将它们视为提供区域地图的服务。</p><p>值得赞扬的是，Google有一篇博客文章<a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">，描述和说明了世界各地的用户现在在Google Maps中看到的内容</a>：</p><blockquote><p>在美国，<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">地理名称信息系统</a>（GNIS）已正式将“墨西哥湾”<a href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730">更新</a>为“美国湾”。正如我们在两周前<a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951">宣布的</a>那样，并与我们的长期实践一致，我们开始进行更改以反映此更新。在美国使用地图的人们将看到“美国海湾”，墨西哥的人们将看到“墨西哥湾”。其他所有人都会看到两个名字。</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/google-maps-gulf.png">正如他们的插图显示的那样</a>，“两个名字”是指在美国或墨西哥以外的其他任何地方的用户中将“美国湾”放在括号中：“墨西哥湾（美国海湾）”。</p><p>苹果的方法更像是苹果，也要没有发表评论。在更改Apple Map的名称之前，他们没有发表公开评论，此后他们没有公开评论。 （我已经要求Apple PR发表评论，但一无所获。）我很高兴像Google一样发表声明，说明世界各地的用户应该期望看到什么。但是我也理解他们渴望尽可能少的话。从某种意义上说，苹果地图上的标签不言而喻，这是唯一重要的事情。我也感谢，通过永远不要宣布有关此事的政策，苹果可以在不撤销或修改政策的情况下更改其地图标签。</p><p>因此，没有苹果的声明描述了如何在世界范围内标记海湾，我尽我所能：<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114003192100392251">我在美国以外的Mastodon上询问了我的追随者，他们在美国以外的地方，他们将其视为海湾的名字</a>，并在可能的情况下包括屏幕截图。那是在2月14日星期五的2月14日，苹果地图开始向美国的用户展示“美国湾”代替“墨西哥湾”的“墨西哥湾”。反应是压倒性的，来自世界各地二十多个国家的人们的答复。 <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-17">2</a></sup>当时，他们的答复表明，苹果与Google采取了一种微妙但有趣的方法。机智，虽然美国每个人都看到“美国湾”（没有提及既定名称），但世界上其他所有人仍然看到“墨西哥湾”（或他们的语言对该名称的翻译），但没有提及在括号或其他情况下，美国现在认可的新名称。</p><p>我希望那是苹果的计划，在将美国隔离为世界上唯一一个名字“美国湾”这个名字时，它会悄悄地颠覆。但是我担心苹果只是比Google慢的，它首先是为美国用户应用的，但是世界其他地区的变化根本没有传播。我的恐惧是有必要的。</p><p>傍晚（美国东部时间）2月15日（美国东部时间），对我对Mastodon的恳求的新回应开始在与Google的苹果地图上展示标签：</p><ul><li>在美国：“美国湾”。</li><li>在墨西哥：“墨西哥湾”。</li><li>其他地方：“墨西哥湾（美国海湾）”。</li></ul><p>我相信，您看到的标签的决定因素，至少在Apple地图上，与您的物理位置无关，如GPS或IP地址所确定的，而仅仅是OS的区域设置。在MacOS和iOS上，这是在设置→常规→语言和区域→区域中。这很有意义 - 您可以使用Apple Map（和Google Maps）使用位置服务关闭。您可以在设备上使用此设置，以查看世界各地的用户在地图中看到什么而无需离开家，而无需更改设备的语言。因此，如果您是一个设备设置为“美国”地区的美国人，如果您在美国外面旅行而不更改设备设置，您仍然会看到墨西哥湾的特定新名称：美国”，以其历史悠久的世界认可的名字 - 我敢说，它的明确<em>正确的</em>名字 - 甚至在括号中都没有引用。</p><h2>依赖成人内衣的一年</h2><p>不用说，这件事很糟糕。这是非常愚蠢的，而不是愚蠢的方面是jingoistic的。但是，Google或Apple可能会合理地忽略这一点的观念，并告诉特朗普（以及整个共和党及其支持者）跌倒沙子。我并不是说他们<em>做不到</em>。当然<em>可以</em>。这就像说特朗普<em>不能</em>仅仅宣布以迄今为止无争议的400年历史的国际水域的新名字。</p><p>但这是不合理的。 Google和Apple地图可以延期或至少确认其可用区域的正式认可名称是合理的。确定和裁定地图上的官方名称不是Google或Apple的位置；他们的工作是识别并显示这些名称。从理论上讲，Google和/或Apple<em>可以将</em>自己定位为地理名称的全球权威参考。要映射类似于OED或Merriam-Webster的东西，以映射到英语。但是，如果他们追求那条路线，他们就会将自己置于裁决任何和所有争议和边界的争议和争议。公民政府是我们应该<em>希望进行</em>此类争议仲裁的地方，即使没有解决。不是由私人公司。如果苹果地图在中国可用，那么苹果地图就需要呈现姓名和边界（ <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">甚至是土地群体的规模</a>，在下面更多），这是中国政府可容纳的。中国之所以坚持下去，是因为他们的要求与世界其他地区认可的名称和边界形成鲜明对比。中国地图由CCP规定的教条支配。大多数地图受地理和地缘政治现实的约束。例如，台湾实际上是一个独立的国家。中国地图（包括苹果公司为中国大陆用户服务的地图）将台湾标记为中国省。</p><p>现在，美国受到另一种教条驱动政权的约束。</p><p>从理论上讲，地图不应该是政治性的。在实践中，它们一直是并且一直都是。从理论上讲，在制图方面，合理的决策和客观上正确的决策是相同的。在实践中，政治跨越了，它们冲突。您可以争辩（许多人），Google和Apple应该坚持这位400岁，公认的世界，迄今为止毫无争议的名称“墨西哥的墨西哥湾”，并在全球范围内应用。简单地忽略了美国政府的新官方认可的官方名称。他们<em>可以</em>做到这一点。如果他们这样做的话，没有人会去监狱。不会有罚款。但是要付出代价。毫无疑问，忽略了美国政府认可的新“美国湾”名称。共和党人开始抱怨<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dan-crenshaw-complains-to-tim-cook-that-apple-maps-hasn-t-changed-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america/ar-AA1xIK2t">说，苹果地图三周前没有采用新名称</a>，甚至在政府的GNIS参考数据库中进行了正式变更之前。</p><p>忽略政治现实是法庭争议。这不符合大型跨国公司的利益。但是不可能<em>避免</em>争议。合理的是最大程度地减少争议。迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）在1990年北卡罗来纳州参议院种族中毫不掩饰<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/08/29/jesse-helms-white-racist/42090cb6-2e9b-4b13-a820-2a9b74c88fbe/">地向种族主义的</a>共和党人杰西·赫尔姆斯（Jesse Helms）公开认可民主党挑战者时，有一句著名的名言：“ <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29130478/michael-jordan-stands-firm-republicans-buy-sneakers-too-quote-says-was-made-jest">共和党人也买了运动鞋。</a>透明</p><p>有人可能会说：“这是资本主义的问题。”我认为这是资本主义的<em>好处</em>之一。除非您认为极端两极分化是为社会服务的，否则您希望看到非政治性的主要机构。营利性公司自然要担任该角色。是的，有利润动机。共和党人不仅要购买运动鞋，还购买手机并进行网络搜索。但是，谁愿意看到一个在政治上两极分化的世界，每个零售商，每个设备制造商，每个在线服务提供商，每家餐厅，您所做的，购买或访问的每一件事都可以通过两极分化的政治棱镜来观看？这样就在疯狂。</p><p>大多数美国人以及西方世界上的大多数人都对我们目前的社会两极分化的水平筋疲力尽。进一步的紧张局势不仅与苹果和Google的底线利益相反，而且这不仅仅是我们的利益。人们只想要良好的准确地图。他们不想在右倾地图和左倾地图之间选择 - 或更糟糕的是被迫被迫选择。</p><p>因此，如果您的论点是，Apple和Google都不应该向任何人（任何地方）展示“美国湾”这个名字，那么我和您在一起，那是正确的制图姿态。但这将构成政治上的渎职行为。地图是两家公司的重要服务，但是其地图的编辑完整性与其主要业务或目的并不接近。地图不是Google或Apple的英语对OED或Merriam-webster的内容。 （或者说是美联社的消息。</p><p>因此，Google和Apple是否应该显示新名称，不应该是我们要问的问题。正确的问题必然会更加细微：谁应该看到哪个名字，哪里？ Google和Apple对<em>这个</em>问题的回答是，可惜，令人失望和令人担忧。我将重复看似相同的政策，这两家公司今天<em>实际上</em>按地区呈现：</p><ul><li>美国：“美国湾”。</li><li>墨西哥：“墨西哥湾”。</li><li>世界其他任何地方：“墨西哥湾（美国湾）”。</li></ul><p>他们可以选择的最好的政治现实选择是（我会用斜体来强调这些是我自己的建议）：</p><ul><li><em>美国：“美国湾（墨西哥湾）”</em> 。</li><li><em>世界其他任何地方：“墨西哥湾”</em> 。</li></ul><p>甚至没有充分的理由在美国以外的括号中展示“美国湾”。我们是书籍上有愚蠢名称的人，所以我们应该被愚蠢的名字陷入困境。没有其他人应该遭受我们政治愚蠢的后果。但是，向我们展示新愚蠢的“美国湾”名称<em>是</em>正确的。同样，如果取决于我，美国用户将看到“美国海湾（墨西哥湾）”，其他所有人都会看到“墨西哥湾”。但这肯定是我们基于现实的社区所希望的最好的。</p><p>荒谬的是，美国这里的用户根本不再看到“墨西哥湾”。您可以搜索该术语，“美国海湾”将是第一个结果，但是拥有400年历史的“墨西哥湾”的名称不再是向US-Region用户使用Google Maps的地图上的标签。或苹果地图。在任何甚至模糊的合理的政治气候下，即使是那些赞成更改名称的人，也可能会坚持，甚至可能坚持，这是一个过渡时期，以前的熟悉的名字出现在括号中。坚持在快照中更改该名称，而没有括号对先前的名字（同样，该名称已在全球范围内已被识别了400多年，并且在存在的每一个印刷地图上都保留了，并且<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-old-man-and-the-sea-the-hemingway-library-edition-ernest-hemingway/15532053?ean=9781476787848&amp;next=t&amp;next=t">文学</a>的每项作品历史引用了海湾）具有一些真正的奥威尔式<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">记忆孔</a>的氛围。我们一直与东亚战争。一直是美国的湾。</p><p>美国的政治权利经常利用“<a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/snowflake/">雪花</a>”一词来暗示左边的人微妙而脆弱。但是，反对“墨西哥湾（墨西哥湾）”作为地图标签似乎肯定是雪花。棍子和石头可能会折断他们的骨头，但是历史上准确的括号地图标签会伤害他们吗？当您享受<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/congress-french-freedom-fries-iraq/">自由薯条</a>时，要思考的食物。</p><p>考虑一个简单的前提，即对不遵循当前事件的人来说应该有意义。这应该是毫无争议的。但是对于过去两个月中没有新闻的人来说，这种变化似乎令人困惑。更糟糕的是，这是一种误导。大多数人甚至没有理由怀疑Google Map和Apple地图都显示出特定于区域的名称和标签。总的来说，美国人倾向于是狭och的。向美国人展示“美国湾”的名字，没有“（墨西哥湾）”强烈暗示这是现在的新世界认可的名字，而事实上的事实完全恰恰相反：这是一个被一个人认可的名称一个国家。 <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-17">3</a></sup></p><p>根本没有向美国人展示新名称将对特朗普政府及其支持者挑衅。但是向世界上每个地区展示新名称，但墨西哥本身对特朗普及其支持者来说是不必要的。使墨西哥成为全球命名政策的例外不是对他们的荣誉或恩宠，而是隐含的侮辱。它暗示他们也有一些问题，这使我们在美国特朗普主义者之外的权利之外的观念合法化，关于海湾的名字有合法的辩论。隐含的信息是：“<em>您走了，您精致的白痴，我们将使您成为世界上仅有的两个国家中的第二个国家，涉及这种水体的名称 - 您和美国。</em>墨西哥既不要求也没有引起任何这种情况。 （墨西哥在1821年才从西班牙实现独立；“墨西哥湾”的名称是墨西哥的两倍，是一个国家，至少是美国大150岁。）</p><p>在许多国家 /地区，Google Maps和Apple Maps显示了特定区域的名称以及有争议的边界（ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/9wq9vf/why_is_there_no_border_on_google_maps_between/">或缺乏</a>）。从<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/">2020年《华盛顿邮报》的一份报告中</a>：</p><blockquote><p>撒哈拉西部标志着与摩洛哥北部边界的线路消失了，因为摩洛哥人在网络上寻求它，以及该地区的名字。人口稀少的西北非洲地区在1975年占领的摩洛哥和萨拉维土著之间存在争议。</p><p>有时，面对国际共识。土耳其内部的Google Maps用户可以找到北塞浦路斯的土耳其共和国，即在地中海岛国家北部三分之一的TRNC。该领土并未得到联合国的认可，也没有Google的映射竞争对手。</p></blockquote><p>世界各地还有其他地方，苹果和Google在地图上表现出彻头彻尾的疯狂或不正确的东西。后者有一个共同点：他们要遵守由薄皮的专制男子所统治的国家的要求，这些国家与愚蠢的人在一起。如上所述，在中国，台湾<a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/fact-check-apple-maps-taiwan-03072024174451.html">被错误地标记为苹果地图中的中国省</a>。 <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-17">4</a></sup> （Google地图，就像Google Services一样，在中国都不可用。）2021年，韦恩·马萨<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">（</a> Wayne MA）报道：2021年，韦恩·马萨（Wayne MA）报告说：</p><blockquote><p>在2014年或2015年初的某个时候，中国州调查和地图局告诉苹果地图团队成员建造透明岛群岛（中国和日本之间长期进行领土争端的对象。根据内部文件，中国监管机构还威胁要拒绝预定第一届Apple Watch（计划于2015年发布），如果苹果不遵守异常请求，则应予以批准。</p><p>该团队的一些成员最初在加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺的苹果总部回到了需求。但是地图应用程序已成为苹果公司的优先事项，因此最终该公司遵守了。当中国大陆的苹果地图中观看时，杜尤亚群岛（Diaoyu Islands）的出现比周围地区更大。</p></blockquote><p>您将站在坚定的地面上，批评苹果对中国对此的要求。但是根本问题显然不是苹果。这是中国受共产主义专制主义者的统治，专制主义扭曲了思想，包括专制领导人本身的思想。你知道没人怎么说吗？ “<em>中国的领导完全理智和明智，他们的命令是基于现实而不是教条。</em>透明</p><p>如果您看不到特朗普对墨西哥湾的重命名是同样的坚果，那么至少在此问题上，您的思想已经扭曲了。 We can argue how far along that spectrum this “Gulf of America” thing is, but the only reasonable debate is of matters of degree. Apple and Google&#39;s decision to show this made-up name in parentheses to everyone around the world is akin to showing China&#39;s fictionally inflated size of the Diaoyu Islands to everyone in the world, as, say, a dotted outline surrounding the geographically accurate representations of the actual islands&#39; sizes. There&#39;s a word for this stuff, and that word is <em>propaganda</em> .</p><p> Imagine if the government of France decreed that the English Channel was now the “French Channel”. Now imagine that Google and Apple Maps complied, even just to the degree of changing the label, <em>outside</em> France (which, per their company policies, should see “French Channel”) and the United Kingdom (which would still see only “English Channel”) to show the rest of the world, including us in the United States, “English Channel (French Channel)”. It would rightfully be considered insulting nonsense.</p><p> The only difference from my hypothetical and our reality with the Gulf of Mexico is that France, in addition to not having a narcissistic would-be autocrat as its president ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-gets-new-government-after-weeks-uncertainty-2024-09-21/">yet</a> ?), is not the world&#39;s lone remaining superpower. That&#39;s what makes Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s acquiescence worrisome, not merely irritating. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamellebouie.net/post/3lia22gxsgk24">pithily observed over the weekend</a> , on Bluesky, “My take is that your willingness to accept this Gulf of America nonsense is an indicator of your willingness to accept much worse things coming from this administration.”</p><p> The calculus Google and Apple should naturally be striving to achieve is finding the correct balance between two axes. One axis is integrity: both the cartographic integrity of the labels on the companies&#39; maps, and the institutional integrity — <em>dignity</em> even — of the companies themselves. Billions of people around the world trust Google and Apple. Their decisions on this mapping matter — no matter how trivial in the grand scheme of things — should strengthen, not erode, that trust.</p><p> The other axis is the minimization of controversy.</p><p> Simply maximizing integrity — by ignoring the “Gulf of America” name completely — would incur volcanic controversy within the United States. This calculated balance is behind my suggestion of showing “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” within the United States, and showing just “Gulf of Mexico” everywhere else. Perhaps the inclusion of the longstanding name within parentheses is too much for freedom-fry-eating Republicans. But showing the new “Gulf of America” name in parentheses to everyone around the world is itself incurring controversy, and, more tellingly, is a strike against the integrity of both the companies and their maps.</p><p> Obsequiousness is inherently undignified. Google and Apple are proud companies. But both have chosen a gratuitously undignified presentation of this new American-dictated name to the entire world. Their mutual decision here ultimately seems driven not by integrity (to be sure), nor the minimization of controversy, but instead by a third, unnatural factor: fear.</p><p> Neither company will comment on it but surely this issue — inconsequential in the grand scheme of things though it may be — rose to the highest ranks of leadership. I&#39;ll eat my hat if Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook didn&#39;t both sign off on, if not actively participate in the decision-making process, how to represent the Gulf of Mexico&#39;s name. Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. But so eager are Pichai and Cook to avoid the wrath and vindictiveness of Trump that they&#39;re willing to peddle his foolish “Gulf of America” name to everyone in the world who doesn&#39;t live in Mexico. Wrapping it in parentheses is like wrapping a dead fish in newspaper — it doesn&#39;t contain the stench.</p><p> Of course “The Gulf of America” name is stupid. Trump is stupid. Not stupid meaning dim or dull — would that he were, but he remains sharp, cunning, and highly agitated — but stupid because he&#39;s nuts, warped by a narcissistic disorder of Napoleonic dimensions. The new name is as stupid as his MAGA hats are ugly. He might as well have sold<a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Subsidized_Time">the naming rights</a> to Musk and Tesla. There is something really wrong with him, and this “Gulf of America” name change exemplifies at least one aspect of his narcissistic insanity.每个人都知道。 Even his supporters know it. They just tell themselves it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s how tribalism morphs into cultism.</p><p> The false note in Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s parable “The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes” is that once the emperor is called out, for in fact strutting around stark naked while ostensibly wearing a suit of clothes so fine that they&#39;ve visible only to the eyes of smart and discerning people, is that <em>all</em> the townsfolk laugh at him. That wouldn&#39;t happen. Many would laugh. Most, one hopes. But the emperor&#39;s die-hard supporters would react with anger at the outburst of mockery, not join in the laughter. He looks great, they&#39;d insist, not like the jackass their own lying eyes tell them he is.</p><p> There is something wrong with Trump — and there is something lesser, but worrisomely wrong with those defending him.</p><p> Apple Maps and Google Maps do not consider themselves cartographic editorial authorities. They choose not to show one universal set of mapping (and naming) data to the world.他们可以。但是他们没有。 Actual editorial authorities, on the other hand, are under no obligation to follow the US GNIS&#39;s official decisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Wikipedia correctly still calls it The Gulf of Mexico</a> . The Associated Press, whose stylebook is followed by many publications, small and large, <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/">issued the following guidance after Trump&#39;s executive order last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The body of water has shared borders between the US and Mexico. Trump&#39;s order only carries authority within the United States. Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.作为一家全球传播全球新闻的全球新闻社，美联社必须确保所有受众都可以识别地位名称和地理。</p></blockquote><p> The Trump administration — petty, stupid, vindictive, and most of all, <em>insecure</em> fools that they are — has lashed out, and is now in the midst of a weeklong standoff <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/white-house-continues-its-absurd-ban-against-the-associated-press/">during which they&#39;ve prevented AP journalists from attending official events</a> , entirely and solely because of the AP&#39;s perfectly reasonable style guidance on the Gulf&#39;s name. If Trump and his 2.0 administration had any modicum of confidence that this name change is correct and justified, they&#39;d roll their eyes, not lash out, at the Associated Press for continuing to stipulate otherwise. What kind of government does stuff like that? Everyone knows the answer: tin-pot dictator autocracies. (And <em>would-be</em> autocracies, we can hope.) <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-17">5</a></sup> This whole “Gulf of America” thing is, if you take a step back, objectively hilarious. Like Pinocchio turning into a real boy, Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico is like a late night comedy joke turned real. It&#39;s beyond parody. If this had been on SNL during the 2024 campaign, you&#39;d have laughed. And you should laugh now. Mockery is a powerfully subversive weapon against authority — even more effective, I&#39;d argue, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists">than a guitar</a> .</p><p> But it&#39;s worth directing our laughter at Google and Apple as well. They&#39;re squandering their own hard-earned reputations for integrity to suggest there&#39;s even a parenthetical alternative-name level of international legitimacy — not merely one man&#39;s vanity — behind this.没有。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-17"><p> <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> , god bless them, are still labelling it “Gulf of Mexico”.

<p>Extraordinary illustrated essay by Marcin Wichary, documenting a typeface — and its long, fascinating, splintered history — that exemplifies the difference between <em>beautiful</em> and <em>pretty</em> . The beauty in Gorton isn&#39;t just in its plainness and hardworking mechanical roots — it&#39;s in the history of the 20th century itself.

<p>New research published from Apple machine learning researchers Yuhan Hu, Peide Huang, Mouli Sivapurapu, Jian Zhang:</p><blockquote><p> Nonverbal behaviors such as posture, gestures, and gaze are essential for conveying internal states, both consciously and unconsciously, in human interaction. For robots to interact more naturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities — such as intention, attention, and emotions — alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment, spatial constraints, and time efficiency. In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a lamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and expressive objectives in movement design.</p></blockquote><p> I enjoyed seeing something Luxo-esque made real, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12493">the paper itself</a> is fairly readable — and worth skimming at least for the illustrations. But I&#39;ll wait for an actual product to get excited. Unlike <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">marketing concept videos</a> , I don&#39;t think publishing academic research is harmful to a company — and in fact, as has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/26/apple-ai-research-paper">much</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/07/19/apple-machine-learning-journal">discussed</a> regarding Apple&#39;s institutional penchant for secrecy, it&#39;s seemingly essential for Apple to not only permit but encourage this, to recruit top-tier talent in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. But publishing academic research is closer to publishing marketing concept videos than it is to releasing an actual product.

<p>Joe Rosensteel:</p><blockquote><p> Netflix deeply regrets accidentally making Netflix a better product for its customers. It temporarily pushed out a change that let people <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/have-apple-and-netflix-finally-made-an-apple-tv-deal/">see Netflix shows in the Apple TV app</a> , a change people have been asking for since the debut of the Apple TV app in 2016 with its Up Next queue and content aggregation features. Fortunately, Netflix swiftly corrected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">the error</a> before too many of its users could experience anything approaching joy, or satisfaction with Netflix. Customers should definitely drop the issue and not press Netflix to turn the feature that certainly exists back on.</p></blockquote><p> I see why Netflix is sticking to its guns on this one, but they&#39;re on the wrong side. Apple TV users were overjoyed yesterday when the Netflix app briefly started integrating with the TV app for “what next”, etc. Steven Aquino described it as “ <a href="https://www.curbcuts.co/blog/apple-and-netflix-must-do-right-and-finally-make-tv-app-peace-for-accessibilitys-sake">jubilance</a> ”.</p><p> Only a small subset — perhaps, by Netflix&#39;s grand global scale, downright minuscule — of Netflix users use Apple TV hardware. But those of us who do, do so because we love it. Most people think “Why pay extra for yet another box to connect, yet another remote control, yet another thing to learn, when Netflix and most other popular streaming services are just built right into my TV?” Apple TV users go the extra mile to buy the extra box — which isn&#39;t cheap — because they have good taste and want an experience that is superior in all regards: technically, UI-wise, and privacy-wise.</p><p> So it&#39;s not just a random small subset of its users that Netflix is disappointing by refusing to adopt the idiomatic conventions of good tvOS citizenship, it&#39;s the subset of users who care the most, for good reasons. It&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like making a Mac-like Mac app rather than serving Mac users warmed-over cross-platform slop. Or, as MG Siegler put it <a href="https://spyglass.org/netflix-apple-tv/#update">when he updated his post</a> after it turned out this was a rug pull, “Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck. Do these fucking idiots know how stupid this looks and <em>is</em> ?”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Netflix Deeply Regrets Accidentally Making Netflix a Better Product for Its Customers’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/netflix-apple-tv-integration-oopsie">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Financial Times: &#39;Is Corporate America Already Souring on Trump?&#39; </title><link href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7c9376b-4cb2-4cf2-a665-66f75b72f4c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w30" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/ft-corporate-america-souring" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41580</id><published> 2025-02-15T17:20:00Z</published><updated> 2025-02-15T22:22:55Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jay Peters and Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Nearly a month after it was banned in the US, TikTok has returned to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8">App Store for iPhones</a> and other Apple devices as well as the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&amp;e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign">Google Play store</a> for Android phones and tablets.</p><p> The return follows US Attorney General Pam Bondi sending a letter to Apple assuring that it won&#39;t be fined for hosting the app, according to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">which first reported that the app would return</a> .</p></blockquote><p> From Mark Gurman&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">brief report for Bloomberg</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. will restore ByteDance Ltd.&#39;s TikTok to the US App Store on Thursday, following a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m surprised but not shocked by this. But I&#39;d sure like to see what exactly that letter says. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521">PAFACA Act</a> — the law that bans TikTok in the US now that the deadline has passed for ByteDance to sell it to a US company — hasn&#39;t changed or been rescinded, and the current delay in enforcement <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">has no basis in law</a> . Neither Apple nor Google, wisely, have been talking publicly about this at all, but it seems clear that they&#39;ve been acting in concert throughout the process. It is not a coincidence that they both de-listed and now re-listed TikTok simultaneously.</p><p> Also, still no idea how this is going to end, because I really don&#39;t think the CCP is going to allow ByteDance to sell TikTok. And there are Republicans in the Senate — eg <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-ricketts-statement-on-tiktok-being-removed-from-app-stores">Tom Cotton</a> — who stand behind the sell-or-you&#39;re-banned law.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple and Google Both Return TikTok to App Stores, After Letter of ‘Assurance’ From Attorney General Pam Bondi’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/apple-google-tiktok-app-stores">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Quid Pro Cybertruck </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-tesla-musk-cybertruck.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/quid-pro-cybertruck" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41574</id><published> 2025-02-13T23:11:41Z</published><updated> 2025-02-14T16:12:02Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jack Ewing, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> The department&#39;s procurement forecast for 2025, which details purchases the agency expects to make, includes $400 million for armored Tesla vehicles. The document does not specify which Tesla model, but the electric Cybertruck, which has a body of high-strength stainless steel, would be the most suitable vehicle.</p><p> Mr. Musk spent more than $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump, who then appointed him as the leader of a cost-cutting initiative that&#39;s been called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p> The purchase of Cybertrucks, an atypical choice for government armored transport, is likely to raise conflict of interest issues, especially as Mr. Musk trumpets his own efforts to root out what he regards as unnecessary spending.</p></blockquote><p> “Likely to raise” is doing a lot of work there. There&#39;s just no way this is good clean procurement and everyone knows it. Either Musk should run his businesses and have nothing to do with the government or he should defer from accepting any and all government contracts for his businesses. Even someone trying to do this ethically couldn&#39;t manage it; it&#39;s inherently unethical. It&#39;s being reported that this deal started under the Biden administration, which is worth noting, but even if it did, clearly Musk should recuse Tesla from consideration.</p><p> One side is powerless, at the moment, to stop it, and the other side is in the midst of a full-on embrace of partisan corruption as policy. One thing that makes Trump so hard to reckon with is that his graft is right out in the open. He ran a luxury hotel with his fucking name on it two blocks from the White House during his first term, and everyone with business before his administration — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/03/05/tmobile-trump-hotel">like when T-Mobile was trying to get approval for its acquisition of Sprint</a> — knew they were expected to stay there.</p><p> Pre-Trump, it was the “catching” of concealed dealmaking and bribery that signaled corruption being rooted out. But you can&#39;t get “caught” doing something that&#39;s right out in the open. We just have to call it what it is: abject corruption.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> Jimmy Carter&#39;s 2017 op-ed: “ <a href="https://theonion.com/you-people-made-me-give-up-my-peanut-farm-before-i-got-1819585048/">You People Made Me Give Up My Peanut Farm Before I Got To Be President</a> ”.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/g-s1-48571/trump-administration-order-400-million-worth-of-armored-teslas">Bobby Allyn at NPR reports</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The State Department said Thursday it is abandoning plans of purchasing $400 million worth of armored Tesla vehicles after a public document detailing federal contracts for fiscal year 2025 gained wide attention.</p><p> That expected purchase of Teslas, which was slated for September of this year, is now on hold, according to the State Department, which now says it has no plans of fulfilling the contract.</p></blockquote><p> Well then never mind.

<p>Tim Cook, on X:</p><blockquote><p>准备与最新的家庭成员见面。</p><p> 2月19日，星期三。#AppleLaunch</p></blockquote><p> Most people are guessing, I think correctly, that this is about the iPhone SE 4. We&#39;re also right on schedule for the M4 generation of MacBook Airs, but I don&#39;t think MacBook Airs would qualify for “newest member of the family ”。 They&#39;re more like an updated version of the current member of the family. But the next-gen iPhone SE is going to be a very different iPhone SE — it will mark the end of the Home button and Touch ID. Maybe it won&#39;t even be named “SE” but given a new name?</p><p> The “#AppleLaunch” isn&#39;t merely a hashtag, but a “ <a href="https://creativemarket.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hashflags">Hashflag</a> ” — a paid promotion with X that includes a custom emoji icon. For this one, it&#39;s a shiny liquid-metal treatment of the Apple logo ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/hashflag-applelaunch.png">screenshot</a> ). I don&#39;t know what these “hashflag” promotions cost now, but when they launched a decade ago, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/twitters-branded-emojis-come-million-dollar-commitment-169327/">AdWeek reported that the price started at $1 million</a> . And you&#39;ll never guess who has interrupted his busy day running the federal government <a href="https://x.com/arjunkhemani/status/1890072629207531914">to retweet it</a> .</p><p> I don&#39;t really get Apple&#39;s angle on this return to advertising on X. Placating Trump through flattery and his <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">“inauguration fund” racket</a> , I get. He&#39;s the president of the United States now and he&#39;s nakedly corrupt and such a profound narcissist that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/foreign-leaders-flattery-trump.html">simple abject obsequious flattery</a> works on him. But why appease Musk too? Because Musk has Trump&#39;s ear, I guess? (Feel free to substitute another piece of Trump&#39;s anatomy if you think <em>ear</em> doesn&#39;t properly convey <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/02/07/trump-isnt-going-to-like-this/">their apparent power dynamic</a> — which, in turn, might answer my question re: the need Cook sees to appease Musk.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Cook, on His Favorite Website, Teases Apple Product Launch Next Week’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Account Purchase Migration Doesn&#39;t Transfer TestFlight Enrollments </title><link href="https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991894534107860" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/apple-account-purchase-migration-doesnt-transfer-testflight-enrollments" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41573</id><published> 2025-02-13T21:15:47Z</published><updated> 2025-02-14T16:47:26Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sean Heber, of The Iconfactory:</p><blockquote><p> It appears that Apple&#39;s new account migration stuff does NOT work for TestFlight access. That by itself is fine - whatever. The problem here is that it appears when someone does an account migration, it kind of half-migrates TestFlight somehow.</p><p> People are telling us their new email address to invite but TestFlight thinks they&#39;re already a tester with that email address! So you can&#39;t just reinvite them. It seems we have to filter for the user, remove them, then add them as a new tester.</p></blockquote><p> Heber subsequently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991948583471243">replied to his own thread</a> :</p><blockquote><p> lol - update. We tried this with a tester. I removed them from TestFlight and then re-added with their new email. They got the invite and then the TestFlight app said they can&#39;t be added because they&#39;re already on TestFlight with the email address that was just invited.</p><p> The workaround was to generate a public TestFlight link and use that. My guess is it uses some kind of token as a key for that system and not their email address. Seems to work around it. Except now there&#39;s a public link. At least I can limit how many can use it and only those who migrated and need a reinvite will get this link for now.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry/113992059015348611">His colleague Craig Hockenberry</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If you&#39;re hearing from testers about being kicked out of TestFlight because of the new account migration stuff, DO NOT update their email. It&#39;s a lot of work and will not help them.</p><p> For now, you MUST give them a public link, even if it&#39;s a private beta.</p></blockquote><p> TestFlight enrollment <em>is</em> on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/113993498493892147">the list of things</a> that you&#39;re warned are not included with migration (the other two are personalized recommendations and the ability to edit App Store reviews you&#39;ve left with your secondary account), but it sounds like the post-migration TestFlight situation is a little worse than just “not migrated, start over”. You need some actual assistance from the developer of each app you&#39;re testing. (I&#39;m an edge case, to be sure, but I&#39;m enrolled in about 30 active TestFlights across Mac and iOS.)</p><p> Still, though, it seems like practical experience with this purchase migration has gone well for almost everyone. I think Apple might have nailed this.</p><p> <strong>Update, 14 February:</strong> Apple has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/14/apple-adds-new-requirement-for-migrating-purchases-between-accounts/">added a new requirement</a> before proceeding with migration:</p><blockquote><p> You can&#39;t migrate purchases if your secondary Apple Account is used with TestFlight for testing beta versions of apps from a developer.

<p>Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> Apple this month started advertising on X for the first time in more than a year. The company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">had stopped advertising</a> on the social media platform in November 2023 following controversial remarks made by its owner Elon Musk.</p><p> For example, the @Apple account is <a href="https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659">running an ad</a> promoting Safari&#39;s privacy features. The ad was spotted by MacRumors contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a> . The @AppleTV account has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdtechBrags/status/1888708923651440701">also been running ads</a> for the Apple TV+ show Severance.</p></blockquote><p> The November 2023 outrage was in response to, among other things, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299">Musk replying</a> “You have said the actual truth” to <a href="https://x.com/breakingbaht/status/1724892505647296620">a tweet from a rando</a> that stated “I&#39;m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don&#39;t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.”</p><p> Musk clearly learned his lesson. Since then, he&#39;s been lying low, out of the public eye, and refraining from any sort of controversial statements or actions. He barely even tweets anymore. The one and only time I can recall him even being in the news in the last 18 months was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1">this year-ago profile in the Wall Street Journal</a> documenting Musk&#39;s health and nutrition regimen.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> The Apple TV app is now available to download from Google Play on Android mobile devices — including phones, tablets, and foldables — offering Android users access to hit, award-winning Apple Original series and films on Apple TV+, along with MLS Season Pass, the home of Major League Soccer.</p><p> Available around the world, the Apple TV app for Android was built from the ground up to deliver Android users a familiar and intuitive interface. Android users can subscribe to Apple TV+ and MLS Season Pass using their Google Play account on Android mobile and Google TV devices. Apple TV+ also offers a seven-day free trial.</p><p> The Apple TV app on Android includes key features like Continue Watching to pick up where a user left off across all their devices, and Watchlist to keep track of everything they want to watch in the future. The app streams seamlessly over Wi-Fi or a cellular connection, and includes the ability to download to watch offline.</p></blockquote><p> One thing that&#39;s funny about this press release is that no one from Apple is quoted in it. Not just not Eddy Cue, but no one, not even a lieutenant under Cue. The second-paragraph quotes from executives are where these press releases contain their superlatives proclaiming how awesome the news is. Eg <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/">last week&#39;s announcement for the new Apple Invites app</a> — the second paragraph is a quote from Brent Chiu-Watson, a senior director of product marketing. They didn&#39;t want to include one of those sugary quotes saying how frigging awesome it is that there&#39;s now an Apple TV app for Android, and that it works great and if you use an Android device you can still have a great Apple TV experience.</p><p> But the Apple TV app <em>does</em> seem frigging awesome, and it does seem like if you use an Android device you can now have a great Apple TV experience. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dcseifert/113993082733612319">Here&#39;s Dan Seifert</a> , longtime writer and editor for The Verge, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcseifert/">who left for a position at Google</a> as “product critic” a year ago:</p><blockquote><p> thrilled to see Apple TV land on Android devices today!</p><p> it&#39;s an excellent Android citizen too:</p><p> themeable app icon: ✅<br /> PIP support: ✅<br /> offline downloads: ✅<br /> foldable posture support: ✅</p></blockquote><p> (Also perhaps ever so slightly interesting that in its announcement, Apple positioned “foldables” as an entirely separate third category from phones and tablets. I wouldn&#39;t make a big deal of that — I&#39;m not sure how else they could mention that the app supports “foldable posture”.)</p><p> I&#39;m most curious about why it took so long for this to happen. Apple Music launched (albeit as a beta) for Android almost 10 years ago. ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/11/10/apple-music-android">Eddy Cue then</a> : “The menus will look like Android, you know the little hamburger they use on the top. It&#39;ll definitely feel very much like an Android app.”) And, what I think is a related question as to why this took so long: Is Google taking its usual Play Store cut from subscriptions to TV+ made in the app?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Apple TV App Is Now Available on Android’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/apple-tv-app-for-android">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Wikitok是如何创建的</title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/new-wikitok-web-app-allows-infinite-tiktok-style-scroll-of-wikipedia/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/how-wikitok-was-created" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41569</id><published> 2025-02-12T22:17:28Z</published><updated> 2025-02-12T22:17:29Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Benj Edwards, writing at Ars Technica:</p><blockquote><p> The original idea for WikiTok originated from developer Tyler Angert on Monday evening when he <a href="https://x.com/tylerangert/status/1886560290864533983">tweeted</a> , “insane project idea: all of wikipedia on a single, scrollable page.” Bloomberg Beta VC James Cham <a href="https://x.com/jamescham">replied</a> , “Even better, an infinitely scrolling Wikipedia page based on whatever you are interested in next?” and Angert <a href="https://x.com/tylerangert/status/1886560560654794930">coined</a> “WikiTok” in a follow-up post.</p><p> Early the next morning, at 12:28 am, writer Grant Slatton <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1886647932252020984">quote-tweeted</a> the WikiTok discussion, and that&#39;s where Gemal came in. “I saw it from [Slatton&#39;s] quote retweet,” he told Ars. “I immediately thought, &#39;Wow I can build an MVP [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable product</a> ] and this could take off.&#39;”</p><p> Gemal started his project at 12:30 am, and with help from AI coding tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Anthropic&#39;s Claude</a> and <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a> , he finished a prototype by 2 am and <a href="https://x.com/Aizkmusic/status/1886669151516705028">posted the results</a> on X.

<p>WikiTok is the creation of Isaac Gemal. The premise is that it&#39;s a TikTok-style interface for random articles from Wikipedia. One thing at a time on screen, swipe up to scroll down to the next item whenever you&#39;re ready, and you can keep going forever if you want. But instead of videos that tend toward mindless media-diet calories, these are facts. WikiTok has no videos at all — each item is just a full-bleed image and a summary factoid. (And, of course, a “Read More” link to open the full Wikipedia entry in a new browser tab.) It&#39;s not going to beat the actual TikTok on engagement, but TikTok can&#39;t beat WikiTok for mental nourishment. It&#39;s like choosing to snack on something that isn&#39;t junk.</p><p> WikiTok works on any size device, but like TikTok, it&#39;s clearly meant to be used on a phone. Save it to your home screen, and it&#39;s like having an app. During this interim between the NFL season and March Madness (and after that, baseball) I&#39;ve freed up a space on my first home screen from Apple Sports, and for the moment, I&#39;ve put WikiTok there. I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll last. The “hit rate” for things that actually interest me is kind of low — but maybe that&#39;s what TikTok itself is like? And, every time I launch it, I learn something interesting within a few swipes. There&#39;s no algorithm powering what it shows, but I wish there were — I&#39;d switch in a heartbeat to a fork of WikiTok that learns, even just a little, what sort of stuff actually interests me.尝试一下。 WikiTok&#39;s debut seems especially well-timed at the moment, given the alternative experience of checking the news.</p><p> If I could bend Gemal&#39;s ear for just one moment, I&#39;d beg him to consider changing the name from WikiTok to WikTok. That needless middle <em>i</em> syllable strikes a discordant note. Say what you want about TikTok, but it&#39;s a great fucking name. Verbally, <em>WikiTok</em> sounds like <em>WikiTalk</em> , which sounds like what Wikipedia editors might call the meta-discussion “Talk” pages for each entry. <em>WikTok</em> , on the other hand, works well both visually and verbally as a parallel to <em>TikTok</em> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘WikiTok — Web App With TikTok-Style Interface for Exploring Random Wikipedia Articles’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/wikitok">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Allison Johnson Reviews the Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus: &#39;Incredibly Iterative&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/johnson-samsung-galaxy-s25" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41567</id><published> 2025-02-12T20:10:13Z</published><updated> 2025-02-15T20:39:26Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Allison Johnson, writing at The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S-series is in its software era. Maybe the whole smartphone industry is, too, save for a few phones with hinges (Samsung&#39;s included). But overall, we have exited the hardware-driven innovation cycle and are firmly in the midst of a software-based one. If you want proof, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus are a good place to start. [...]</p><p> This was all true of the S24 and S24 Plus and the S23 and S23 Plus. I couldn&#39;t give you a good reason why the S25 stands out compared to Samsung&#39;s last three generations of S-series phones. I don&#39;t think Samsung can, either, because its entire sales pitch for the S25 revolves around software and AI capabilities — much of which will almost certainly be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24348631/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on-price-camera-specs#:~:text=Samsung%20smartphone%20product%20manager%20Blake%20Gaiser%20told%20me%20Samsung%20will%20bring%20its%20new%20AI%20features%20to%20older%20devices%20where%20possible.">ported to previous S-series phones</a> in short order.</p></blockquote><p> When an innovative device form factor settles into maturity, the shift from groundbreaking new hardware dropping every few years to iterative evolution stands out. The heady, go-go years of iPhone-derived touchscreen smartphones (including iPhones themselves) weren&#39;t that long ago. Iterative evolution is, let&#39;s face it, more boring. Or at least it&#39;s not exciting.但这是不可避免的。</p><p> The laptops that established the form factor were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_100_series">the PowerBook 100 series</a> , which Apple shipped at the end of 1991. (Before the PowerBooks, laptops generally lacked built-in pointing devices, and <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/the-luggable-laptop-how-does-it-look-today-part-ii-toshiba-t3200-from-1989-6d15ce56eadd">were more like briefcases</a> . Apple&#39;s own <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook/specs/mac_portable.html">1989 Macintosh Portable was more like a suitcase</a> .) Steve Jobs pulled <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/specs/macbook-air-core-2-duo-1.6-13-specs.html">the original MacBook Air</a> out of its manila envelope in January 2008. Everything since then, for laptops, has been iterative.</p><p> The stretch from PowerBook 100 series to MacBook Air was about 15 years, give or take. The “smartphones are boring now” complaints really started to hit a few years ago — about 15 years after the 2007 original iPhone. Somewhere in the second decade is when year-over-year changes start to become more and more iterative. But compound interest generates tremendous wealth over time. People wrongly think Apple&#39;s success is forged mostly by spectacular groundbreaking products, but the true key to their success is nonstop iterative improvement. That, as I wrote in 2010, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">is how Apple actually rolls</a> . You wouldn&#39;t want to use a 2010 MacBook Pro today. There will be small generational leaps and innovations to come (including, perhaps, an “iPhone Air” this year — and future leaps like 2020&#39;s debut of Apple Silicon), but the wheels of technological progress are mostly done wowing us with one-, two-, and maybe even three-year improvements to phones. But trading in a phone older than that should continue to pack a significant amount of <em>wow</em> .所以去了。</p><p>约翰逊：</p><blockquote><p> Maybe this says more about what passes for a “small” phone in 2025, but the Galaxy S25 is secretly the best small Android phone you can buy in the US. That&#39;s probably not intentional — more like a victory in a war of attrition. Google&#39;s phones since the Pixel 5 only come in big and bigger, and niche small phone options like the Asus Zenfone have dropped out of the race. By merely continuing to exist with a 6.2-inch screen, the smaller S-series model has become the default option if you don&#39;t want a huge Android phone.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel?hl=en-US">Google&#39;s Pixel 9 and 9 Pro</a> have 6.3-inch displays, not too much bigger than the S25, but the trend is clear.

<p>From the Apple Newsroom archive, dateline “Macworld Expo, San Francisco — January 5, 2000”:</p><blockquote><p> Apple today took the wraps off its highly anticipated Internet strategy, introducing a new category of Internet services called iTools; a completely redesigned Apple.com web site featuring iReview and iCards; and a multi-year partnership and investment with Earthlink for Internet access (see related release).</p><p> iTools is a revolutionary new category of Internet services that takes advantage of Apple&#39;s unique technology on both ends of the Internet — the operating system on the client side (Mac OS 9) and the services software running on Apple&#39;s Internet servers (iTools). Providing the software on both ends of the Internet offers Apple the unprecedented ability to offer services impossible to implement solely on Internet servers.</p><p> “Our new iReviews, iCards and the revolutionary iTools offer amazing new ways for Mac users to take full advantage of the Internet,” said Steve Jobs, Apple&#39;s iCEO. “Mac users can now do things on the Internet that Wintel users can only dream of.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s striking in hindsight how much Apple, circa 2000, was unabashedly the scrappy underdog. If an announcement is truly highly anticipated you don&#39;t have to describe it as “highly anticipated”. And that Jobs quote, including the colloquial “Wintel”.</p><p> And from the feature list:</p><blockquote><p> Mac.com, an email service run by Apple. Mac.com gives users an exclusive address on the Internet and works with standard POP email clients, such as Outlook Express, Eudora and Netscape Communicator. Mac.com users can easily set up automatic replies and forwarding of their email to other email addresses, and configure Outlook Express for their Mac.com mailbox from a simple web page.</p></blockquote><p> So I misremembered the timeline of how I got into my bifurcated Apple Account situation <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">earlier today</a> (but I was correct in that post to be uncertain of the timeline). My @mac.com address did predate the debut of the iTunes Music Store, but I&#39;ve had it since iTools was announced in January 2000, not when .Mac (worst Apple name ever?) was announced in July 2002. ( <a href="https://mastodon.mit.edu/@Eggfreckles/113988325606848730">Thanks to Thomas Brand</a> for reminding me.) The branding evolution is:</p><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2000/01/05Apple-Unveils-Internet-Strategy/">iTools</a> (2000) → <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/07/17Apple-Launches-Mac/">.Mac</a> (2002) → <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/06/09Apple-Introduces-MobileMe-Internet-Service/">MobileMe</a> (2008) → <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/06/06Apple-Introduces-iCloud/">iCloud</a> (2011)</p><p> It took Apple a decade to get from iTools to iCloud, but iCloud has proven to be a winner. It&#39;s interesting to think of the “Internet moment” circa 2000 compared to the “AI moment” today. Circa 2000, the hot new companies didn&#39;t make computers or devices, and they didn&#39;t make software that ran on consumer devices. They made websites and web apps that ran in browsers on devices.</p><p> The bear case against Apple then was that they&#39;d missed the boat on the big new thing, and their core strengths were no longer relevant. Pretty much the same bear case now re: AI. The difference is that Apple today is not only not a “scrappy underdog” — they&#39;re the most valuable company in the world.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iTools, Apple’s Original ‘Internet Strategy’, From January 2000’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/itools">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple完成了像素机器人的收购</title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41564</id><published> 2025-02-12T00:48:13Z</published><updated> 2025-02-12T00:48:14Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>New Apple support document dropped today:</p><blockquote><p> You can choose to migrate apps, music, and other content you&#39;ve purchased from Apple on a secondary Apple Account to a primary Apple Account.

You&#39;ll need access to the primary email address or phone number and password for both accounts, and neither account should be shared with anyone else.

I really never thought I&#39;d see this day when Apple finally made this possible. This document presents a solution to a situation I&#39;ve been in (and with each subsequent media purchase, digging deeper into) for over 20 years.</p><p> This whole thing started so long ago that I can&#39;t even recall exactly how I got into this. As best I can recall it went something like this. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2003/04/28Apple-Launches-the-iTunes-Music-Store/">When Apple launched the iTunes Music Store in April 2003</a> , I created my store account using an @daringfireball.net email address. In some sense that seems like an odd choice in hindsight, insofar as that&#39;s my “work” address, but at the time (even though Daring Fireball was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2002/08/baby_needs_a_new_pair_of_processors">less than a year old</a> ) it felt like my best “forever” email address. I felt very certain from the start I&#39;d be doing this forever.</p><p> I chose to use my DF email address for the iTunes Store in 2003 despite the fact that I had created my @mac.com email address in the summer of 2002 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/07/17Apple-Launches-Mac/">when Apple launched .Mac</a> — a few weeks <em>before</em> I launched Daring Fireball. I signed up for .Mac to get a good username, “just in case” (although I didn&#39;t score “gruber” — someone beat me to it, despite the fact that I signed up during or soon after the end of the keynote in which .Mac was announced), but I never anticipated using it much. But .Mac became MobileMe, MobileMe became iCloud, and iCloud now is one&#39;s primary Apple Account. 20 years ago it just wasn&#39;t clear at all that the .Mac account I created would be so central to being an Apple platform user for decades to come.</p><p> So fast forward to today, and I&#39;ve had <em>two</em> Apple Accounts on every device I use for the last 20-or-so years. One for “Media and Purchases” (my original iTunes account, using the @daringfireball.net address), and my primary Apple ID (the @mac.com address). All my purchases — all the music, books, apps, subscriptions, and thousands of dollars in movies that I&#39;ve purchased with that iTunes account over the years — are using an Apple Account that&#39;s <em>not</em> my iCloud account.</p><p> Apple has made this bifurcation work pretty well over the years, seemingly not just because many longstanding customers are in the same boat as me, but many Apple employees are themselves passengers on that boat. “Just make it so you can transfer purchases from a secondary old account to your primary one” sounds easy, conceptually, but apparently it was devilishly tricky under the hood.</p><p> But it seems Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117267">has figured it out and implemented a solution</a> . I&#39;ll wait and let others try this before I do ( <em>if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it</em> ), but if any of you try this, I&#39;m curious how it goes — especially if you&#39;re part of a family sharing group.</p><p> ( <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/113987244286363899">Via Chris Espinosa</a> , who I suppose counts as both a longstanding employee <em>and</em> customer.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Support: ‘About Migrating Apple Account Purchases Between Accounts’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;The Wild True Story Behind Kendrick Lamar&#39;s Super Bowl Halftime Show&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/wired-kendrick-lamar-halftime-show" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41562</id><published> 2025-02-11T22:51:02Z</published><updated> 2025-02-11T22:51:26Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Angela Watercutter, with a great behind-the-scenes look at the Apple-Music-sponsored halftime show by Kendrick Lamar:</p><blockquote><p> While “making it work” means one thing when you&#39;re putting on a Madonna concert or the Democratic National Convention, it means something different when you&#39;re trying to squeeze it into a national title match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles 。 For one, you have to get all of the staging, lights, dancers, and the artist themselves onto the field in 7.5 minutes and then get them off 6 minutes after the final note. For another, you have to do all of this on a field where the biggest NFL game of the year is being played — without screwing up the turf.</p></blockquote><p> It seems like a great ongoing relationship for Apple Music to sponsor these halftime shows. Amazon Prime has Thursday Night Football, and Google&#39;s YouTube TV has the NFL Sunday Ticket package (which Apple seriously bid for, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4024544/2022/12/21/nfl-sunday-ticket-apple-youtube/">but didn&#39;t get</a> ). That leaves Apple TV+ as the biggest streaming platform from a big tech company that doesn&#39;t have any NFL games. Sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show gives the NFL a relationship with Apple.</p><p> And Apple seems happy to let the shows themselves be artist-centric. This was Kendrick Lamar&#39;s show, presented by Apple Music — not Apple Music&#39;s show featuring Kendrick Lamar. I could be wrong, but I think the old Pepsi halftime shows were more Pepsi-centric, more focused on spectacle than showmanship. There were some small lyrical adjustments, but those might have been at the NFL&#39;s behest more than Apple&#39;s.

<p>A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_bug">scorebug</a></em> is industry jargon for the sub-genre of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chyron">chyron</a> (itself jargon) that shows ever-present information about a televised sporting event while you&#39;re watching. These graphics display the teams, the score, the time remaining, and other metadata pertaining to the current situation. The current ball/strike count in baseball. The down and yards-to-go in football. The shot clock in basketball.那种事情。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-10">1</a></sup></p><p> Fox was the broadcast network for Super Bowl 59 yesterday, in which the Philadelphia Eagles utterly embarrassed the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 (but which felt like a score of 114-0). The NFL rotates the Super Bowl annually between the networks that broadcast games. Fox has a tradition of unveiling updated on-screen graphics packages when it has the Super Bowl. This year, they didn&#39;t just tweak the design, they completely re-thought it and redesigned it.</p><p> First, here&#39;s Fox&#39;s familiar old scorebug, as captured from their broadcast of Super Bowl 57, a game that <em>also</em> pitted the Eagles against the Chiefs two years ago. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-10">2</a></sup></p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-old-2160.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

  /></a></p><p> Here&#39;s the new scorebug they debuted last night, in front of the biggest sports audience of the year:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-new-2160.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

    alt="Screen capture of Fox’s new scorebug, during Super Bowl 59 last night."
  /></a></p><p> I noticed the change immediately (of course), and my knee-jerk instant reaction was negative. <em>Too big, too bold, too different.不喜欢。</em>那很自然。 Human beings evolved to be alarmed by change. If everything looks the same as usual, everything is probably as safe as usual. If something looks jarringly different, it might be a sign that you&#39;re about to be killed. (Evolutionarily speaking.)</p><p> So I started studying and <em>considering</em> the changes to Fox&#39;s scorebug. I quickly not only warmed up to the new scorebug, I decided I <em>really</em> like it. It&#39;s better than Fox&#39;s old one, and better than every other network&#39;s (which all largely look the same), in almost every single regard.</p><p> I like the new scorebug so much I (cross-)posted about it to social media during the game. My posts, in order of engagement: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">Threads</a> (~6,600 likes, ~700 replies and reposts), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">Bluesky</a> (~3,900 likes, ~600 replies and reposts), and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">Mastodon</a> (179 likes, 53 replies and reposts).</p><p> No change an app developer can make will generate more commentary and emotional feedback from users than changing the app&#39;s icon. Everyone sees an app&#39;s icon, and has an opinion about them. That opinion, after a change, is usually “ <em>I like the old icon and hate the new one.</em> ” Likewise with a game broadcast&#39;s scorebug — everyone sees them, and everyone has an opinion when they change. Most reactions to Fox&#39;s new scorebug were negative, and many of those were <em>really</em> negative. Yahoo Sports ran a story under the headline “ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">Super Bowl: Fox Sports Debuts New Scorebug, to Universally Negative Reaction</a> ”. The sports media-focused site Awful Announcing ran a take by Drew Lerner under the headline “ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">Please Stop Debuting New Scorebugs During the Super Bowl</a> ” (subhead: “Can&#39;t I just watch one Super Bowl without having to learn a new graphic?” ）。 I have not even come close to reading all the replies to my social media take (well, except on Mastodon — it was quick to catch up there), but if you peruse them, you&#39;ll be quick to see that most replies are from people who despise the change. A representative tasting:</p><p> “ <em>It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn&#39;t bother having someone check it first.可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “<em>哈哈。 Muted for being a dumbass.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>It&#39;s hideous, and its overbearing size distracts from the actual content of the game.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don&#39;t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.</em>透明</p><p>“Looks like something out of Fortnite” isn&#39;t the dis the last commenter thinks it is. A lot of people play and love Fortnite.</p><p> Here&#39;s an expanded (from what I posted to social media) version of why I like, perhaps even love, the new scorebug. First, the primary items: who&#39;s playing and what&#39;s the score:</p><ul><li> <em>Team initialisms</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Team logos</em> : None. Colors say enough.</li><li> <em>Score</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Game clock</em> : Big enough and centered.</li><li> <em>Needless chrome</em> : None.</li></ul><p> Every team in the league is known by fans by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation of its home location, sort of like airport codes or stock tickers. They&#39;re all obvious ( <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">unlike many</a> airport codes). The Dallas Cowboys are DAL. The New England Patriots are NE. For the two cities which have two teams, New York and Los Angeles, the cities conveniently abbreviate to two letters and a third letter is drawn from the team nicknames: the Giants and Jets are NYG and NYJ; the Rams and Chargers are LAR and LAC.</p><p> Team logos are not as instantly identifiable, especially at small sizes. A bunch of teams have angry bird mascots: Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Cardinals. Do you remember the Tennessee Titans&#39; logo? Or the Houston Texans&#39;? The Cleveland Browns don&#39;t even have a logo to speak of. (And they&#39;re also not brown.) But I guarantee you know which teams are TEN, HOU, and CLE. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p> And, importantly, these team initialisms are not represented by typography alone: they are in a box with the team&#39;s primary color. That use of color does all the branding work necessary, and does it more effectively, at small sizes or viewed from far distances, than the team logos. (One small niggle I have is that the team initialisms are big white letters but are outlined by the team&#39;s secondary color. If you look closely at my screen capture from yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl above, you&#39;ll see that “KC” is outlined in yellow and “PHI” in silver. This has the effect, at a normal viewing distance, of making the initialisms look a little fuzzy. The secondary color outlines are too subtle to have their intended effect of further branding the teams, and instead have the unintended effect of making the text look poorly rendered on screen. I bet Fox tweaks this by next year.)</p><p> The elimination of all needless chrome is arguably the most striking change of all, because Fox&#39;s old scorebug had the most chrome with the most superfluous “3D” styling and textures. This isn&#39;t minimalism, per se, but it&#39;s a strike against needless decoration — reminiscent to my mind of Jony Ive&#39;s radical redesign of iOS 7 a decade ago. Elements that can be conveyed by type and color alone <em>are</em> expressed by type and color alone.</p><p> Other noteworthy features:</p><ul><li><p> <em>Timeouts remaining</em> : Prominent but not distracting. Seeing how many timeouts a team has remaining was a huge problem with Fox&#39;s old scorebug, and with most other networks&#39; current scorebugs. (Remaining timeouts are very important in close football games.)</p></li><li><p> <em>Current down and yards to go indicator (eg “1st &amp; 10”)</em> : Placement atop the team initialism conveys which team has the ball. Fox&#39;s old scorebug did have a “possession” indicator, but scroll back up to look at it, and see how long it takes you to figure out what it is. I&#39;ll put the answer in a footnote. <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p> <em>Typography</em> : Classic, legible, bold, timeless. It is also very “Fox” — the C in “KC” looks like the O in the classic “FOX” wordmark, and the zero (a digit Chiefs fans became very familiar with until the final seconds of the third quarter, because that&#39;s how many points they&#39;d scored until then — the Eagles cycled through a bunch of different digits en route to taking a 34-0 lead) looks pretty much exactly like the uppercase o in “FOX”.</p></li></ul><p> Bigger and bolder typography adds clarity. But removing the background chrome lets viewers “see through” to any game action that happens at the bottom of the screen. To me, after just one game, the old Fox scorebug looks hopelessly dated; old-fashioned without any nostalgic charm. If anything, the new typography-first design is the one that looks timeless, evocative of the graphics from classic NFL Films productions.</p><hr /><p>这是什么。 NFL broadcasts didn&#39;t always have scorebugs. I don&#39;t mean that they had smaller score indicators on screen. I mean they had none at all. This was true for all major sports on TV, not just football (eg the premise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">this gag from <em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a> ). Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials. But while the game played, there was no score on screen. Part of that is technology: game telecasts were low-fidelity over-the-air transmissions to relatively small TV screens that were viewed from across the room. Go back far enough and there wasn&#39;t even color. But a bigger aspect is inertia. Not showing the score at all times was the way games were always broadcast, so it was the way they were still broadcast.</p><p> Then came Fox.</p><p> For decades, there were three major TV networks in the US: ABC, NBC, and CBS. CBS had the Sunday game rights to the superior National Football Conference. “Superior” for the related reasons of team popularity <em>and</em> <a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">team market size</a> , which matters for ratings. Chicago, Philly, Washington, Dallas, Frisco. NBC had the Sunday game rights for the American Football Conference with teams from generally smaller cities. Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Miami. Good teams, but smaller cities. (In 1993, though, NFC teams had won 9 consecutive Super Bowls.)</p><p> Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox network was an attempt — soon enough proven successful — to establish a fourth US network. At the time of their debut in 1987, Fox only had prime time programming on one night a week (Sundays, conveniently). In 1993 Murdoch and Fox upended the world of sports broadcasting by outbidding (stupid, tightfisted, hubristic) CBS for the rights to broadcast the NFC games on Sundays.</p><p> In 2018, Bryan Curtis published at The Ringer a comprehensive oral history of the deal and its consequences: “ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever</a> ”. If this sort of thing interests you at all, read that. It&#39;s a great story, well told.</p><p> But so in 1994 Fox took over the NFC broadcasts. They poached from CBS all the announcers, cameramen, directors, and producers. (CBS didn&#39;t need them anymore, because they had no football games to broadcast.) But while the voices announcing the game were familiar (including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">the best duo ever to do it</a> : John Madden and Pat Summerall), the look and feel of the broadcasts was intentionally new and fresh and, well, because it was Fox, brash. This included an innovation they called the “Fox Box”. Quoting from Curtis&#39;s oral history at The Ringer:</p><blockquote><p> <em>David Hill&#39;s most controversial idea about the NFL was his simplest: He thought the score and clock should have a permanent home on the screen — a feature that became known as the “Fox Box.” A noisy group of critics and rival executives thought the Fox Box was a terrible idea. It would clutter the screen and drive people away from blowouts. But Hill was convinced, because he&#39;d created a proto–Fox Box after a frustrating afternoon watching soccer in the UK</em></p><p> <strong>Hill:</strong> We&#39;d been out walking our dogs. We&#39;d come in, got a cup of tea, and switched the BBC on. I watched the game for a good 15 minutes. I don&#39;t know what the score is. I&#39;m thinking to myself, “Shit, I&#39;d really like to know what the score is.” So I thought, “That&#39;s easy. On a chyron, I&#39;ll just put it up in the corner.” So I did it.</p><p> <strong>Madden:</strong> Instead of saying, “No, that&#39;s a stupid idea, we got other things we have to do,” he said, “If the score and the time is the most important thing, why don&#39;t we just put it up and leave it there?” That&#39;s where the Fox Box came from. That was David Hill.</p><p> <strong>Dolgin:</strong> All the networks told us, “You&#39;re screwing this up. You&#39;re idiots to do this.”</p><p> <strong>Albert:</strong> The thought was, some networks won&#39;t leave the time and score up because it&#39;s a blowout and they didn&#39;t want you to <em>know</em> it&#39;s a blowout.</p></blockquote><p> The “Fox Box” idea wasn&#39;t just controversial, it was widely panned as stupid. The networks literally thought it would be better if many viewers didn&#39;t know the score. And when the Fox Box appeared, many critics agreed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">Dan Cox&#39;s review of Fox&#39;s opening week broadcast for Variety</a> , in September 1994:</p><blockquote><p> The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game. Fox Sports prexy David Hill has said it&#39;s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.</p><p>好吧，是的。 But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p></blockquote><p> Who seems stupid now? Imagine the outcry if Fox had broadcast yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl without any scorebug at all — you know, for those who would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business. Smokers want to smoke and would stay home if they couldn&#39;t, the argument went. Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better. But better necessarily implies different.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-10"><p> You know how when you&#39;re watching most TV channels — not just sports, but any sort of show at all — they keep a logo for the channel in one of the corners of the screen? Those omnipresent logos are called <em>bugs</em> (perhaps because everyone knows they&#39;re slightly annoying?). Hence: scorebug for an always-present score indicator. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-10"><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF Style Guide</a> has no entry for “Roman numerals” because no obscenities or expletives are strong enough to convey the policy. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-10"><p> The one matchup this design might not work great for would be a Rams-Chargers game, because in addition to sharing a city (and stadium), they even share the same team colors: blue and yellow.

<p>Well, the Philadelphia Eagles, of course, won the actual Super Bowl, winning in a romp so one-sided that they would have embarrassed the Chiefs <em>less</em> if they had pantsed Patrick Mahomes at the 50-yard line. But the second contest is for best commercial. And my vote goes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">to Nike</a> .</p><p> The problem with modern Super Bowl commercials is they&#39;re bland. Offensively bland. It really makes no sense to me. The commercial time is famously expensive — Fox was supposedly selling 30-second spots for last night&#39;s game for $8 million — but the sponsors who buy that time tend to squander it with absolute mindless pap.</p><p> Fewer and fewer sponsors each year, it seems, attempt to bring something actually interesting.不同的东西。 Something with some punch. Something that&#39;s <em>actually</em> funny. Something that makes you actually <em>feel</em> . You don&#39;t have to make a genuinely artistic short film, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I">Apple&#39;s Ridley-Scott-directed <em>1984</em> spot</a> heralding the introduction of the Macintosh — the ad that is justifiably regarded as the best commercial ever made. Some of what I&#39;d list among the best Super Bowl ads ever were silly gimmicks that revelled in their abject silliness, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Bowl">the “Bud Bowl” commercials</a> (featuring anthropomorphic bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light playing football) — very far from “high art” but very fun, and created specifically to be shown once and only once, in the context of the Super Bowl. One simple measure is whether the ads are memorable. Most of the ads in last night&#39;s game I forgot by the time the game resumed after the break.</p><p> I don&#39;t know why anyone would book and commission a Super Bowl commercial if they weren&#39;t trying to <em>do</em> something or <em>say</em> something memorable with the spot. Still, though, there are always at least a handful of standouts.</p><p> My favorite yesterday was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">Nike&#39;s “So Win” spot</a> , a heralding of its own — not for a new Nike product, but for the explosion in interest in women&#39;s sports, featuring WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark and a few other top women&#39;s athletes. Gorgeous black and white cinematography. Led Zeppelin&#39;s rollicking “ <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whole-lotta-love/580708374?i=580708471">Whole Lotta Love</a> ” as the soundtrack. And a righteous manifesto of a message, delivered with pitch-perfect gusto by narrator Doechii. Nike, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/nikes-super-bowl-ad-puts-women-athletes-center-stage-on-a-male-dominated-field/">it turns out</a> , hadn&#39;t run a Super Bowl ad since 1998, and they came back with a banger that to me reinvigorated the Nike brand. They&#39;ve been in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/former-nike-ceo-john-donahoe-leadership-lessons-choosing-ceo/">a bit of a free fall</a> and I think this ad was intended as much to inspire Nike employees as it was to female athletes and sports fans. (Shades of Apple&#39;s “Think Different” campaign.) I&#39;ve re-watched this spot a few times while writing this post and I like it more each time.</p><p> Honorable mentions:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/608476/openai-super-bowl-chatgpt-commercial">ChatGPT&#39;s branding spot</a> , positioning AI alongside historical breakthroughs in technology.喜欢它。 I think it was supposed to be a mystery until the very end of the 60-second spot who the ad was for and what exactly it was about, but I guessed “ChatGPT” about 5 seconds in. I kind of hate making a third comparison to an old Apple ad, but ChatGPT&#39;s spot does evoke — not as a rip-off, but homage — the 90-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAEPqUtra6E">“There are a thousand no&#39;s for every yes” opening film from WWDC 2013</a> , perhaps the nadir of Apple&#39;s post-Steve-Jobs grief.</li><li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoeGC-eL4I">Stella Artois</a> : David Beckham learns that he has a twin brother, named Other David Beckham, whom his parents abandoned at birth in America. Beckham sets off to meet him. Don&#39;t read anything more about it, just watch. Good kicker at the end, too.</li></ul><p> Dishonorable mention:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi</a> is a streaming platform owned by Fox. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Apparently</a> it&#39;s existed since 2014 and has been owned by Fox since 2020, but I&#39;d forgotten it existed until this week, when it was in the news as the streaming platform carrying the Super Bowl. Fox ran a couple of house ads, intended to promote Tubi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMDrZDhxWBs">about a young man born with a head shaped like a cowboy hat</a> . Memorable, yes, but the execution was revolting, not funny. The message I took was that Tubi is the streaming app that will make you feel grossed out.</li></ul> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nike&#39;s &#39;So Win&#39; Won the Super Bowl</title></entry><entry><link href="https://go.clerk.com/2n40MWr" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2f" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/02/clerk_--_complete_user_managem" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41559</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-02-10T22:04:37Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T22:04:38Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Looks like more of an Eddy scene than a Tim scene, but everyone&#39;s having fun. There&#39;s a reason this is the 11th Super Bowl held in New Orleans.</p><p> Should be a good football game, too. The Chiefs and Eagles are both very good teams (and <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/chiefs-senior-vp-of-football-operations-on-why-brett-veach-is-a-hall-of-fame-gm">both</a> very <a href="https://www.wsj.com/sports/football/nfl-super-bowl-howie-roseman-philadelphia-eagles-7b5a906d">well-run</a> franchises). There&#39;s a strong case to be made that these are the two best teams in the NFL this season. And without question they&#39;re two of the top four (I&#39;d add the Bills and Ravens). If you&#39;re only a casual fan, you might think that happens every year. A championship game, ideally, would always feature two of the very best teams. But that&#39;s often <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199301310buf.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199401300buf.htm">the</a> <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201402020den.htm">way</a> it <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202102070tam.htm">works</a> out. This year it did. What&#39;s similar about both the Chiefs and Eagles is that both teams are full of surprises and tricks — they often do things no one would expect. But even more often, <em>they do exactly what everyone expects them to do</em> , the most predictable thing possible, and it just can&#39;t be stopped even when the other team knows it&#39;s coming.

<p>Zara Stone, reporting for The Standard:</p><blockquote><p> “There&#39;s a renaissance happening now in Aaron Swartz-land,” said Lisa Rein, the co-founder of Creative Commons, a nonprofit devoted to expanding public access to information. She founded Aaron Swartz Day in 2013, an annual hackathon and tribute held on his birthday. There&#39;s now an Aaron Swartz Institute in Brazil, a documentary, multiple books and podcasts — even an Aaron Swartz memecoin (“Do not buy,” she warned).</p></blockquote><p> Aaron, I know, would have laughed at that.</p><blockquote><p> Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Twitch and a partner at Y Combinator, was one of the few people who knew Swartz personally. “I&#39;m glad he&#39;s become a symbol, he would approve of that,” he shared, his voice slightly breaking. “I really miss him.”</p></blockquote><p>我也想念他。男人。 But I find it weird that there were only “few people who knew him” at the event. So many people knew him. That&#39;s part of what made Aaron <em>Aaron</em> — he knew everyone interesting on the internet.</p><p> I&#39;m not so sure, either, that he&#39;d approve of all this, his status as a symbol to a generation who never knew him, only of him. I don&#39;t think he&#39;d <em>disapprove</em> , either, because the folks holding him up as an icon — internet freedom and preservationist zealots — are, thankfully, aligned with Aaron&#39;s own righteous obsessions. But I think he&#39;d be a little weirded out. He wasn&#39;t a “ <em>I hope they erect a larger-than-life statue of me</em> ” sort of guy. And if he had been, we wouldn&#39;t have loved him like we did. It&#39;s just a terrible thing that we lost him so young.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Internet Archive Unveils Marble Bust of Aaron Swartz’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/swartz-monument">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> tiktok现在正在通过侧载来分发其Android应用程序以进行安装</title><link href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1888048200486949249" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2c" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/tiktok-android-sideloading" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41556</id><published> 2025-02-08T23:40:44Z</published><updated> 2025-02-09T04:59:47Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>TikTok, on X:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re enhancing ways for our community to continue using TikTok by making Android Package Kits available at <a href="http://TikTok.com/download">http://TikTok.com/download</a> so that our US Android users can download our app and create, discover, and connect on TikTok.</p></blockquote><p> Tens of millions of users installing a binary straight from the Chinese Communist Party right to their phones — what could go wrong?</p><p> They also link to <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/getting-started/creating-an-account/download-tiktok">this support document</a> on their website, which includes these instructions for iOS:</p><blockquote><p>在iOS设备上访问tiktok：</p><ol><li> Go to www.tiktok.com/download.</li><li> Tap Add TikTok to Home Screen and follow the steps to create a shortcut to TikTok.com to the home screen on your device.</li></ol></blockquote><p> Which is another way of saying “Use the web app”, which is actually safe. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve always had this web app version of the app or if they scrambled to put it together during this standoff, but it&#39;s not bad. But it&#39;s got some very obvious layout glitches. (If you&#39;re a regular TikTok user, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on how this mobile web app compares to the actual native iOS app. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/contact/">Let me know</a> .)</p><p> I suspect something is going to give on this standoff. Either (a) China relents and actually sells to a US company, and TikTok comes back to the App Store and Play Store; or (b) <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">Trump&#39;s extralegal extension</a> expires with no sale and Oracle and Akamai are forced to pull the plug on ByteDance&#39;s cloud services in the US. Another extension is another possibility, of course, but I think Republican China hawks like Tom Cotton only have one grace period in them.我们看看。</p><p> If I&#39;m wrong and TikTok remains in this half-zombie state in the US — unavailable in the App Store or Play Store, but operational if you have the app installed on your phone — it&#39;ll be interesting if TikTok is the app that makes the mass market actually care about the lack of sideloading on iOS. It&#39;ll be interesting too if sideloading on Android goes mainstream because of this. This could be a fascinating experiment. Proponents of Apple permitting Mac-style software distribution on iOS often argue that normal people, who aren&#39;t technically adept or savvy — simply won&#39;t do it, because they don&#39;t care enough to jump through the hoops and click through the warnings about the risks of sideloading. But maybe TikTok is so popular it could break through. Not to mention the fact that ByteDance can use TikTok itself to algorithmically boost pro-sideloading videos, and perhaps even push a trend that if you care about TikTok, you should switch to Android.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘TikTok Is Now Distributing Its Android App for Installation via Sideloading’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/tiktok-android-sideloading">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>杰森·斯内尔（Jason Snell）去了那里，呼吁iOS遵循Mac模型进行软件分发</title><link href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2525708/the-app-store-era-must-end-apples-already-got-the-solution.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/snell-ios-direct-installation-of-apps" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41555</id><published> 2025-02-08T22:26:57Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T20:21:56Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, in a column for Macworld back in November ( <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/the-app-store-era-must-end-and-the-mac-is-the-model/">same column at Six Colors</a> , for members):</p><blockquote><p>这是一个重要的时刻。 Apple has built two separate models for running software on our devices. In one, there&#39;s a gradient of trustworthiness that strongly encourages users to stick to the safe, well-lit paths–but allows competitors to go their own way and users to make different decisions than Apple would prefer they make. And, yes, at the extremes, users can behave in ways that might open them up to danger, but only after many warnings. It&#39;s a very good system. Apple built it that way because it cares about the Mac, the Mac ecosystem, and Mac users.</p><p> Of course, the other model is the one we&#39;re familiar with from iOS: There&#39;s only one layer and Apple entirely controls it. Even though we&#39;re spending thousands of dollars to <em>own</em> devices that can run software developed by clever people from all over the world, Apple believes that only it should be able to determine what kinds of apps are allowed, that it should always be cut in on the revenue of every financial transaction inside those apps, and that if it doesn&#39;t like anything about a developer&#39;s app, it can demand it be changed or the app made to disappear into oblivion.</p><p> That both of these approaches come from the same company is… kind of staggering, to be honest. [...] I know which Apple-built approach should be the model for the future of software on computing devices. The good news is that Apple has already built it. The era of top-down control of our devices needs to end. The Mac is the model.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been itching to link to this since he wrote it, but I was torn between the urge to write something long, or just link to it and keep my commentary short. Short it is, for now. I don&#39;t think Snell is wrong. I know many — perhaps most? — of you reading this agree with him. I&#39;m quite certain that if iOS shifted to Mac-style rules for software distribution, I personally would enjoy it with zero downsides — I&#39;d gain access to software previously unavailable from the App Store (we could make <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/06/19/kotoba">Kotoba</a> a simple download, for example), new software that never existed in the first place due to App Store rules would spring into existence, and I&#39;m quite confident I&#39;d personally never once be tricked or fooled into installing even a single piece of software I&#39;d later come to regret. So if Apple were ever to follow Snell&#39;s advice — whether by a change of mind in Cupertino, or begrudgingly at the figurative gunpoint of government regulation — I would personally come out happier for it. So too, probably would you.</p><p> But I don&#39;t think Apple <em>should</em> do this, because I think there are tens of millions — maybe hundreds of millions — of iPhone users who would wind up installing apps they&#39;d come to regret having installed. An updated, longer take from me on this will have to wait, but for now, I direct your attention to these previous takes on at least some aspects of this:</p><ul><li> June 2021: “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">Annotating Apple&#39;s Anti-Sideloading White Paper</a> ”</li><li> November 2021: “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/11/federighi_sideloading_keynote_at_web_summit">Craig Federighi&#39;s Sideloading Keynote at Web Summit</a> ”</li><li> January 2024: “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement">Coming to Grips With Apple&#39;s Seemingly Unshakable Sense of Entitlement to Its Commissions From Third-Party iOS Apps</a> ”</li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell Went There, Calls for iOS to Follow the Mac Model for Software Distribution’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/snell-ios-direct-installation-of-apps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Torrenting From a Corporate Laptop Doesn&#39;t Feel Right&#39; </title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/meta-torrented-books-ai-training-lawsuit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41554</id><published> 2025-02-08T17:56:50Z</published><updated> 2025-02-08T23:15:33Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ashley Belanger, reporting for Ars Technica on new details from an authors group lawsuit alleging Meta trained its AI models on a trove of pirated books:</p><blockquote><p> Last month, Meta admitted to torrenting a controversial large dataset known as LibGen, which includes tens of millions of pirated books. But details around the torrenting were murky until yesterday, when Meta&#39;s unredacted emails were made public for the first time. The new evidence showed that Meta torrented “at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries through the site Anna&#39;s Archive, including at least 35.7 terabytes of data from Z-Library and LibGen,” the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Relief-2-5-25.pdf">authors&#39; court filing</a> said. And “Meta also previously torrented 80.6 terabytes of data from LibGen.”</p><p> Supposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to “avoid” the “risk” of anyone “tracing back the seeder/downloader” from Facebook servers, an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">internal message</a> from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as being in “stealth mode.” Meta also allegedly modified settings “so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur,” a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">deposition</a> .</p><p> Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again because the new facts allegedly “contradict prior deposition testimony.” Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the “decision to use LibGen occurred” after “a prior escalation to MZ,” authors alleged.</p></blockquote><p> Regardless of how you feel about AI training on public data, you have to be a zealot not to acknowledge that a lot of stuff falls into a gray zone. Torrenting 81 terabytes of pirated books is not in the gray zone. It&#39;s hilarious to imagine Zuckerberg giving the OK to pirate all these books, just not from the office.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Torrenting From a Corporate Laptop Doesn’t Feel Right’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/meta-torrented-books-ai-training-lawsuit">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/my_2024_apple_report_card" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w29" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41553</id><published> 2025-02-07T23:28:06Z</published><updated> 2025-02-19T17:18:51Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> While there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent excellence in 2024, I can&#39;t think of a single area where Apple levelled up.不是一个。 That feels like a problem. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>This week Jason Snell published his annual <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/" title="Six Colors: “Apple in 2024: The Six Colors report card”">Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2024</a> . As I&#39;ve done in the past — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/my_2023_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball: “My 2023 Apple Report Card”">2023</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/my_2022_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2022 Apple Report Card”">2022</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/my_2021_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2021 Apple Report Card”">2021</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/01/my_2020_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2020 Apple Report Card”">2020</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/my_2019_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2019 Apple Report Card”">2019</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2018 Apple Report Card”">2018</a> — I&#39;m publishing my full remarks and grades here. On Snell&#39;s report card, voters give per-category scores ranging from 5 to 1; I&#39;ve translated these to letter grades, A to F, which is how I consider them. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-07">1</a></sup></p><p> Most of my grades are unchanged from a year ago. For those that have changed, I&#39;ve noted last year&#39;s grade in parentheses. I didn&#39;t realize this as I was writing my report card, but each of my grades that changed from last year went <em>lower</em> . Not one grade went up. Thinking about that as I write this preamble today, it feels correct: there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent excellence in 2024, but I can&#39;t think of a single area where Apple levelled up.不是一个。 That feels like a problem. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-07">2</a></sup></p><!--less--><p> It&#39;s also worth noting that “Siri” is not a standalone category in the report card. We graders simply comment on it as one aspect within other categories and products, like HomePod or Apple Music. Historically that made sense — when it <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/10/04Apple-Launches-iPhone-4S-iOS-5-iCloud/">started</a> , Siri was just a flashy new feature of iOS 5. At this point, though, I think “Siri/Apple Intelligence” clearly deserves to be considered as a category unto itself. One way to think about it: anything that comprises the entire domain of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">senior Apple executive</a> probably ought to be its own category on the report card. For Siri and Apple Intelligence, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a> . For another: Apple&#39;s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=apple+intelligence+commercials">heavy marketing of Apple Intelligence</a> suggests they themselves consider it a category-level aspect of the company. I&#39;ve suggested this to Snell, and he&#39;s considering adding it as a proper category next year. (And, unsurprisingly, given his own <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/where-will-apple-intelligence-go-next/">sharp writing on the subject</a> , he was already thinking about it before I pinged him.)</p><p> If “Siri/Apple Intelligence” <em>were</em> a category for this report card, I&#39;d have graded it a D — and much closer to an F than a C. Longstanding Siri features have not only <em>not</em> gotten better, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">they&#39;ve seemingly gotten worse</a> 。 Apple is simply not a relevant player in the explosively popular LLM game. The features under the “Apple Intelligence” umbrella mostly feel like Apple shipped them a full year ahead of readiness simply because the rest of the industry — and Wall Street — is way ahead of them, and they felt the need to ship what they had,准备好了没。 There are a lot of obviously useful potential AI-powered features — ones that integrate between apps, and/or use your personal data on-device — that, thanks to the tightly restricted sandboxing system Apple itself designed for iOS, only Apple itself can provide via AI. It doesn&#39;t matter that Apple doesn&#39;t offer, say, its own web search engine, because Safari can use whatever search engine <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/kagi">you want</a> . It <em>does</em> matter that Siri sucks because only Siri can tightly integrate at the system level with your device, and with your private cross-application data. The saving grace — what kept me from giving this if-it-were-a-category category an F — is that a few of Apple&#39;s ML/AI features are actually pretty great. Image search in Photos is excellent, downright amazing at times. The new Clean Up generative AI object/person removal tool in Photos is very good — both technically, and in terms of striking an opinionated balance regarding the nature of photography itself. Private Cloud Compute is a tremendously ambitious initiative — but we haven&#39;t seen much fruit from it yet.</p><h2> Mac: A</h2><p> The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years. Even better, both now seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. Personally I am especially pleased, borderline ecstatic, regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150 extra. (They don&#39;t even charge more for the option on the 16-inch models than 14-inch.)</p><p> The only hitch in the lineup are the Macs Apple <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111835">remain</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111343">unchanged</a> since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC&#39;s first-generation 3nm process, and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC.</p><p> MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release. Reliable and familiar. Apple Intelligence features that I largely don&#39;t use (or at least don&#39;t use much <em>yet</em> ) are easily ignored and do not get in the way of what is tried and true about, by far, the greatest computing platform the world has ever看到。</p><h2> iPhone: A</h2><p>如果没有破产，请不要修复它。 Nothing has been broke regarding the iPhone lineup, and Apple hasn&#39;t tried to fix anything.这很好。 Changes for the sake of change are the surest sign of a company in decline. Stagnation and hubris are concerns for any wildly successful product, but it takes confidence to let great design speak for itself without making facile unnecessary changes.</p><p> Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I&#39;d like to see the actual button improve (I think it&#39;s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Also: kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models.</p><p> iOS 18 is refined, mature, and familiar.</p><h2> iPad: C</h2><p> The iPad hardware story is excellent. iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac, and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. (Please, Apple: bring nano-texture to the iPhone. Take my money.) The iPad Air got a fine update to the M2 chip in May. And the iPad Mini got its first update since 2021, and thus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/transcript-phil-schiller-craig-federighi-and-john-ternus-on-the-state-of-apples-pro-macs/">continues to be a product in Apple&#39;s lineup</a> .</p><p> But iPadOS still strikes me as the no-man&#39;s-land platform: nowhere near as capable productivity-wise as a Mac; nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months. I find myself noticeably more productive for it. Trying to work on an iPad, for me, continues to feel like trying to perform surgery while wearing mittens.</p><h2> Wearables Overall: B</h2><p> AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update. AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements this year — most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods continue to exemplify Apple at its best.</p><h2> Apple Watch: C (last year: B)</h2><p> Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn&#39;t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/faces-and-features-apde9218b440/watchos">Flux and Reflections</a> . Setting aside the fact that I personally don&#39;t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11 offers, by my quick count, at least 33 different watch faces that offer a non-digital seconds hand or indicator. And only 2 of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate?那是胡扯。 And it wasn&#39;t just a launch thing, because here we are in February, with WatchOS 11.3, and zero additional watch faces have been updated to support it. I will admit to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch">caring far more about always-on seconds hands than most people</a> , but this isn&#39;t how a serious watchmaker deals with technical breakthroughs like this new display with a 1Hz refresh rate. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch.</p><p> Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that&#39;s it. Kind of weird for a watch that starts at $800 — and that seems quite popular — to skip a year of silicon improvements.</p><h2> Vision Pro: B (last year: N/A)</h2><p> Is it a hit? No, far from it. But I remain <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/vision_pro_bites_dog">unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope</a> that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it&#39;s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today&#39;s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the primary impetus for John Sculley and Apple&#39;s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company. Many pundits of the era confidently proclaimed that the entire concept of a GUI was a gimmick with no future.</p><p> Am I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has <em>a</em> bright and essential future ahead of it. The entire concept and paradigm is so new and different that, like the Macintosh 40 years prior, the product had to ship years before a version will be made at a price that appeals to the mass market, and years before there&#39;s all that much to do使用它。</p><p> But, as it stands, Vision Pro today offers an incredible experience for watching traditional movies and shows, and a breakthrough experience for watching spatial content. If Bang &amp; Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price. Spatial computing feels fun to me, but not very productive. That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro&#39;s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118521">Mac Virtual Display</a> feature is a highly-productive environment for work.</p><p> I can&#39;t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A&#39;s in future years.</p><h2> Home: D (last year: C)</h2><p> I can&#39;t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something.</p><h2> Apple TV: C (last year: B)</h2><p> I&#39;m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024?任何事物？ It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we&#39;re grading what happened在2024年。</p><p> Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. The current one is their best yet, but it has obvious flaws.</p><h2> Services: B</h2><p> TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I&#39;d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: <em>Wolfs</em> should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+&#39;s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: <em>Slow Horses</em> had another crackerjack season, <em>For All Mankind</em> finished a good fourth season, and new shows like <em>Dark Matter</em> , <em>Bad Monkey</em> , and <em>Presumed Innocent</em> were all strong. TV+ is also a great streaming platform for young kids.</p><p> iCloud, especially with iCloud Plus, remains secure, fast, and reliable. It enables so much seamless continuity (hence Apple&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> ” umbrella brand for those features) across devices.</p><p> But here we are again, with me repeating the same gripe from previous years: it&#39;s miserly that Apple is still offering a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier, and have left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged since like forever. I crap bigger than 5 GB. I wonder how many zillions of iPhone users out there don&#39;t have device backups because they only have a free iCloud account with 5 GB? The Apple One bundle is a good deal, but the free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do.</p><h2> Hardware Reliability: A</h2><p> No news remains great news in this category.</p><h2> Apple OS Quality: B<br/> Apple Apps: B</h2><p> Unchanged comment, and grades, from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple&#39;s software <em>design</em> is headed (or in some ways, has been now for years), but their software <em>reliability</em> has been very good for me.</p><p> One odd trend: several of Apple&#39;s newest apps, like Journal and Sports (and now, though outside the temporal boundary for a 2024 report card, Invites) are only available for iPhone. Not even iOS, including iPhone and iPad. Just iPhone. Journal in particular belongs on iPadOS and MacOS, too, where people have hardware keyboards for writing.</p><h2> Developer Relations: D (last year: C)</h2><p> Fourth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple&#39;s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple&#39;s platforms. The opposite is happening.</p><p> The big change globally this year is the Digital Markets Act going into effect in the EU. I stand apart from many in the Cupertino punditry racket in applauding Apple for their compliance efforts. I think they&#39;ve complied with a terrible law as best they can while protecting their own vision for how their platforms should be designed and work. (And, of course, protecting their own vision for how Apple should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can&#39;t and won&#39;t argue that any of Apple&#39;s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers.</p><p> Despite the situation being largely unchanged, I&#39;ve adjusted my grade on this subject from C to D this year, because stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse. And I think we saw that with the relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro. There&#39;s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- <em>and</em> third-party apps and games.</p><p> With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform. That enthusiasm was tempered greatly last year for VisionOS, and I think it was a lot more about how developers feel about Apple and the App Store than how they feel about Vision Pro itself.</p><h2> Social and Societal Impact: B (last year: A)</h2><p> Snell&#39;s prompt for this category states, “Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple&#39;s work force, and other political and policy stances.” Apple&#39;s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary. Their accessibility features are so far ahead of the rest of the industry that I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s in second place. On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple&#39;s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now sharply right.</p><p> If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade. But: politics. I understand (I think) Tim Cook&#39;s thinking and approach. I wouldn&#39;t want his job, and genuinely wonder at times who would. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">Sing-song congratulatory tweets</a> leave a bitter taste, but I&#39;m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they&#39;ve been dealt, not the cards they&#39;d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don&#39;t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can&#39;t donate $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/the-great-american-tradition">a mere $43,200 to Biden&#39;s</a> and expect us to do anything but laugh at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">the supposed justification</a> that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That&#39;s Tim Cook&#39;s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it&#39;s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it.</p><p> I genuinely believe Cook is doing what&#39;s best for Apple, and that&#39;s quite literally his job. But it was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/cook_trump_campaign_ad">true during the first Trump administration</a> , and already is again in the second, that what&#39;s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what&#39;s best for the country and for the world.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-07"><p> In my previous report cards I&#39;ve described my scale as A to E (A = 5 ... E = 1), but here in the US, schools <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/9283/grading-system-why-a-f-and-not-e">traditionally</a> (but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uofu/comments/bofpny/what_is_the_difference_between_an_e_grade_and_an/">not always</a> ) omit E as a letter grade and use F as the grade below D, as the obvious shorthand for <em>fail</em> — and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">apparently</a> , to disambiguate from some weirdo schools that use a system in which E stands for <em>excellent</em> . (I give that grading system an F.) I never had to give the E vs. F thing much thought before, because I never thought it appropriate to give a failing grade in any category before. But pondering a hypothetical “Siri/Apple Intelligence” category this year got me thinking long and hard about a failing grade. And I realized that should be an F, not an E. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-07"><p> If you said to me, “ <em>Come on Grubes, you can&#39;t think of a</em> single <em>area where Apple did better in 2024 than 2023?不是一个？ There has to be something...</em> ” I would offer as a response, without hesitation, Apple TV original content. As I wrote just over a month ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/31/">in my final post of the year</a> , I would argue with anyone that the average quality of an Apple TV+ original show is higher than that for any other streaming platform. It really is the new HBO — not the most content, but the best content. That&#39;s very <em>Apple</em> .</p><p> But that&#39;s not a separate category on the Six Colors Report Card. Apple TV+ falls under “Services” (under which category I call it out for praise in this very report card), and my very high esteem for Apple TV+&#39;s original content doesn&#39;t justify bumping up my grade for “Services” as a whole — a sprawling category that, financially, a decade ago become Apple&#39;s second-biggest and is <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">seemingly on a trajectory</a> to <a href="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apple-earnings-1.png?ssl=1">eventually surpass even the iPhone</a> — from a B to an A.</p><p> I don&#39;t see Apple&#39;s foray into entertainment production as a distraction. The people at Apple working on computer hardware, software, and services, whether they be engineers, designers, managers, or even senior executives, aren&#39;t involved in any way with TV+. And it&#39;s not like Apple is cash-starved and diverting limited resources to entertainment production budgets at the expense of product development or R&amp;D. Apple, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, can act a bit like a conglomerate without losing focus on its core business of making the world&#39;s best computers, on which customers enjoy the world&#39;s best computing experiences. TV+ is an important leg on the stool of reasons for people to subscribe to an Apple One services bundle. But, still, it&#39;s at least a little worrisome that the area where I feel Apple most improved last year is one that is utterly unrelated to that core business.</p><p> Excellence, no matter how long sustained, is always precarious — delicate and fragile — and on the verge of succumbing to hubris and Father Time. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★我的2024 Apple成绩单</title></entry><entry><title>苹果对泄露信息和WSJ的前雇员解决了诉讼</title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/apple-leaker-issues-apology/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w28" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41552</id><published> 2025-02-07T18:10:53Z</published><updated> 2025-02-07T18:14:37Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> Last year, we reported that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/apple-sues-former-employee-for-alleged-leaking/">Apple sued its former software engineer Andrew Aude</a> for providing journalists with confidential information about the company&#39;s future plans, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/apple-launching-journaling-app/">details about the Journal app</a> , Vision Pro headset, and more.</p><p> As reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/07/former-leaker-sued-by-apple-has-now-apologized-as-the-lawsuit-is-dismissed/">by 9to5Mac</a> , the Superior Court of Santa Clara County on Thursday <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/825250528/Apple-Inc-v-Andrew-Aude-Stipulation-of-Dismissal">dismissed the lawsuit</a> after Apple and Aude reached an agreement to resolve this matter. The court document for the case&#39;s dismissal does not provide any specific details about the agreement, but Aude issued a public apology on the same day.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://x.com/andyaude1/status/1887639465574998500">Aude&#39;s apology, on X</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I spent nearly eight years as a software engineer at Apple. During that time, I was given access to sensitive internal Apple information, including what were then unreleased products and features. But instead of keeping this information secret, I made the mistake of sharing this information with journalists who covered the company. I did not realize it at the time, but this turned out to be a profound and expensive mistake. Hundreds of professional relationships I had spent years building were ruined. And my otherwise successful career as a software engineer was derailed, and it will likely be very difficult to rebuild it. Leaking was not worth it. I sincerely apologize to my former colleagues who not only worked tirelessly on projects for Apple, but work hard to keep them secret. They deserved better.</p></blockquote><p> We don&#39;t know the terms of Aude&#39;s agreement with Apple that ended the lawsuit, but it&#39;s good to see he and the company remain on close enough terms for Apple to have helped him craft that apology. (Either that, or Aude should have worked in Apple&#39;s comms department, not engineering.)</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/apple-sues-leaker-andrew-aude">Here&#39;s my post from last March</a> when the lawsuit was filed, which includes a few of the juiciest nuggets, including this, from Apple&#39;s filing:</p><blockquote><p> Apple learned of Mr. Aude&#39;s misconduct in the fall of 2023. When Apple met with him to discuss his improper disclosures, Mr. Aude promptly confirmed his guilt through his actions, if not his words. At the start of his November 7, 2023 interview, Mr. Aude repeatedly denied that he had leaked any information to anyone. He also claimed that he did not have his Apple-issued work iPhone with him. Feigning the need to visit the bathroom mid-interview, Mr. Aude then extracted his iPhone from his pocket during the break and permanently deleted significant amounts of evidence from his device. This included the Signal app, which memorialized his history of leaking information to “Homeboy” (and likely others) via encrypted communications. [...]</p><p> In Mr. Aude&#39;s screenshot below memorializing his exchange with the WSJ journalist, Mr. Aude exclaimed that he could not “wait for chaos to break out” in reaction to a forthcoming article reflecting his leaked information.</p></blockquote><p> End-to-end encrypted comms don&#39;t help much when you save screenshots of those chats to your work-issued company-controlled device.</p><p> And my own closing:</p><blockquote><p> Worth noting that Aaron “Homeboy” Tilley <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/u/aarontilley">was a reporter for The Information</a> until September 2019, when he left to join the WSJ. Anyway, I&#39;m sure the WSJ will help Aude out with his legal bills.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Settles Lawsuit Against Former Employee Who Leaked to The Information and WSJ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/bootable_mac_startup_drive_backups_and_another_ode_to_superduper" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w27" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41551</id><published> 2025-02-06T19:07:17Z</published><updated> 2025-02-15T20:37:25Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> I know how different storage is today — abundant, cheap, reliable — but I still have feelings about my data that are rooted in the distant past. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Dave Nanian, <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/happy_new_fix/">last week at the Shirt Pocket blog</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Just a quick post: macOS 15.3 is now out, and with it, a fix for the broken replicator. As such, macOS copying will work again with Erase, Then Copy backups. No update to SuperDuper is necessary (but feel free to install our v3.10 Beta 2, below). [...]</p><p> Thanks for your patience as we waited for the fix from Apple. I know I&#39;m relieved that I (hopefully) will no longer be bombarded with support because of it!</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/macos-15-2-bootable-backup-bug">You may recall</a> that this was a bug introduced in MacOS 15.2, which prevented Shirt Pocket&#39;s excellent <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/superduper">long-standing</a> utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a> from making a bootable clone of your startup drive. Great news, bug fixed, hurrah.</p><p> Back in December, though, when the bug had just started circulating, Mike Bombich, developer of <a href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> (the long-standing also-excellent archrival to SuperDuper), wrote a post that I took to suggest that he thought the bug was not a bug, “ <a href="https://bombich.com/blog/2024/12/19/bootable-backups-have-been-deprecated-for-several-years">Bootable Backups Have Been Deprecated for Several Years</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> While some developers seem surprised by a change in macOS 15.2, we&#39;ve known for several years that making bootable backups would eventually become impossible. We shifted CCC&#39;s strategy away from relying on External Boot so our users wouldn&#39;t be affected by this inevitable result.</p><p> I took a few days off last week to help a family member, and returned to find the Mac community all aflutter with comments about bootable backups not working after the 15.2 update and comparisons of Apple to The Grinch. After reviewing a lot of comments on this subject, I felt it was time to weigh in. Apple is taking a lot of heat for this “bug” in 15.2, but if there is any finger-pointing here, I think it should be directed towards any developers that have misled their users into believing that ASR and “bootable backups” had any place in a backup/recovery strategy post-Big Sur.</p></blockquote><p> That feels like some shade thrown toward Nanian and Shirt Pocket, but here we are with MacOS 15.3, and bootable startup drive clones are back, so I have to question who needs to don sunglasses here.</p><p> I don&#39;t think anyone would dispute that “creating a bootable startup drive clone” has gotten complicated in the Apple Silicon era, which began with MacOS 11 Big Sur in late 2020. Not to mention the complications that were introduced with the switch from HFS+ to APFS with MacOS 10.13 High Sierra in 2017, and the read-only boot volume and SIP with MacOS 10.15 Catalina in 2019. M-series Macs boot weirder than Intel-based Macs. Not <em>bad</em> weird. I think it&#39;s all justified in the pursuit of security (SIP stands for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102149" title="Apple Support: “About System Integrity Protection on your Mac”">System Integrity Protection</a> , and is aptly named) and elegant system architecture. But booting is now <em>makes-things-much-more-difficult-than-before</em> weird for tools like SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner.</p><p> It&#39;s also true that from the perspective of <em>most</em> Mac users, all of these changes have been, unambiguously, changes for the better. Catastrophic boot drive errors seem to occur with less frequency than ever. Part of that is simply because SSDs are far more reliable than spinning hard disks, but part of it too is that APFS seems more reliable than HFS+ ever was. HFS+ wasn&#39;t unreliable — and its reliability levelled up with the addition of journaling back in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-06">1</a></sup> — but APFS seems more reliable. When catastrophe does strike, the path to recovery is better than ever. In the old days, you&#39;d need to find a bootable system software DVD (or, going back in time, a CD, or a floppy...) or a bootable USB drive, and reinstall the OS from disk. In recent years, however, that&#39;s been replaced by the built-in <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="Apple Support: “Intro to macOS Recovery”">MacOS Recovery</a> system that lets you do things like run Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup, reinstall the entire OS from scratch, and more. No hunting around for a special CD/DVD or thumb drive (that Murphy&#39;s Law suggests you won&#39;t have handy when you suddenly find yourself needing one). Just long-press the power button on your Mac and boom — you&#39;re in Recovery mode.</p><p> I have no data to prove that APFS is more reliable than HFS+ was, so to check my gut feeling, I asked both John Siracusa (filesystem aficionado <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-06">2</a></sup> ) and Nanian (who works in the trenches of SuperDuper customer support). Both agreed that APFS is more reliable. Nanian further observed, though, that when things do go catastrophically wrong with an APFS disk now, it tends to be at a very low level — corruption at the container or volume level. And if Apple&#39;s own Disk Utility can&#39;t fix it, there aren&#39;t any third-party tools that can. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-06">3</a></sup> That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is, if the problem really is just with uncorrectable corruption (and <em>not</em> a hardware failure with the device), you can use Recovery to fully erase the drive and container, clean install the OS, and restore your data from your backup drive using Migration Assistant — and that will almost certainly work.</p><p> So in some sense, the argument goes, there&#39;s no need for bootable clones of a startup drive any more. Just clone your data, not your whole drive, to an external drive for backup purposes, and if something goes wrong with your startup volume:</p><ol><li> <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="Apple Support: “Intro to macOS Recovery”">Boot into Recovery</a> .</li><li> Try repairing the startup disk using Disk Utility from within Recovery. Hierarchically, you do this at the volume level first, then container level, then the device itself. A device encompasses containers, containers encompass volumes, and you should repair from the inside out. This support document from Apple, “ <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/repair-a-storage-device-dskutl1040/mac" title="Apple Support :“Repair a Storage Device in Disk Utility on Mac”">Repair a Storage Device in Disk Utility on Mac</a> ”, explains and illustrates the process.</li><li> If Disk Utility can&#39;t fix it, use Recovery to erase the disk, then install the OS.</li><li> During the first boot after the clean install, choose the option to “restore” (which is effectively like running Migration Assistant) and choose your external drive, with the backup clone of your previous startup volume, as the source. In other words, treat your restored Mac as though it&#39;s a brand-new Mac. (If you get to the point of creating a new, fresh user account, you&#39;ve gone too far.)</li></ol><p> The backup you use in step #3 above does not need to have MacOS installed on it, or, if it does have a bootable copy of MacOS, that version doesn&#39;t need to be the same version of MacOS that Recovery clean installed on the internal drive. In SuperDuper, you can just use “Backup - all files” with Smart Update, which clones everything in the writeable “Data” volume, but doesn&#39;t copy the OS from the read-only “System” (OS) volume (because it can&#39;t, for technical reasons you and I need not worry about — seriously, this stuff will take you <em>deep</em> into the weeds).</p><p> But let me try to speedrun through what I, as a SuperDuper user, want to know and understand. To make a clone of your internal startup drive to an external drive, you want to use “Backup - all files”. (SuperDuper&#39;s “Backup - user files” will only back up what&#39;s in user account home folders inside <code>/Users/</code> . That will include most of your personal files, but it won&#39;t include system-wide data that&#39;s shared between all users, such as applications you&#39;ve installed in the top-level <code>/Applications/</code> folder, or everything in <code>/Library/</code> . I&#39;m sure some people have a need for “Backup - user files”, but I don&#39;t. And it&#39;s worth pointing out that an external drive that contains cloned data from “Backup - user files” cannot serve as the source for Migration Assistant. That&#39;s a dealbreaker for me. The primary purpose of a SuperDuper backup, for me, is its ability to serve as the source for Migration Assistant, which, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs#fn2-2020-11-17">as I&#39;ve written previously</a> , is an astonishingly good and useful tool.)</p><p> When you run “Backup - all files”, you have the following options: <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-06">4</a></sup></p><ul><li> <em>Erase, then copy</em> — This completely erases the external destination volume before copying over the entire contents of your internal startup drive. This takes longer than Smart Update, but, importantly, “Erase, then copy” will clone the <em>entire</em> internal disk, including the read-only System volume containing MacOS. This should leave you with a <em>bootable</em> clone of your startup drive.</li><li> <em>Smart Update</em> — This does what you think a “smart” update would do. Instead of copying everything, every time, it just copies and erases what&#39;s necessary to make the Data volume on the destination disk identical to the Data volume on the source disk. If you start with a fresh, empty external drive as the destination, it has to copy everything, but after that, Smart Update runs will be faster. But the nature of how it works means that it can only clone the read/write Data volume of your startup drive. That means it won&#39;t copy the OS from the read-only System volume. No matter what else you do (which I&#39;m about to cover), that&#39;s OK, because the result of a Smart Update is an external drive containing all of your own files and installed apps, and, crucially, it&#39;s a disk that you can use as the source for Migration Assistant.</li></ul><p> So if you <em>always</em> use “Erase, then copy”, your SuperDuper external backups will always be bootable clones of your startup drive, with the same version of MacOS installed as your internal disk. The only downside to doing it this way is that backups take longer, because you&#39;re erasing the external drive and copying everything every time. (You don&#39;t have to supervise SuperDuper backups in any way, so how long they take doesn&#39;t really matter much.)</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Smart Update”, you won&#39;t have a bootable external drive (because the read-only System volume is never copied over), but you will have all your own files, and the external drive will work as a source for Migration Assistant.</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Erase, then copy” to create the initial backup clone, but <em>subsequently</em> use “Smart Update” for incremental backups, all of <em>your</em> data and installed apps will be updated on the external drive each time you back up. And the drive should remain a bootable backup — but the version of MacOS installed on the external drive will remain unchanged from the initial “Erase, then copy” backup. This is how I&#39;ve been running SuperDuper.</p><h2> Why Bootable Backup Drives Still Matter</h2><p> In the course of writing this article — which I&#39;ve been thinking about, and researching, on and off since December, when the MacOS 15.2 replicator bug broke SuperDuper&#39;s ability to create bootable backups — I&#39;ve shaken some of my own longstanding assumptions about my backup needs. I&#39;ve been making bootable clones with SuperDuper since whenever I started using it, which was over two decades ago. The earliest mention of SuperDuper on Daring Fireball is this post, explaining how I installed OS updates at the time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/12/software_update" title="Daring Fireball: “Software Update Tips and Voodoo”">from December 2004</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I use <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a> for cloning my entire startup drive.我强烈推荐它。</p></blockquote><p> Still true! I have no intention to stop making regular backups of my entire startup drive using SuperDuper. But: do I care anymore whether they&#39;re bootable? If you&#39;d asked me before December, I would have said yes, definitely.为什么？ Because, my thinking went, if something catastrophic happened to my internal startup drive, and I was working on something urgent, I&#39;d want to get back up and working again as soon as possible. Rather than wait for MacOS Recovery to reinstall the OS on the internal drive and then wait for Migration Assistant to copy my data from my external drive to the clean install of MacOS on the internal drive, I could just boot from the external backup drive and get back to work immediately.</p><p> I&#39;ve been lucky enough over my now many years as a Mac user to have suffered very few disk calamities like that. But I&#39;ve encountered them. And there have been situations when having an up-to-date bootable backup drive has been useful, if not crucial. But, upon reflection, I realize now that it&#39;s been many many years since the last time I even thought to boot from my backup drive. I used to even periodically test that the backup drive was, in fact, bootable, as a precaution. I haven&#39;t done that in years.</p><p> I mentioned above that for my regular backup cloning, I use SuperDuper&#39;s Smart Update, which leaves the read-only installation of MacOS on the backup drive unchanged. I just checked today and while my MacBook Pro is running the current version of MacOS (15.3 Sequoia), the version on my cloned backup drive was 12.6.1 Monterey, which was released in October 2022. (That&#39;s the last time I did a full “Erase, then copy” backup in SuperDuper.) That effectively means my backup drive <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been bootable, or at least not <em>usefully</em> bootable. For example, all my email files are in the mailbox format expected by Apple Mail in MacOS 15.3; I doubt that Apple Mail from MacOS 12.6 can read those mailbox files. The same is probably true for just about every app — or at least every system app from Apple — that I use. Surely <em>some</em> software from MacOS 12.6 can&#39;t read the files or settings from the software from MacOS 15.3, and I&#39;ll bet a lot of it can&#39;t. New software can often recognize old file formats generated by older versions of the software; old software can&#39;t recognize new file formats that were introduced after the old software was written.</p><p> What you should do, if you really want bootable startup drive backups via SuperDuper, is use “Erase, then copy” after every MacOS software update. Or just use “Erase, then copy” every time. But the fact that I wasn&#39;t doing this for the last two years doesn&#39;t mean my cloned backup drive has been useless. It just means it&#39;s only been useful for restoring backed-up data, not for booting my Mac. Which, when I think about it, is how I would have used it if I had needed to. I don&#39;t work in a fast-paced production environment with tight deadlines. I think MacBooks really only run properly when booting from their internal drives, anyway. If something ever goes wrong with mine, I&#39;ll try using Disk Utility to repair it, and if that fails, I&#39;ll turn to MacOS Recovery to clean install the OS and then use Migration Assistant to copy my data back from my external backup驾驶。</p><p> Thinking about it, booting from an old version of MacOS on an external backup drive containing data from the current version of MacOS sounds like a good way to corrupt some of the files on that disk — subverting the entire purpose of a backup. (Most likely, if you try this, the Mac will simply fail to boot.) It&#39;s reckless to boot from and “use” a backup drive for production when the source drive that it&#39;s a clone of has failed — at that point, your backup drive is likely your only local copy of the data from that failed drive. It really only ought to be treated as a read-only source for restoration. And the way Macs are designed to work today, with MacOS Recovery and Migration Assistant, makes that pretty easy.</p><p> The last time I had a catastrophic problem with my startup drive was in 2010, and I wrote about how I recovered, gracefully and with no drama (nor, seemingly, an iota of lost data), in a piece I titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox">An Ode to DiskWarrior, SuperDuper, and Dropbox</a> ”. More of my digital life is in the cloud — and thus replicated in at least one place other than my Mac&#39;s startup drive — now than then. Off the top of my head, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of anything I do on my Mac that isn&#39;t synced to cloud storage via Dropbox, iCloud, or IMAP. Starting in 2014 I&#39;ve also been a customer of <a href="https://backblaze.com/thetalkshow">Backblaze</a> , a set-it-and-forget-it online backup service (that, for many years, has been a regular sponsor of this site and The Talk Show, but I recommend it because it&#39;s good, not because they have been and might someday again be a sponsor). That&#39;s <em>another</em> copy of all my personal data backed up somewhere. <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-06">5</a></sup></p><p> Having my SuperDuper-cloned backup drive be bootable is nice to have, but I really can&#39;t say I <em>need</em> it any more. 20, 15, even just 10 years ago, that wasn&#39;t true — I really did want the ability to boot from my backup drive at a moment&#39;s notice. But that&#39;s really not true any more for me. It probably isn&#39;t for you, either. It definitely isn&#39;t true for most Mac users.</p><p> But it remains true for <em>some</em> people, who are using (or responsible for) Macs in high-pressure tight-deadline production environments. Live broadcast studios. Magazines or newspapers with a deadline for the printer that&#39;s just hours (or minutes) away. Places with strict security/privacy rules that forbid cloud storage of certain critical files. If the startup drive on a production machine fails, they need to get up and running <em>now</em> . Plug in a backup drive, restart, and go. Anything longer than that is unacceptable.</p><p>那不是我。 That&#39;s probably not you. But there are a lot of people whose work environment that describes. For as much as Apple Silicon Macs have become iOS-like devices in many ways, they&#39;re still Macs at heart: workstations. There remain people inside Apple who know that, too.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-06"><p> Fun fact gleaned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">the Wikipedia entry for HFS Plus</a> : “Codenamed <em>Sequoia</em> in development, HFS+ was introduced with the January 19, 1998, release of Mac OS 8.1.” I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s further proof that Apple has a penchant for reusing old code names, or if code-name reuse is simply inevitable for a nearly 49-year-old company that&#39;s always been chockablock with secret projects. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-06"><p><em>丁。</em> <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-06"><p> One of the ways that APFS is very “modern Apple” is that it&#39;s largely a black box.

It&#39;s surprising that any of it survived. As a kid/teen in the &#39;80s, everything of mine existed only on floppy disks.即使是最小的容量硬盘驱动器也很昂贵。 Apple&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Disk_20">Hard Disk 20</a> was a 20 megabyte external drive that cost $1,500 when it debuted in 1985, which is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">about $4,400</a> in today&#39;s dollars.那是一吨钱。 But the floppy disks of the time were just 400 KB — a Hard Disk 20 gave you the storage of 50 of them.但是，对于孩子来说，即使是软盘也很昂贵。 We&#39;d fill them up faster than we could buy them, and we&#39;d re-use the same floppies over and over when we needed a “new” one — often begrudgingly erasing whatever was previously on the old one.这对于存储介质上的数据完整性并不理想，以至于它暴露在空气中。 In the &#39;90s we all had hard drives, but those hard drives were always almost full.我们不断地将文件从硬盘驱动器中复制到软盘中以进行“存储”，以创建一些自由空间。当出现<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive">拉链磁盘</a>时，感觉就像是“超级软盘”，每个磁盘都包含100 MB。 We lived our digital lives one catastrophic hard drive failure away from losing almost all of our files, and the hard drives of that era were, by today&#39;s standards, flaky as hell. (If you heard your hard drive start to <em>click</em> , you panicked, and immediately began copying your most important files to another disk or disks.)</p><p> My grandparents&#39; generation lived through the Great Depression, and they wound up with, to my generation&#39;s eyes, very odd ideas about the availability and abundance of food. Many of the people who grew up in an era when food was profoundly scarce, wound up treating food as a scarcity for the remainder of their lives. They ate whatever was on their plate, whether they enjoyed it or not, and they were offended by anyone who didn&#39;t.</p><p> It&#39;s clear to me that I came of age during an era of computing when storage was both scarce and unreliable. I like to think that I&#39;ve adapted with the times, especially given what I do for a living. I <em>know</em> how different storage is today — abundant, cheap, reliable — but I still have <em>feelings</em> about my data that are rooted in the distant past. <a href="#fnr5-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★可启动的Mac启动驱动器备份，另一种是Superduper</title></entry><entry><title> Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple&#39;s App Store </title><link href="https://x.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1886649436685693082" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w26" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41550</id><published> 2025-02-05T00:02:45Z</published><updated> 2025-02-06T22:48:15Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, on X:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is being extremely disingenuous in attacking the European Union here. The iOS App Store hosts the Reddit app, which provides access to massive amounts of porn. Apple knows this, permits it, and gave Reddit a 17+ (!!!) rating and Editors Choice award. [...]</p><p> As a recently deleted (by who?) post on the r/iOS subreddit explains, Apple&#39;s iOS App Store welcomes apps that host tons of porn, as Reddit does, as long as the majority of the content isn&#39;t porn, and the app has controls to hide the porn.</p></blockquote><p> Sweeney has a real point here, and it really is a bit of a conundrum. I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s alluding to with the “by who?” parenthetical, but I don&#39;t think one deleted Reddit thread on the topic was the result of Apple dispatching some Men in Black agents to knock on Reddit&#39;s door. Reddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/mt4l64/why_can_ios_apps_like_reddit_and_twitter_host/">full</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l03kt7/why_is_the_reddit_app_still_in_the_app_stores/">non-deleted</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/seu2zx/why_does_apple_ban_from_the_appstore_apps_like/">threads</a> from people asking variations of the same question. And the press has been covering the saga <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/reddit-ios-apps-disappear-nsfw-content/">for a decade</a> .</p><p> But how is it possible that these super popular platforms have apps in the no-porn App Store while hosting tons of porn? It&#39;s an issue with Reddit, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tumblr-adds-sensitive-content-filter-to-ios-app">with Tumblr</a> ( <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">times</a> ), and apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/04/x-twitter-porn-policy-under-18-opt-in">especially so with X</a> (fka Twitter). (I&#39;m not trying to feign prudishness here, but I&#39;ve heard, several times, that you really <em>don&#39;t</em> want to go looking for NSFW content on X because what you&#39;ll find is ... something.)</p><p> I think Sweeney&#39;s synopsis captures Apple&#39;s de facto policy accurately, with the exception that they don&#39;t <em>welcome</em> apps that host porn (so long as the app has controls to hide it, and if the adult content is effectively a side hustle in the overall context of the app), but <em>tolerate</em> it. It&#39;s a de facto policy of tolerating unadvertised pornographic content on platforms that are too big to ban from the App Store without generating far more of an outcry than any controversy over the side-hustle porn will.</p><p> Some banks are too big to fail. Some platforms are too big to ban. Apple won&#39;t say that, but that&#39;s clearly the tacit policy. It&#39;s not confusing that the exceptions are super popular apps — they are exceptions <em>because</em> they&#39;re super popular. And it&#39;s absolutely not a policy of looking the other way — Apple&#39;s policing of the situation is an enormous never-ending pain in the ass for the platforms involved. To see NSFW content in the iOS Reddit app, for example, you need to be signed in, <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061032831-How-do-I-view-NSFW-communities">and enable an off-by-default setting</a> . <a href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/potentially-mature-content/">Tumblr does similar</a> . You can&#39;t just download the Reddit or Tumblr apps from the App Store and innocuously find yourself viewing pornography.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple’s App Store’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> AltStore PAL Is Free of Charge, Thanks to &#39;MegaGrant&#39; From Epic Games </title><link href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w25" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/altstore-pal-epic" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41549</id><published> 2025-02-04T23:23:51Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T23:23:52Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
