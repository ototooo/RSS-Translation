<p>我过去六天使用了iPhone 16e，经验是一种回报。从许多方面来说，iPhone 16e看起来和感觉就像史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）时代iPhone的现代后代。诸如塑料3G和3GS以及玻璃背面/金属侧4和4s之类的早期iPhone更简单。两种颜色，黑白。单镜头不起眼的相机。 iPhone 16e感觉就像他们的后代。</p><p>让我们从相机开始。 iPhone 16E相机仅在背面只有一个镜头，与双镜头和三镜弟兄相比，iPhone 16e相机<em>看起来</em>不太明显，<em>而且感觉</em>不太明显。尤其是对我来说，来自日常驾驶iPhone Pro模型的几年，手动和口袋的感觉较小，因为它缺少iPhone 16和16 Pro Camera镜头本身的整个“ Mesa”突出。</p><p>苹果针对iPhone厚度的技术规格不包括相机镜头或相机台面。苹果只是测量并报告手机平坦非摄像机部分的厚度。但是那些相机模块和镜头伸出了很多。使用数字卡钳，我测量了16e，常规16和16 Pro的三个“级别”的厚度：</p><p><table class="table-1C94D92B-727A-4CC3-8A3B-18EA7E38C1D7" width = 350><style>

  /></a></p><p> iPhone 16e看起来像是一部手机，背面带有微型相机。 iPhone 16 Pro看起来像是一部恰好是手机的相机。您也确实可以感觉到手头上的差异 - 不仅是体重，而且平衡。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-26">1</a></sup>您可以感觉到16个Pro的额外相机硬件增加了额外的重量。根据苹果的规格，iPhone 16e重167克； 16 Pro 199g  - 差异16％。 （还要注意一个聪明的触摸：苹果的每个手机的默认壁纸，巧妙地表明它们拥有多少个相机镜头。）</p><p> 16e相机镜头并没有与手机的背面冲洗，但是它很少（按我的尺寸为1.7毫米）突出，以至于它可以回到iPhone摄像头<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">刚开始从手机后面伸出的</a>时候。 16e在桌面上放置时仍会摆动，但比常规iPhone 16或尤其是iPhone 16 Pro的摄像机模块显得差不多。但是16e的1.7毫米相机镜头的突出是如此之最小，以至于当下手机时，手机<em>确实</em>完全平放在桌子上，因为盒子不需要保护镜头，因为16e相机镜头的镜头比案件的厚度小。 （苹果在<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD3P4ZM/A/iphone-16e-silicone-case-white">39美元的硅胶盒</a>中包括我的评论套件中的两个，蓝色和黑色。它们很好，感觉就像苹果的通常有机硅盒一样。）</p><p>由于最近的常规和Pro iPhone型号上的“宏”模式使用了0.5×Ultrawide摄像头，因此16E没有次级镜头，因此16E没有宏模式。<a href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-macro-camera-a-big-day-for-small-things/">从iPhone 13 Pro开始</a>，宏模式使iPhone Pros可以专注于小于一英寸的物体。但是，由于16e的1倍相机的传感器比更昂贵的iPhone型号上的1×相机具有较小的传感器和较小的镜头，因此它能够以较短的距离进行焦点，而不是那些更大，更好的1×相机。 iPhone 16 Pro上的1倍摄像头的最小聚焦距离为24厘米（〜9.5英寸）。 iPhone 16e上的1×相机的最小聚焦距离为12厘米（〜4.75英寸）。实际的宏模式（在常规iPhone和Pro iPhone型号上）更好，但是当16e的孤独相机可以在常规拍摄模式下，只需4英寸以上的距离，就不需要太多。</p><p>当然，16e的不起眼的相机具有价格：图像质量。您确实可以看到弱光的差异。 16E相机的速度较慢（导致具有运动中的受试者的模糊图像），并且图像更嘈杂。当<a href="https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">卤化物中的过程为零时，在</a>低光中拍摄时，差异尤其明显。不过，这是一个很好的相机，出于刻痕目的。对于大多数可能正在考虑使用iPhone 16e的人，它可能是他们拥有的最好的相机。而且，只有一个镜头的简单性，提供1×和2倍的视野，就有话要说。如果您知道什么是ƒ停车，则可能不应该购买iPhone 16e。如果您不知道什么是ƒ停车，则可能不会注意到iPhone 16甚至16 Pro的相机质量有任何差异。对于只想要一个体面的相机的任何人来说，这是一个完美的相机。</p><h2>缺少的是：magsafe，晋升和超宽带（以及，其他超宽带）</h2><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16-pro,iphone-16,iphone-16e">仔细阅读Apple的比较页面</a>，将16E与16个Pro和常规16进行比较，您会发现数十个小差异。但是，一个遗漏吸引了最大的关注（并产生了最“ WTF Apple？”反应）是Magsafe。我拥有一堆Magsafe外围设备，而没有它，个人就不会购买iPhone。我的桌子上有<a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-carbide">一个码头</a>（<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-standby-iph878d77632/ios">备用模式</a>很棒），<a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger">床头柜上的充电器</a>，以及像<a href="https://www.moft.us/products/case-stand-wallet-snap-set?variant=39411246989399">这种磁性折叠台</a>这样的方便的doodads。使用16e作为我的主要手机的一周，我仍然像第一天晚上一样想念Magsafe。</p><p>但是据苹果代表称，16e目标受众中的大多数人专门将手机插入充电电缆中。他们倾向于根本不使用电感充电，而当他们这样做时，他们可能不在乎16e被pokey 7.5W QI充电速度粘住，而最近更昂贵的iPhone在15W甚至25W时通过Magsafe充电。对我来说，这不是我最想念的高充电速度。这是捕获的位置。 <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-26">2</a></sup>我认为苹果比我更了解16e的预期受众。大胆的火球读者不在16e人群中；是DF读者的朋友和家人。</p><p>典型的低端iPhone买家关心哪些功能？他们想要一部看起来不错的手机，具有良好的显示屏，不错的相机和较长的电池寿命。他们是否在乎16e仅支持Wi-Fi 6，而不是7？不，因为他们的想法为零，Wi-Fi版本号甚至是什么意思。他们只是认为Wi-Fi是Wi-Fi。他们是否关心Verizon（又称“ Ultra宽带”）的SuperSpeed MMWave 5G网络？不。他们只是希望他们的细胞连接快速而牢固。 （我来自Apple的评论单位在AT＆T蜂窝连接上暂时持续了良好的ESIM。整个星期，我唯一注意到一个较弱的信号是在一个深处的郊区 /边界乡村地区，而周末拜访家人；我妻子的iPhone 15 Pro Max在同​​一位置的Verizon上失去了信号。我对Apple的C1 C1调制仪的投诉。）</p><p> iPhone 16E还省略了<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109021"><em>另一个</em>“超宽带”</a> ，这是苹果用于精确位置检测的芯片 - 例如跟踪AirPod到一英尺内。精确发现非常酷，当您真正被诸如钥匙扣之类的丢失物品​​所困扰时，非常有帮助。自2019年iPhone 11以来，除了SE（现在是16E）以外的所有新iPhone（现在是16e），Ultra Gidband已包含在所有新的iPhone中。从书呆子的角度来看，五年后的16E确实确实是一个奇怪的遗漏。但是，您的大家庭中有多少人知道“超宽带精确发现”是什么？</p><p>迄今为止，只有Apple的iPhone Pro模型才支持促销 -  Apple的营销名称具有自适应刷新率，最高为120 Hz且可在“始终处”显示模式下达到1 Hz。鉴于常规的iPhone 16（和16 Plus）不支持促销，因此16e的机会为零。有具有高率速率显示器的中端Android手机，但是（a）我认为它们没有<em>更好的</em>显示器，考虑到所有内容，并且（b）它们是中端Android手机。这就像吹嘘起亚Sorento中仪表板显示器上的刷新率。 16e显示器还具有一个倒退的档次，代替了更典型，更有趣，有时巧妙的动态岛屿。</p><p> iPhone 16e的目标是“我只关心基础知识” iPhone买家：屏幕看起来不错，相机很好，但简单，电池持续很长时间（对于从四岁或五岁的iPhone升级的任何人来说，差异都非常明显），它运行了所有现有的应用程序，并且在插入USB电缆时会快速充电。这些是基础知识，基础知识都是休闲用户关心的。由于其最小突出的单相机镜头，它的重量较轻，体重较小。</p><h2>定价</h2><p>16e获得的讨论的唯一方面比其遗漏MagSafe的讨论更多的是其128 GB基本型号的起价为600美元。有些人说：“这应该少$ 100”，他们往往是同一个人，他们<em>也</em>强烈认为应该包括Magsafe和促销展示。这是苹果当前的iPhone阵容，加上已停产（但<a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022.html?q=iphone%20se">仍然</a>可以从<a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/prepaid-phones/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022-64gb-midnight">某些</a>承运人那里<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-se-3rd-generation-64gb-unlocked-black/6507470.p?skuId=6507470">获得</a>）3rd Generation SE： </p><table class="table-7940E2A4-0011-4258-A4DA-D506F80A4F67" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

<p><a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie">查理</a>·<a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute">梦露</a>（Charlie Monroe）</p><blockquote><p>但也不要一个人这样做。我一年365天工作。去年，我工作了366天（2024年是leap年）。我并不是说我每天工作8个小时，但是即使在周末，假期，假期，我也需要在一个小时左右的早晨支持电子邮件，然后在下午或晚上再次支持电子邮件。我不能仅仅起飞并离开几天，而没有看到后果并回来时发疯。目前，我每天收到大约100份报告。有些是关于许可代码问题的，有些是崩溃报告，有些是订购的转换问题，有些是唐尼下载问题，但这全部总计每天的100个报告中的平均值。</p><p>如果我要去度假10天……您要做数学，我会回到什么。再加上您的用户不想等待10天。甚至5天。有些用户不愿意等待一个小时，而只是没有意识到您每天24小时不能在计算机上，并且您可能在不同的时区和睡觉。不幸的是，在我的情况下，通过支持电子邮件，每天大约需要2-3个小时 - 这不足以雇用某人并训练他们。更不用说大多数报告实际上都需要一些技术知识。因此，除非我聘请另一个开发人员，否则最终，某人可以做的真正的管理工作是每天30分钟的工作。</p></blockquote><p>我不建议您永远不要为任何人休息一下，但是在某些公司中，<em>有人</em>需要每天花一个小时以上的时间。如果您是一个人的手术，那个人即使在度假时也是如此。没有人参与独立发展，因为他们也期待提供支持。这是驱动它们的应用程序的设计，编程，制作和精炼。但这就像在某些方面成为音乐家或喜剧演员一样。对于那些努力，磨练正在从一个城市到另一个城市进行演出。或像在<em>熊</em>上戏剧化的餐厅一样 - 准备工作，清洁，采购，预订，食物过敏，更清洁。它永远不会停止。对于独立开发人员而言，磨削是支持。 （小餐厅通常每周关闭一两天；技术支持电子邮件地址不会。）当专业艺术家成为专业艺术家时，总是有很多琐碎的工作。但这也是为什么如此众多的独立开发人员（似乎是梦露）认为值得的努力。因为艺术作品非常充实。</p><p>前一段时间 - 大约20年前，在Mac OS X的独立开发中“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol">美味</a>”<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/27/siracusa-delicous-library">文艺复兴时期</a>的高峰期 - 有一个开发人员以一个值得非常受欢迎的应用程序突然出现。它是华丽而快速的。它的功能比其人满为患的类别中的其他应用程序少得多，但这也是该应用程序吸引力的一部分。这就像一个运动型的小跑车，其中包括实用的轿车和卡车。他最终推出了第二个应用程序，这也很受欢迎。我说，从美学上讲，他的应用有点像恐慌。他们不仅看上去很酷，而且从可用性的角度进行了精心设计。因此，我已经被告知，这个开发人员几乎没有时间在客户的技术支持方面。我的一个朋友问他怎么可能。这个开发人员说，很容易。当收件箱的支持电子邮件看起来很饱时，他会选择全部选择，然后删除。收件箱零。</p><p>这个故事一直让我发笑。从某种意义上说，这很有趣。但是最终，这表明他只是没有为独立应用程序业务削减。我认为他的应用程序在2010年左右处于休眠状态并不是一个巧合，而且我没有听说过他或从15年中听说过他。他很有才华，所以如果他在其他一些业务中做得很好，也许是在一家更大的公司内部做得很好，我不会感到惊讶，那里的开发人员和设计师与客户隔离开来，而不是像印度本质上那样与他们陷入困境。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“查理·梦露：“关于独立应用业务的几句话”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Xai的Grok-3跳到AI排行榜的顶部</title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/617780/grok-3-elon-musk-ai-race-chatgpt" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/grok-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41611</id><published> 2025-02-26T19：32：29Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T23：09：32Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes against the measure.</p></blockquote><p> President Trump, at 8am this morning, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114070315739588346">on his own very popular social network</a> :</p><blockquote><p>苹果应该摆脱DEI规则，而不仅仅是对它们进行调整。 Dei是一个骗局，对我国非常有害。 Dei走了！！！</p></blockquote><p> Needless to say, the National Center for Public Policy Research is a bunch of ding-dongs, and Trump has no idea, at all, what <a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/">Apple&#39;s actual policies and goals are for diversity</a> — he just knows he wants them gone. (And I love the photo MacRumors&#39;s Joe Rossignol chose <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/trump-on-apple-diversity-policies/">for his report on this story</a> .)</p><p> There does exist a formal world of DEI, right down to using that very acronym. Think of it as <em>DEI™</em> . Some <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/how-is-dei-going-at-the-university-of-michigan/">universities seem overrun with it</a> , despite results that <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/does-dei-even-work/">strongly suggest it doesn&#39;t work</a> and <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/university-dei-statements-are-a-demeaning-charade/">some clearly objectionable dogmatic requirements</a> . But there are obvious reasons any company (or university, or organization) ought to be concerned about diversity and inclusion, in the plain sense of those words. Not just ethical “ <em>the way things ought to be</em> ” reasons, but <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">empirical studies have shown</a> that diverse organizations are more successful.</p><p> It&#39;s a spectrum. A lot of US universities are at the far left of that spectrum. The Trump administration and its proponents are, clearly, at the far right of that spectrum, where they&#39;re seeking now to pressure companies into not even concerning themselves with “diversity” in the plainest sense of the word, and are scrubbing from government agencies words like “woman” and “disabled”. I&#39;m being overly simplistic by presenting the left/right divide as unidimensional here. Trump, for example, has ushered in a very different “right” than that of, say, the Bush-Cheney era 20 years ago. But the DEI™ “left” is a very different left than <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/cancel-culture-illiberalism-dead/681031/">the truly liberal free-speech left</a> . Liberals object to DEI&#39;s rigidity, dogma, and performative nature; Trump and his cohorts object to actual human diversity and inclusiveness.</p><p> Some big corporations, in recent years, veered pretty far to the extreme on “DEI initiatives”, and are using the current political moment <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lowes-dei-harley-davidson-john-deere-tractor-supply/">to course correct back toward</a> the (to me, sensible) center. But this course correction started long before Trump&#39;s re-election. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html">a CNBC story from December 2023</a> on Google and Meta scaling back formal DEI programs.</p><p> Apple, from my observations, has long charted its own consistent course on such matters, right down to calling their policies “Inclusion &amp; Diversity” rather than the name-brand “DEI”. Apple didn&#39;t lunge to the left at the height of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, because they didn&#39;t need to.因此，他们现在不需要纠正。 Apple shareholders seemingly agree.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Shareholders Resoundingly Reject Proposal to Ditch the Company’s ‘Inclusion and Diversity’ Policies; Trump Responds With His Usual Equanimity’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/apple-shareholders-reject-proposl-to-ditch-diversity-policies">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Yours Truly With Rene Ritchie Talking About the iPhone 16e</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5OdiEzJNgk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/25/rene-ritchie-iphone-16e" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41607</id><published> 2025-02-25T22:55:12Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T22:55:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mike Allen, writing for Axios, under the headline “Trump Manufacturing Win: Apple to Spend $500 Billion in US, Hire 20,000”:</p><blockquote><p> Trump met with Cook on Thursday in the Oval Office. Then Trump got so excited that he revealed the plans prematurely, saying on-camera while meeting with governors that Cook is “investing hundreds of billions of dollars. I hope he&#39;s announced it — I hope I didn&#39;t announce it, but what the hell? All I do is tell the truth — that&#39;s what he told me. Now he has to do it, right?”</p><p> “He is investing hundreds of billions of dollars and others, too,” Trump continued. “We will have a lot of chipmakers coming in, a lot of automakers coming in. They stopped two plants in Mexico that were ... starting construction. They just stopped them — they&#39;re going to build them here instead, because they don&#39;t want to pay the tariffs. Tariffs are amazing.”</p></blockquote><p> Apple and Tim Cook, I&#39;m sure, are pleased as pie to have today&#39;s announcement portrayed this way, as a “Trump manufacturing win”, despite the fact that it&#39;s seemingly exactly in line with the trajectory Apple&#39;s been on for US job creation since 2018, including a nearly identical announcement <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">in 2021</a> (that they largely, but <a href="https://abc11.com/post/apple-nc-east-coast-hub-on-hold-research-triangle-park-3-years-later-1-billion-project/14997218/">not entirely</a> , followed through on).</p><p> The Mexico angle rings weird to my ears, though. Bloomberg picked up on that too, running a headline over the weekend that read “ <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tim-cook-meeting-trump-220006653.html">Trump Says Cook Shifting Apple Manufacturing From Mexico to US</a> ”.</p><p> The last thing I remember Apple having assembled in Mexico were a small number of late model Apple Extended Keyboard II&#39;s in 1995 (which were <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">inferior to their American-made models</a> , like the one I&#39;m using to write this). It&#39;s quite possible I&#39;m overlooking some Mexican-made Apple products in the intervening decades, but if there are any, they&#39;re not recent. So I suspect Tim Cook, in his meeting with Trump last week, sold him a bill of goods, and more or less convinced Trump that Apple <em>had</em> been planning to commission some new plants in Mexico (a country so loathsome <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco">Trump confiscated their gulf</a> ) but, thanks to President Trump&#39;s inspiring leadership, Apple would instead be building those plants right here in the US, in the big old red state of Texas — when in fact all of this is pretty much exactly what Apple had been planning to do all along.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Mission Accomplished: Trump Likes Apple’s Plan, Especially the Part About Mexico That I Don’t Think Was Real’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/mission-accomplished">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Announces Plan to Spend More Than $500 Billion in the US Over the Next Four Years (Which Is Probably Exactly What They&#39;ve Been Planning to Do) </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41603</id><published> 2025-02-24T20:23:36Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T01:43:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced its largest-ever spend commitment, with plans to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years.</p></blockquote><p> The context of making a big deal over this announcement, of course, is that Apple is seeking exemptions from the Trump administration&#39;s tariffs. $500 billion is a lot of money, even for Apple, and 20,000 new jobs over the next four years is a lot of jobs, especially at a time when many big tech companies are laying off, not hiring. (The federal government is trying to lay off a lot of employees too, if you haven&#39;t heard.) But <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-earmarks-500-billion-for-u-s-expansion-19ca11a0">as the WSJ notes in their story on this announcement</a> , those 20,000 new jobs are a continuation of their existing hiring growth: “The company, which had 164,000 full-time equivalent employees as of September, has added an average of 5,400 annually over the past five years.”</p><p> Apple announced a similar plan four years ago — $430 billion and 20,000 jobs. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">In the announcement of that 2021 plan, Apple said</a> , “Over the past three years, Apple&#39;s contributions in the US have significantly outpaced the company&#39;s original five-year goal of $350 billion set in 2018.”</p><p> So I don&#39;t think this announcement is bullshit, at all. But I also don&#39;t think <em>what</em> Apple has announced today is much, if any, different from what they&#39;d be doing if Kamala Harris had gotten 1–2 percent more of the vote in a handful of states in November. The difference is that everyone is looking for quid pro quo with President Transactional back in office.</p><p> Apple again:</p><blockquote><p> As part of its new US investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.</p><p> Previously manufactured outside the US, the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&amp;D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.</p></blockquote><p> Kind of interesting that the big manufacturing news is a product that Apple doesn&#39;t even sell, but produces only for its own use. I don&#39;t <em>think</em> this is a hint that they might begin selling servers ( <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/05/apple-discontinues-xserve-only-available-until-january-31st/">again</a> ), but who knows? I also wonder whether there&#39;s a corporate-espionage security angle to assembling these servers here, rather than in China.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces Plan to Spend More Than $500 Billion in the U.S. Over the Next Four Years (Which Is Probably Exactly What They’ve Been Planning to Do)’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> HP Added a 15-Minute Waiting Time for Telephone Support Calls </title><link href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/20/hp_deliberately_adds_15_minutes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41602</id><published> 2025-02-24T17:59:57Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T18:49:42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Paul Kunert, reporting for The Register last week:</p><blockquote><p> HP Inc is trying to force consumer PC and print customers to use online and other digital support channels by setting a minimum 15-minute wait time for anyone that phones the call center to get answers to troublesome queries. The wait time was added on Tuesday, February 18, according to internal communications seen by The Register, and impacts retail patrons in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, though we anticipate more countries could be added.</p><p> On the fifth, tenth, and thirteenth minute, the recorded message will tell HP customers it is “experiencing longer waiting times and we apologize for the inconvenience,” and again remind them they may switch to alternatives.</p></blockquote><p> Three days later, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/21/hp_ditches_15_minute_wait_time_call_centers/">HP reversed the new policy</a> , issuing this bullshit statement:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re always looking for ways to improve our customer service experience. This support offering was intended to provide more digital options with the goal of reducing time to resolve inquiries.</p><p> We have found that many of our customers were not aware of the digital support options we provide. Based on initial feedback, we know the importance of speaking to live customer service agents in a timely fashion is paramount. As a result, we will continue to prioritize timely access to live phone support to ensure we are delivering an exceptional customer experience.</p></blockquote><p> There&#39;s spin, and then there&#39;s just bald-faced lying. This clearly had nothing to do with improving customer support and was simply about cost. HP so wanted to discourage customers from using phone support to reach a real person for help that they instituted a 15-minute penalty timeout to discourage people from waiting.</p><p> There&#39;s some kind of joke to be made here about this literally inhumane approach to customer support being unveiled in the same week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane">HP announced its acquisition of Humane</a> — the company that turned its $1,000 AI Pins into bricks.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘HP Added a 15-Minute Waiting Time for Telephone Support Calls’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sigma BF</title><link href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/bf/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41601</id><published> 2025-02-24T17:46:46Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T17:46:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Absolutely beautiful new camera from Sigma. Full-size sensor, interchangeable lens system, but it&#39;s the camera design that jumps out:</p><blockquote><p> The Sigma BF represents a new, more intuitive way to use a camera. It is streamlined to make the act of photography as effortless as possible. We have replaced the shooting mode dial — itself a holdover from the days of film photography — with direct access to the five elements that decide the photograph. Shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode are all immediately available at the touch of a finger. The new Status Monitor displays the currently active setting, so the screen provides an unobstructed view of the subject.</p><p> The BF&#39;s high-resolution screen provides a distraction-free view of all necessary information — and nothing more. With one simple setting, it shows only the live view image, with the five key elements — shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode — displayed when you are ready to press the shutter button. All other options and settings are accessed via just three simple menu screens.</p></blockquote><p> This camera immediately struck lust in my heart. So many fewer dials and buttons, it&#39;s striking. They even got rid of storage cards — 230 GB of internal storage instead. $2000 (sans any lenses).</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Sigma BF’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Linus Sebastian&#39;s Thoughts After Switching to an iPhone for 30 Days </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41600</id><published> 2025-02-23T23:14:25Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T19:04:13Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I&#39;ve been meaning, since it came out in December, to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">this video from Linus Sebastian</a> of “Linus Tech Tips” fame, and with the iPhone 16e dropping this week, now seems like a good time. It&#39;s a common genre that dates back decades before YouTube was even a thing: longtime user of platform X switches to rival platform Y for a few weeks, and then explains what they liked, what they didn&#39;t, what confused them, etc. This sort of thing always raises hackles because there&#39;s a natural human tendency to get tribal — if not downright religious — about one&#39;s platforms of choice. And Sebastian&#39;s intro — playing to YouTube&#39;s algorithm — frames it in a way that makes it seem like his overall take on iOS is going to be inflammatory. Right in the first 30 seconds of the 20-minute video, he says:</p><blockquote><p> Just a few days into my iOS challenge I started to look a little differently at the Apple users in my life. They describe Apple products with marketing slogans like “it just works” as though they actually believe them, and it made me wonder, does Apple have one version of their products for the True Believers and then a different one for the scrubs like me? Because my time with the iPhone 16 Plus has been absolutely riddled with unintuitive design choices, unnecessarily limited functionality, and some of the weirdest bugs that I have encountered on a supposedly finished product in years.</p></blockquote><p> The first time I watched the video, my finger started hovering to the close-tab button at this point. But that provocative opening isn&#39;t really representative of Sebastian&#39;s actual observations and complaints at all. It&#39;s just the YouTube/social-media style.我？ I would start an essay, on, say, the things that bug me the most about Android, in the least inflammatory way possible, to open people&#39;s minds and get as many Android proponents as possible to relax, and listen to my arguments. And then I&#39;d try to make my case, building to a crescendo where I deliver my perhaps inflammatory conclusions only at the very end. YouTube works the reverse way — you start out in provocative fashion to raise hackles, because outrage drives engagement, but then sort of work your way back toward reasonableness.</p><p> Sebastian is a long-time Android user, but he&#39;s not really a phone guy at all. He doesn&#39;t review phones, typically. His own personal Android phone is several years old. His interest and renown is entirely in the field of PCs. So his video isn&#39;t really “ <em>Android power user reviews iOS</em> ”, but more like “ <em>PC power user who is also an Android user tries an iPhone for a month</em> ”.</p><p> I like these sort of videos because I&#39;m all-in on iOS at this point. I&#39;ve kept an Android phone at my desk since the Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One">Nexus One</a> in 2010, but the one still at my desk is a five-year-old Pixel 4. I feel more out of touch with the state-of-the-art on Android than ever. So a video like this, from the perspective of someone who is himself way out of date with the state-of-the-art on the iPhone side of the fence, is really interesting.</p><p> Sebastian winds up making a bunch of astute critiques of iOS and the iPhone experience. None of them were new to me, and none of them really left me with any sense of missing out by not being part of Team Android. But most of his complaints are completely legit — and a lot of them are things Apple should address. He complains repeatedly about iOS&#39;s animated transitions making everything feel slow. That&#39;s 100 percent true. As an everyday iPhone user I&#39;m just completely used to that. But those animations really do make iPhones feel slower than they are. In terms of tech specs iPhones are literally the fastest phones on the planet. Apple&#39;s A-series silicon is, and always has been, years ahead of the best silicon money can buy in an Android handset. But a lot of aspects of iOS <em>feel</em> slower than Android because of animated transitions which iOS (nor iPadOS) offers no option to speed up.它应该。 And the Accessibility setting to completely turn off animations doesn&#39;t solve the problem; what I want, and I think what Sebastian wants, is <em>faster</em> animations. (Sebastian also justifiably complains about the fact that so many useful iOS settings are buried under Accessibility. Many of the settings in Accessibility are related to accessibility, but a lot of them would be better found in an “Advanced” section of Settings that doesn&#39;t exist.)</p><p> Sebastian also correctly skewers iOS for its confusing audio volume settings; Android definitely wins here. Rearranging home screen icons sucks on iOS. CarPlay has annoying bugs. His fresh eyes were annoyed by something mine just accept: that Apple&#39;s first-party apps tend to put their preference settings in the Settings app, but third-party apps tend to keep them in-app. (But now Apple is starting to do that too, with new apps like Sports.)</p><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">Give the video a watch</a> . Again, it didn&#39;t leave me with an iota of envy for life on the Android side of the fence, but it reminded me about a bunch of things on iOS that don&#39;t make sense, and seemingly are the way they are only because that&#39;s how they always have been.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Linus Sebastian’s Thoughts After Switching to an iPhone for 30 Days’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Going Deep on &#39;Deep&#39; </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/18/deep-peak-deep-deepseek-ai-tech-chatgpt-naming/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/22/going-deep-on-deep" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41599</id><published> 2025-02-22T15:42:55Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T19:05:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>File this one under “precise words matter”.

<p>Jim Rea:</p><blockquote><p> Forty years ago today the doors opened for the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/Photos-of-the-first-Macworld-in-1985-and-why-15880682.php">very first Macworld Expo</a> in the Brooks Hall basement in San Francisco. For most of you this event probably seems like ancient history, somewhere back in the mists of time. But for me this was a very real and exciting event that I participated in as an exhibitor, the start of my amazing journey with the Mac community, a journey that continues on today.</p><p> As I recall there were two or three dozen software booths that first year. Some of the software on display included <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/multiplan-10">Multiplan</a> (Microsoft), <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/pfsfile-pfsreport">PFS:File</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/thinktank-128">Think Tank</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/filevision">FileVision</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/games/mac-slots">Mac Slots</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/habadex">Habadex</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macdraft-12">Mac Draft</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/maclion">Mac Lion</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/musicworks">Music Works</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/clickart-publications">Click Art</a> and of course <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/overvue">OverVUE</a> (the direct predecessor to today&#39;s Panorama X). Of course all of these companies have long since disappeared, except for two — Microsoft and ProVUE Development. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty nice club.</p><p> I&#39;m quite proud to have kept ProVUE Development in the Macintosh database business every single day from then to now. The RAM based database concepts I started with in 1984 are still the core of the software today, of course much further developed. In fact, if you look at screen shots of the original OverVUE from 1984, and Panorama X from 2025, the family resemblance is unmistakeable. On the left is 68k assembly code using the original Mac ROMs, on the right is Objective-C using AppKit, but the concepts are the same. There are even databases that have been brought forward from the left all the way to the right — in continuous use over four decades!</p></blockquote><p> There are old-school Mac developers still going strong, and there are <em>old school</em> Mac developers still going strong. I&#39;m not sure about this “Microsoft” company, but ProVUE&#39;s achievement here is quite remarkable. Read through for Rea&#39;s 40% discount code to celebrate this 40-year anniversary.

<p>Apple, in a very precisely worded statement issued to the media (including me) this morning:</p><blockquote><p> Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before.苹果仍然致力于为我们的用户提供最高的个人数据安全性，并希望我们将来能够在英国的情况下这样做。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">As we have said many times before</a> , we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.</p></blockquote><p> The context for this is the news that broke two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM4OTA0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwMjg2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzg5MDQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImRiNmNkODlmLThiZjMtNDkwMy05ZjJlLTFkYmIxOGJmNTViNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDIvMDcvYXBwbGUtZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1iYWNrZG9vci11ay8ifQ.jmi16EkHDs4oV8NT_duwmo2NQd8rxE3enCtbFsh8KNU&amp;itid=gfta">by Joseph Menn in The Washington Post</a> , and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57b391a0-c531-4cde-a5e9-c5d60b21a161">Tim Bradshaw in the Financial Times</a> , that (quoting Menn&#39;s report, emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p> Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. The British government&#39;s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. [...]</p><p> The office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence, the people said. The law, known by critics as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, <em>makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand</em> . An Apple spokesman declined to comment.</p></blockquote><p> By definition, end-to-end encryption can have no secret backdoor, so compliance with this order from the UK would, in broad strokes, require Apple to abandon end-to-end encryption — not just for users in the UK but all users in all countries globally. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-21"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-21">1</a></sup> More insidiously and outrageously, they are apparently forbidden by UK law, under severe penalty (imprisonment), from even informing the public about this demand, or, if they were to comply, from telling the public what they&#39;ve done. The UK expects Apple to give them secret access to all iCloud data without Apple telling anyone — including, I believe, <em>even the US government</em> — that they&#39;ve granted the UK government this breathtaking access.</p><p> Rather than comply, Apple is choosing instead to pull Advanced Data Protection from the UK. For UK users not already using ADP, the ability to enable it was already turned off before Apple&#39;s statement was sent. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">This report from BBC News</a> has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/uk-adp-screenshot.jpeg">a screenshot</a> of what UK users see if they attempt to enable it today.</p><p> Re-read Apple&#39;s statement above, which I&#39;ve quoted in full, including the hyperlink. What stands out is that Apple is offering no explanation, not even a hint, <em>why</em> the company “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature”. On issues pertaining to security and privacy, Apple always explains its policies and features as best it can. The fact that Apple has offered no hint as to why they&#39;re doing this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">canary statement</a> of sorts: they&#39;re making clear as best they can that they&#39;re under a legal gag order that prevents them from even acknowledging that they&#39;re under a legal gag order, by not telling us why they&#39;re no longer able to offer ADP in the UK. This sort of read-between-the-lines implicit confirmation that they&#39;re under a gag order is the only sort of confirmation they can legally offer, at risk of imprisonment.</p><p> Enabling ADP is controlled server-side, so Apple was able to disable the ability for UK users to turn on ADP without requiring a software update to devices. But it&#39;s an open question how this will play out for users in the UK who already have ADP enabled. Apple cannot disable ADP remotely. With a moment&#39;s thought, you can realize why they can&#39;t: it would defeat the entire purpose. In the same way that Apple can&#39;t hold its own key to decrypt a user&#39;s data with ADP, they also can&#39;t hold the ability to disable ADP.</p><p> Enabling ADP is reversible, however. After turning it on, a user can revert to standard protection, turning it off. But they must <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/adp-turn-off-screenshot.png">manually confirm</a> it. I suspect what Apple is going to do for UK users with ADP already enabled is begin issuing warnings, instructing them to disable it manually, before some deadline. Once that deadline passes, I think Apple will have to stop allowing iCloud access to ADP-protected accounts in the UK. That won&#39;t leave the data of those users unprotected — they simply will lose access to sync until they disable ADP and revert to standard protection.</p><p> The bottom line is that the UK government is proceeding like a tyrannical authoritarian state. That&#39;s not hyperbole. And the breathtaking scope of their order — being able to secretly snoop, without notice that they even have the capability, not only on their own citizens but every Apple user in the entire world — suggests a delusional belief that the British Empire still stands. It&#39;s simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hack-us-telecoms-salt-typhoon-88cabc592dae2fa870772c5ce4ace5ea">recent Salt Typhoon attack</a> China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK&#39;s actual power and standing in the world.</p><p> Apple is, rightly and righteously, telling them to fuck off.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-21"><p> If you use Advanced Data Protection, your iCloud data can only be decrypted (a) by your own devices, (b) using the recovery key that you control from when you enabled ADP, or (c) by any recovery contacts you&#39;ve created in iCloud. Apple insists that you must generate a recovery key or specify at least one recovery contact to enable ADP. Lose your devices, lose your recovery key, and lose your iCloud passphrase, and no one, including Apple, can recover your iCloud data. That level of cryptographically guaranteed security is the benefit of ADP. It&#39;s also the risk of ADP. And there&#39;s a convenience cost. For example, web access to iCloud. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Quoting from Apple&#39;s own ADP documentation</a> :</p><blockquote><p> When a user first turns on Advanced Data Protection, web access to their data at iCloud.com is automatically turned off. This is because iCloud web servers no longer have access to the keys required to decrypt and display the user&#39;s data. The user can choose to turn on web access again, and use the participation of their trusted device to access their encrypted iCloud data on the web.</p><p> After turning on web access, the user must authorize the web sign-in on one of their trusted devices each time they visit iCloud.com. The authorization “arms” the device for web access. For the next hour, this device accepts requests from specific Apple servers to upload individual service keys, but only those corresponding to an allow list of services normally accessible on iCloud.com. In other words, even after the user authorizes a web sign-in, a server request is unable to induce the user&#39;s device to upload service keys for data that isn&#39;t intended to be viewed on iCloud.com, (such as Health data or passwords in iCloud Keychain). Apple servers request only the service keys needed to decrypt the specific data that the user is requesting to access on the web. Every time a service key is uploaded, it is encrypted using an ephemeral key bound to the web session that the user authorized, and a notification is displayed on the user&#39;s device, showing the iCloud service whose data is temporarily being made available to Apple servers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s for reasons like “I lost my only device and forgot my iCloud password”, and to provide easy access to iCloud through the web, that Advanced Data Protection is not the default for all users.</p><p> I think it&#39;s technically possible that Apple could maintain “end-to-end encryption” in a pedantic sense while adding an additional UK-controlled signing key to all encrypted data in iCloud. Let&#39;s say you own two Apple devices, an iPhone and a Mac, and you use Advanced Data Protection. Your data can only be decrypted by those two devices, or by your recovery key, or by a device controlled by one of your recovery contacts. Apple could do something like add the UK government as, effectively, a recovery contact, to each and every user in the world&#39;s encrypted iCloud data. That would still be “end-to-end”, it&#39;s just that the UK government would control one of those end points. But the way iCloud security is designed, something like that cannot be added silently. When a new device is added to your iCloud account, all of your existing devices get a notification that a new device has been added. I personally see these notifications hundreds of times a year, every year, as I add new review unit devices to my account. Like back in September, I got four iPhone 16 review units, two Apple Watch review units, and purchased my own iPhone 16 Pro. And I own several Macs, several Apple Watches, and an iPad. Each one of those devices, when added to my iCloud account, even just temporarily for testing, generated a notification about the new device being added to my iCloud account to each and every one of my other devices, new or old, currently signed into my iCloud account. That&#39;s a minor annoyance for me as a product reviewer, but of course I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Apple&#39;s system is built such that new devices cannot be added to the chain without a notification being generated and sent to every existing device in your account. This notification regarding new devices happens even with standard protection — it&#39;s not exclusive to users who&#39;ve enabled ADP.</p><p> So while in theory some company could (I think?) build a system that is fairly (but deceptively) described as “end-to-end encrypted” where one of the “ends” is secretly and silently controlled by the UK government, Apple&#39;s iCloud is not such a system. Apple is prevented by UK law from explaining this, unfortunately, but I think it&#39;s true that as iCloud currently stands, Apple cannot comply with the UK&#39;s demands for ADP-protected accounts, because they can&#39;t add a UK-controlled decryption key to existing iCloud accounts without notifying every device signed into every account. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple Pulls Advanced Data Protection From the UK, in Defiance of UK Demand for Global Backdoor</title></entry><entry><title> Yankees Loosen The Boss&#39;s Facial Hair Policy </title><link href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/yankees-change-facial-hair-policy" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/yankees-facial-hair" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41595</id><published> 2025-02-21T16:10:45Z</published><updated> 2025-02-21T16:17:43Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner:</p><blockquote><p> “In recent weeks I have spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees — spanning several eras — to elicit their perspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy, and I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback. These most recent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue that dates back several years.</p><p> “Ultimately the final decision rests with me, and after great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.”</p></blockquote><p> The appropriate time to change this was years ago, but better late than never. It&#39;s the most Yankees story possible that this policy change is much bigger news than the fact that the team today also signed manager Aaron Boone to a two-year extension through the 2027 season.

<p>Erich Schwartzel and Jessica Toonkel, reporting for The Wall Street Journal back on December 19, under the headline “Where Is James Bond? Trapped in an Ugly Stalemate With Amazon” ( <a href="https://apple.news/A4AvCvPCIScSH_SJzKGD7gQ">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Nearly three years after Amazon acquired the right to release Bond movies through its $6.5 billion purchase of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio, the relationship between the family that oversees the franchise and the e-commerce giant has all but collapsed. The decaying partnership has scuttled any near-term hope of a new Bond film — a black eye for Amazon&#39;s ambitions in Hollywood, since at the time of the MGM sale, the Bond franchise represented a significant share of the $6.5 billion the company paid for the studio.</p><p> When it comes to Bond&#39;s future, the power lies in the hands of Barbara Broccoli, who inherited the control from her father, Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, and who for 30 years has decided when a new Bond movie can go into production. She has told friends she doesn&#39;t trust algorithm-centric Amazon with a character she helped to mythologize through big-screen storytelling and gut instinct. This fall, she characterized the status of a new movie in dire terms — no script, no story and no new Bond.</p><p> To friends, Broccoli has characterized her thoughts on Amazon this way: “These people are fucking idiots.”</p></blockquote><p> One way out of a stalemate, apparently, is to sell. Here&#39;s Broccoli&#39;s public statement today, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/global/james-bond-amazon-mgm-gain-creative-control-1236313930/">accompanying the news</a> that Eon Productions has reached a deal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">that shifts creative control over the franchise to Amazon</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of &#39;No Time to Die&#39; and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”</p></blockquote><p> Broccoli&#39;s brother Michael Wilson was ever so slightly more magnanimous in his statement, saying “Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future,” but it&#39;s rather striking that Broccoli said not a word about Amazon in her statement, and Wilson&#39;s praise only went so far as the lone adjective <em>trusted</em> . But the lie to Wilson&#39;s attempt at even slight magnanimity is that Eon Productions and Amazon were <em>never</em> partners. It was the old MGM Studios, before Amazon&#39;s acquisition, that was Eon&#39;s partner from the very beginning ( <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/646-dr-no">1963&#39;s <em>Dr. No</em></a> ).</p><p> I meant to post a link to this WSJ story when it broke, and mistakenly thought I had, but it slipped through the cracks around the holidays. But I&#39;ve had a bad feeling about the franchise&#39;s future ever since.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Barbara Broccoli on Amazon, in Private: ‘These People Are Fucking Idiots’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/broccoli-amazon-idiots">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Leaked Image of the First Post-Humane-Acquisition Product From HP&#39;s Printer Division </title><link href="https://x.com/VCBrags/status/1892332805570314491" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/hp-humane" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41593</id><published> 2025-02-20T16:57:38Z</published><updated> 2025-02-21T14:50:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Alex Ritman, with blockbuster news at Variety:</p><blockquote><p> Amazon MGM Studios is set to take creative control of the James Bond franchise. The shock announcement — which is sure to shake and, indeed, stir the industry — was made Thursday, alongside the news that long-time producers and custodians of 007, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, would be stepping back.</p><p> As per details of the historic agreement, Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli have formed a new joint venture to house the James Bond intellectual property rights. The three parties will remain co-owners of the iconic franchise but Amazon MGM will have creative control.</p></blockquote><p> The villains in Bond stories are often bald billionaire industrialists who either build rockets or own media companies, with lasciviously-dressed women on their arms. It&#39;s hard to imagine how we could come closer to a real-life Bond villain taking control of the franchise. (At least it wasn&#39;t Musk.)</p><p> “Nepo babies” is a term that tends only to be used pejoratively, but family ownership is a proven model to nurture and maintain — to protect — exceptional companies with exceptional cultures. Berkshire Hathaway owns several where their agreements not only allowed, but encouraged, the families to maintain control post-acquisition. <a href="https://www.sees.com/about-us/sees-family">See&#39;s Candies</a> comes to mind.<a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/SpecialLetters/WEB%20past%20present%20future%202014.pdf">This letter from Warren Buffet</a> describes their strategy. But Berkshire is itself an exceptional company. Most corporate conglomerate acquisitions of creator/family-run endeavors wreak devastation upon everything that made those smaller operations unique and special. Look at what&#39;s happened to The Washington Post now that Bezos owns it. There&#39;s much to complain about The New York Times in general, and current publisher AG Sulzberger in particular (sixth generation of family control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company">since Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896</a> ), but The Times is still The Times.</p><p> Heretofore, Barbara Broccoli did that with the 007 franchise. The output was uneven under her and Wilson&#39;s producing stewardship, but the Daniel Craig era was a splendid return to form. There&#39;s no other movie franchise like it. The closest is <em>Mission Impossible</em> but that franchise is a distant second place, in my mind. It lacks a certain magic, a timeless but yet somehow always modern <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of the 007 franchise. Always the same, but somehow always fresh.</p><p> I expect Amazon to bleed it dry, alas. Spinoffs and “universe” expansion galore, of generally low quality in all regards: writing, casting, production values. But most of all I expect they&#39;ll make the same fundamental mistake Disney has made with <em>Star Wars</em> — instead of leaving us craving more, they&#39;ll produce as much dreck as they can and leave us saying “ <em>enough, stop</em> ”, with the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/330459-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story">occasional</a> <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83867-star-wars-andor">gems</a> fighting for attention in a <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/page-b4e74f38-aa35-4b12-965c-93f4a931f78a">river</a> of <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled/">downright embarrassing unwatchable crap</a> . Somehow they managed to ruin Boba Fett.</p><p> What&#39;s the best original show or movie Amazon has ever made? <em>The Peripheral</em> was pretty good but they cancelled after its first season. <em>Reacher</em> is fun but it&#39;s junk-food fun, not serious fun. Amazon taking control of James Bond is like McDonald&#39;s taking over a great steakhouse chain like <a href="https://www.delfriscos.com/location/del-friscos-double-eagle-steakhouse-philadelphia-pa/">Del Frisco&#39;s</a> .</p><p>我对此有一种不好的感觉。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Amazon MGM Studios Takes Creative Control Over James Bond Franchise’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/thoughts_and_observations_on_todays_iphone_16e_announcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3b" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41591</id><published> 2025-02-20T04:42:10Z</published><updated> 2025-02-22T01:52:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">Tim Cook teased</a> a “newest member of the family” product announcement coming today; turns out it was <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/">the iPhone 16e</a> , a device whose name briefly paralyzed me with indecision regarding how to capitalize it, <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-19">1</a></sup> which replaces the three-year-old iPhone SE (3rd generation) in the lineup.</p><h2> The Announcement</h2><p> Apple made the announcement in a 13-minute video that is currently atop their home page, but seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">only perma-linkable at YouTube</a> . (Maybe <a href="https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-16e/2025/d9015f23-5cc1-45b4-b25a-2b1caee9d7ac/films/announcement/iphone-16e-announcement-tpl-us-2025_16x9.m3u8">this</a> ?) It was also, of course, announced in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a press release on Apple Newsroom</a> . The first three minutes of the video feature Tim Cook (talking about how great iPhones are, the iPhones 16 in particular, and Apple Intelligence). Cook hands things off to iPhone product marketing VP Kaiann Drance for the next five minutes; Drance mostly recaps iOS 18&#39;s tentpole features, especially, of course, Apple Intelligence. Drance hands off to keynote first-timer (I think) Lucy Browning, a director of iPhone product design, who talks up the 16e specifics. The most unusual thing about the video is its setting: not Apple Park, not the Steve Jobs Theater, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I&amp;t=2727s">the infinite white void</a> , where, in a bygone era, Apple TV commercials like the famed Hodgman/Long “I&#39;m a Mac / I&#39;m a PC” series were set. (The new infinite void is arguably light gray, not white.)</p><h2>名字</h2><p>First, the name. It&#39;s not the fourth-generation iPhone SE, and instead sports an altogether new “e” suffix. Apple has used an “S” suffix with the iPhones 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS; “C” with the iPhone 5C, and “R” with the XR. We shall see if this “e” is a one-off. In an online press briefing today, when asked whether the “e” stands for anything, an Apple rep said no, it does not stand for anything, but that it&#39;s built for everyone. I don&#39;t think she meant to imply that the “e” secretly stands for <em>everyone</em> , if only because I&#39;m pretty sure Apple doesn&#39;t want everyone buying the lowest-price iPhone model. Apple never had an explanation for the “SE” name either, although in my head I&#39;ve already read that as maybe sorta kinda standing for <em>special edition</em> ? Way back in the day, I think Phil Schiller once said the “S” in “iPhone 3GS” stood for <em>speed</em> , because the 3GS was in fact strikingly faster than the prior year&#39;s 3G, and the “C” in “iPhone 5C” definitely, if unofficially, stood for <em>color</em> . But it&#39;s best not to waste too much time trying to find any logic to this other than that Apple thinks “iPhone 16e” looks and sounds cool. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not the “iPhone 16 AI”.</p><p> Using the “16” generation as part of the name is more interesting than the new “e” suffix. It perhaps suggests that e-edition phones might become annual. I wouldn&#39;t bet on that. But the SE models came out in March 2016, April 2020, and March 2022, so the gaps have been irregular. At the very least though, the 16e name will help make it clear, in years to come, what the basic specs of this iPhone were and when, roughly, it debuted. Every time I&#39;ve referenced the third-gen SE in the last year or two, I&#39;ve had to look up exactly when it debuted and which A-series chip it sported (A15, same as the iPhone 13).</p><h2>定价</h2><p>As expected, the existing third-gen iPhone SE is now out of the lineup. The third-gen SE debuted in March 2022 with a starting price of $430 (for a paltry 64 GB) with 128 and 256 GB configurations for, respectively, $480 and $580. The new iPhone 16e starts at $600, which, depending on how you look at it, is either a $170 increase (in the price of the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells) or a $120 increase (in the price of the cheapest 128 GB iPhone Apple sells). I&#39;ve already seen gobs of people arguing that the iPhone 16e “should” start at just $500, but if you look at Apple&#39;s pricing for the entire iPhone 16 lineup, there are $200 gaps, for the same storage tiers, between the 16e and regular 16, and between the regular 16 and 16 Pro. So I&#39;d argue that $600 is the “right” price. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39;s inflation calculator</a> , $500 in January 2022 is about $565 in January 2025 dollars.</p><p> Here&#39;s a table with the lineup of new iPhones Apple currently sells. I&#39;m including the now-discontinued iPhone SE for reference. Also note that while these are the only models Apple itself sells to consumers, other old models are still sold by various carriers and retail partners around the world, including the iPhone SE for now. </p><table class="table-5EE26071-E20E-463E-860C-F4FEB8AD1841" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The 16e does support inductive Qi charging, but only at a pokey 7.5-watt rate. The regular 16 and 16 Pro models support MagSafe charging at up to 25 watts, and the iPhone 15 at 15 watts. You can charge an iPhone 16e using a MagSafe charging puck, but only at 7.5 watts, and it won&#39;t magnetically snap into place. It&#39;ll just function as a non-magnetic pad. I don&#39;t know if this decision was about component pricing (the $200 difference has to come from somewhere, and it&#39;s not going to be Apple&#39;s margins), the internal space that MagSafe components occupy in the device (see next section), or marketing differentiation. Probably some combination of all three. The old SE only supported 7.5-watt no-MagSafe Qi charging as well.</p><h2>电池</h2><p>Battery life is better than the regular iPhone 16. This is equally surprising to me. From Apple&#39;s own Comparison page:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png" class="noborder"><img
    src   = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Apple's comparison of battery life specs between the iPhone 16 Pro, 16, and 16e."
    width = 525
  /></a></p><p> How exactly is the 16e achieving battery life that surpasses the more expensive iPhone 16, and is effectively on par with the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro? I suspect it&#39;s a combination of a larger battery and a more efficient cellular modem. As rumored, the 16e is Apple&#39;s first iPhone with an in-house–designed modem, which, in the video, Kaiann Drance introduces thus (emphasis added): “And with iPhone 16e, we&#39;re expanding the benefits of Apple silicon with C1, the first Apple-designed cellular modem. It provides fast and reliable 5G connectivity, and <em>it&#39;s the most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone</em> .” Just as with CPUs and GPUs, Apple&#39;s interest in custom silicon isn&#39;t only about price and performance — it&#39;s about efficiency too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=199">Drance then continues</a> (speaking over a cool breakaway animation of the 16e&#39;s internal components), “We combined the incredible power efficiency of Apple silicon with an all-new internal design for iPhone 16e that has been optimized for a larger battery. Together, it paves the way for an unprecedented level of battery life in a 6.1-inch iPhone.” There might be other changes that allow the 16e to accommodate a larger battery than the regular 16, but from the spec sheet, the obvious one is the omission of MagSafe.</p><h2> Apple&#39;s C1 Chip</h2><p> The power efficiency sounds great, and of course the modem supports “5G”, but it doesn&#39;t support mmWave / ultra wideband, the crazy super-fast variant of 5G with Wi-Fi-like speed <em>and</em> Wi-Fi-like short range from carrier antennas that serve it. Block-by-block here at home in Philadelphia, I see ultra wideband from Verizon on some blocks of the city ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118203">denoted by the “5G UW” icon in the status bar</a> ), but not most. But do I really care? I honestly don&#39;t know why I&#39;m supposed to care about 5G at all compared to LTE. Using LTE instead of 5G (let alone 5G ultra wideband) makes no practical difference for anything I do over cellular on my phone. Obviously Apple wants to support ultra wideband in its own modems eventually, but their renewed deal with Qualcomm — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">announced and crowed-about only by Qualcomm</a> , because Apple despises them and deeply resents its own dependence upon them — covers “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026”. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a C-series chip in this September&#39;s expected iPhone 17 or 17 Pro — but perhaps we&#39;ll see one in the rumored iPhone 17 “Air”.</p><p> Remember too that when last I saw it tested — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">by Nicole Nguyen in 2022</a> — disabling 5G and exclusively using LTE extended the battery life of an iPhone 13 Pro from 13 to 15.5 hours in her video-streaming test. Ultra wideband 5G <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">is indeed insanely fast</a> , and regular 5G is generally faster than LTE, but for most people in most places not in ways that practically matter, especially considering the effects on battery life. “Plenty fast enough, with longer battery life” is a better trade-off than “way faster than you&#39;ll notice, with somewhat shorter battery life”.</p><p> Speaking of wireless, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the C1 chip, but the iPhone 16e supports only Wi-Fi 6, not 7, and doesn&#39;t support Thread networking.</p><h2> Just One Camera on the Back, but It&#39;s “2-in-1”</h2><p> No surprise here — cameras are expensive, and only offering one makes for very obvious differentiation. Apple&#39;s calling this lone camera “2-in-1” because, like the main camera on other recent iPhone models, it offers both 1× and 2× <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6110937480">optical fields of view</a> (1× uses the entire 48MP sensor, producing a 12MP image by treating the sensor pixel array as “quad pixels; 2× produces 12MP images by cropping the center 12MP of the sensor). The lack of a second ultra-wide camera means not just no 0.5× lens, but also no macro photography, and no spatial photos or video. The 16e also offers only “Photographic Styles”, not the “latest-generation Photographic Styles” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16#photography">offered by the 16 and 16 Pro</a> .</p><p> If you really care about your <em>camera</em> , the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t the iPhone for you. As mentioned above, it has fewer lenses and the imaging pipeline doesn&#39;t support the next-generation Photographic Styles (which, five months in, I continue to really enjoy in my own photography). But that doesn&#39;t mean the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t a valid choice for people who care about their photos. Some people really do care about their photography, but also really just point and shoot using their main 1× camera, no matter which iPhone model they own. Not worrying about camera hardware and only concerning yourself with lighting and framing is a philosophy shared by many seriously talented photographers.</p><h2> No Camera Control Button</h2><p> The other camera-hardware-related ding against the 16e is that it doesn&#39;t have the new Camera Control button/slider on the side. I know several iPhone 16 owners who claim they never use it or even flat out dislike it, because they find themselves invoking it only by accident. I really like it, and use it as my primary way to launch the Camera app and to capture images. But, you know, we all captured images and videos just fine for 17 iPhone generations without that hardware button. No matter how much you like it, you certainly don&#39;t need it.</p><p> But, up until now, you <em>did</em> need the Camera Control button to invoke <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-visual-intelligence-with-camera-control-iph12eb1545e/ios">the visual intelligence feature of Apple Intelligence</a> . A press-and-release of Camera Control launches your favorite camera app; a long-press invokes visual intelligence. Apple&#39;s solution to enable visual intelligence on the iPhone 16e, despite it lacking the Camera Control button, is two-fold. First, visual intelligence is now available in Control Center. Second, as demonstrated by Apple in the announcement video, you can assign the Action Button to visual intelligence. (By default, just as with other iPhones equipped with the Action Button, it defaults to toggling silent mode, like the dedicated ringer switch of yore — where by “yore” I mean still on the iPhone 15.)</p><p> Apple representatives also told me today that owners of the iPhone 15 Pro will soon be able to bind their Action Button to visual intelligence, “in a future software update”. I suspect that future software update is iOS 18.4, which should be launching in beta any day now, but Apple wouldn&#39;t comment, on or off the record, when exactly this feature will come to the iPhone 15 Pro. They also confirmed that the Control Center button to launch visual intelligence is also coming to iPhone 15 Pro (and presumably iPhone 16 models, too). The iPhone 15 Pro, despite qualifying for Apple Intelligence, has heretofore lacked the visual intelligence feature, because the visual intelligence feature has only been trigger-able via the Camera Control button. It&#39;s a little odd, frankly, that Apple didn&#39;t enable this feature via the Action Button and Control Center for 15 Pro users months ago — perhaps they really wanted to wait for the 16e announcement?</p><h2>展示</h2><p>The 16e display specs seem pretty good, but the front sensor array is behind a notch, not a dynamic island. That&#39;s a reasonable design trade-off for the lowest-price model. The 16 and 16 Pro displays offer maximum brightness specs of 1,000 nits (typical), 1,600 nits (HDR), and 2,000 nits (outdoor). The 16e display offers 800 nits (typical), 1,200 (HDR), and doesn&#39;t go higher than that. The 16 and 16 Pro dislays also go down to just 1 nit minimum brightness; Apple doesn&#39;t list a minimum brightness for the 16e display.</p><h2>硅</h2><p>The A18 chip in the iPhone 16e seems (on the specs page) nearly identical to that of the iPhone 16, except for the number of GPU cores: the 16e has only 4 GPU cores, but the regular iPhone 16 has 5. (The A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max has 6 GPU cores.) No big whoop.</p><p> What&#39;s more interesting than comparing to the iPhone 16 is comparing to the iPhone 15, which costs $100 more than the 16e. Because the only A17-generation chip was the A17 Pro that went into the iPhone 15 Pro models, the regular iPhone 15 has the same A16 chip from the iPhone 14 model year. Aside from all the general performance improvements in the A18 compared to the two-year-old A16, the big functional difference is that the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 15 does not. As covered extensively when Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC last June, that&#39;s mainly a function of RAM, but whatever the reasons, the less expensive iPhone 16e has Apple Intelligence, and the iPhone 15 does not. Maybe that&#39;s not a <em>big</em> whoop, but it&#39;s definitely a whoop of some sort.</p><p> Perhaps, like the three generations of SE models, the iPhone 16e is designed to stay around for several years at this price point. If it does, the fact that it costs $100 less than the “year-old regular iPhone” will make more sense come September, when that $700 year-old model is the iPhone 16. But until September, the iPhone 16e looks like a better phone in several ways than the iPhone 15. It has a faster chip that supports Apple Intelligence and significantly longer battery life. The iPhone 15 does have a 0.5× ultra-wide camera, and it has a slightly better display (that includes the nicer dynamic island instead of a notch). And of course the iPhone 15 comes in colors like pink, yellow, green, and blue. But if you keep your phone in a case all the time, like most people do, you probably don&#39;t care about the color of your phone much. The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less.</p><h2>颜色</h2><p>You can get any color 16e that you want, so long as it&#39;s black or white. The third-gen iPhone SE came in midnight, starlight, and Product Red. (Is Apple done partnering with Product Red now? I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-marks-world-aids-day-with-red/">Apple Watch Series 9 was the last device offered with Product Red</a> .)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-19"><p> For a while with the iPhone 4S, there was some ambiguity whether Apple intended the “S” to be upper- or lowercase, because their marketing materials used a small-cap “S”, and a small-cap “S” looks almost exactly like a lowercase “s”. They settled on uppercase for the 4S. But when the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, Apple not only styled both of those suffixes lowercase, they retroactively re-styled the &#39;S&#39; in the &#39;4S&#39; as lowercase. I wrote about this at length <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">in this footnote in my iPhone 5S and 5C review in 2013</a> , in which I explained my decision to uppercase them. But I sort of like the way “16e” looks. It&#39;s ... friendly? And the lowercase “e” carries the correct implication that this is a lesser sibling to the regular iPhone 16, not an upgrade or superior of some sort. So for now, I&#39;m going with the flow and keeping the “e” lowercase. One friend, to whom I vented my consternation regarding how to handle this, unhelpfully suggested I go with <em>iPhone 16ᵉ</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Thoughts and Observations on Today&#39;s iPhone 16e Announcement</title></entry><entry><title> &#39;Oh, the Humane-ity&#39; </title><link href="https://spyglass.org/humane-ai-pin-strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/oh-the-humane-ity" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41590</id><published> 2025-02-19T16:48:23Z</published><updated> 2025-02-19T16:48:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MG Siegler:</p><blockquote><p> A regular person might read that headline and think, “wow, a startup sold for <em>nine-figures</em> — impressive.” Of course, it&#39;s not impressive in this case. It&#39;s a fire sale for a company that has been under duress for months after their product, the Ai Pin, failed to catch fire in the market. Actually, that&#39;s not technically true. There was a <em>literal</em> risk of fire when charging the device, <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Humane-Recalls-Charge-Case-Accessory-for-Ai-Pin-Due-to-Lithium-Battery-Fire-Hazard?ref=spyglass.org">which led to a recall</a> .

<p>From Humane&#39;s “AI Pin Consumers FAQ”, which <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers">they link to</a> with one of the best euphemisms of the year thus far — “We understand this transition may be difficult, and you may have questions”:</p><blockquote><p> Key Dates to Remember:</p><ul><li> <em>Effective immediately</em> : Ai Pin is no longer available for new purchases.</li><li> <em>February 28, 2025 at 12pm PST</em> : Ai Pin devices will no longer connect to Humane&#39;s servers, and .Center access will be fully retired.</li><li> <em>February 28, 2025 at 12pm PST</em> : All customer data, including personal identifiable information (PII), will be permanently deleted from Humane&#39;s servers.</li></ul></blockquote><p> This was a $700 purchase (for the matte black base model — polished metal ones were $800) with a mandatory $24/month service charge (which included cellular networking) and extra battery “boosters” were $70. Customers who bought when it launched last April have spent at least $1,000, but probably more, all told. Humane gave them 10 days notice before the thing turns into a brick.</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will I receive a refund for my Ai Pin?</em></p><p> Refunds are only available for customers who are still within the 90-day return window from their original shipment date. You are eligible to receive a refund if your product shipped on or after November 15th, 2024. All device shipments prior to November 15th, 2024 are not eligible for refunds. All refunds must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.</p></blockquote><p> Translation: tough shit.</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will my Ai Pin work with another cellular provider after the shutdown?</em></p><p> No. Once the service is discontinued, your Ai Pin will no longer function as a cellular device or connect to Humane&#39;s servers. This means no calls, texts, or data usage will be possible. [...]</p><p> <em>Can I still use my Ai Pin for offline features?</em></p><p>是的。 After February 28, 2025, Ai Pin will still allow for offline features like battery level, etc., but will not include any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access.</p></blockquote><p> You can check the battery of a device that no longer offers any useful functionality. I get it, companies go bust, and when they go bust, their services go bust with them. But this is exactly the sort of outcome that made Humane&#39;s AI Pin seem more like a scam than a product all along.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘When ‘FAQ’ Stands for ‘Fucking Angry Questions’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/humane-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> We Found the Sucker Willing to Buy Humane, and as Promised, I&#39;m Going to Be Insufferable, Because of Course It Was HP </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/hp-116-million-deal-for-humane-includes-ip-but-no-ai-pin-device" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w38" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41588</id><published> 2025-02-18T22:42:14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-18T22:49:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Brody Ford, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> HP Inc. will acquire assets from Humane Inc., the maker of a wearable Ai Pin introduced in late 2023, for $116 million.</p><p> The deal will include the majority of Humane&#39;s employees in addition to its software platform and intellectual property, the company said Tuesday. It will not include Humane&#39;s Ai pin device business, which will be wound down, an HP spokesperson said.</p><p> Humane&#39;s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate artificial intelligence into the company&#39;s personal computers, printers and connected conference rooms, said Tuan Tran, who leads HP&#39;s AI initiatives. Chaudhri and Bongiorno were design and software engineers at Apple Inc. before founding the startup.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale">Yours truly, last May</a> , when news broke that Humane was looking for a buyer, “seeking a price of between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale”:</p><blockquote><p> I suspect they&#39;ll sell for a pittance — way less than the $230 million they&#39;ve raised. I just don&#39;t see what they have to offer. Humane doesn&#39;t own the AI that powers the AI Pin — that comes from OpenAI, which seemingly not only doesn&#39;t want to buy Humane, but is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893939/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence-device">supposedly in exploratory talks</a> with Jony Ive&#39;s LoveFrom to design and build their own AI devices. The laser projector idea seems to be a bust, and the hardware&#39;s battery life is measured in hours between battery pack swaps.</p><p> Off the top of my head, the only company that could afford a $1 billion-ish price for Humane <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/304397/the-hp-autonomy-lawsuit-timeline-of-an-ma-disaster.html">is dumb enough</a> to do it is HP.</p></blockquote><p> Well, at least we can say HP was smart enough not to spend $1 billion on this. But they were dumb enough to bring into their company Chaudhri, who was described to me, by someone who worked with him at Apple (and a person whom I&#39;ve never heard badmouth a single other former colleague), as “an utter fraud”. But a fraud whose <a href="http://www.imranchaudhri.com/">personal website</a> is an inadvertent testimony to the lunacy of the US patent system — that it serves ego inflation, not innovation.</p><p>但是谁知道？ Maybe I&#39;m all wet and Humane will prove to HP what NeXT proved to Apple, and we&#39;ll all be hanging on every thread of Imran Chaudhri keynotes in a few years and he&#39;ll lead HP back to greatness.

<p>You saw the news last week, I&#39;m sure, that both of the major mapping-app providers, Google and Apple, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">have updated their maps to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”</a> . Microsoft&#39;s Bing Maps, which I would describe as a minor provider, has made the change too. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-17">1</a></sup> It&#39;s all actually quite a bit more complicated than “they renamed the Gulf of Mexico”, but bear with me for now.</p><p> You&#39;ve also seen, I&#39;m equally sure, a lot of people angry at Google and Apple for going along with this. That anger is — to some degree — misplaced. I get where the anger comes from, but it&#39;s still misplaced. My initial take, right in the midst of Trump&#39;s inauguration speech on January 20, was that if he went through with it, Apple and Google and everyone else who publishes maps should just ignore it. Trump, obviously, did go through with it: the United States Geological Survey, an agency within the Department of the Interior, which is within the executive branch and thus under the president&#39;s purview, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/gulf-america">officially made the change on February 7</a> . Now that it&#39;s official US government policy, “just ignore it” really isn&#39;t feasible. If that&#39;s still your stance, I implore you to consider at least a bit more nuance.</p><p> But let&#39;s first stipulate up front that there are multiple far more important and urgent issues facing the United States and the world, just four short weeks into the Trump 2.0 administration. Off the top of my head: Ukraine, Gaza, tariffs, DOGE, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/nyregion/scotten-letter.html?unlocked_article_code=1.w04.Lkj2.Tu4sBTtDGwqQ&amp;smid=url-share">the rule of law</a> . Whether you approve or disapprove of Trump&#39;s actions on any or all of those issues, there should be no question that all of them are important and consequential. The name we see on maps for a body of water, not as much. But it&#39;s the smallness, the relative unimportance, the spiteful pettiness of the renaming in the first place — down to the fact that until Trump&#39;s executive action, there was no controversy, <em>zero</em> , <em>none</em> , <em>nada</em> , anywhere in the world, amongst any group of people, regarding the name of the Gulf of Mexico — that makes it interesting to examine in detail how Google and Apple have chosen to deal with it. It&#39;s only because this particular issue is so spectacularly piddling that we can consider it in full.</p><p> The motivation behind the name change is simple as well. Trump didn&#39;t change the US&#39;s officially recognized name of, say, the Atlantic Ocean or the continent of Africa. He just as easily could, but he won&#39;t. And it&#39;s not like “Gulf of Mexico” was on a list of “debatable or controversial names” until he created this controversy out of thin air. It&#39;s just the one name on the globe that a president of the United States can change to stick it to Mexico, a country Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/judge-curiel-trump-border-wall/index.html">has objectively racist feelings toward</a> . Trump never campaigned on building a wall at our <em>northern</em> border with Canada, nor has he (yet?) attempted to rename Lake Ontario. It&#39;s about Mexico, and asserting power by fiat. Trump has a lifelong history of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trump-in-name-only-how-investors-lost-millions-buying-into-t">putting his name on buildings he doesn&#39;t own</a> . He&#39;d rather have his name emblazoned on a building he doesn&#39;t own than own a building that doesn&#39;t bear his name. To Trump, the name on the sign is more important than the deed. So too, now, with the name on a map. The Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water that belongs to no nation, but declaring this new name implies that it heretofore belonged to Mexico, and now belongs to us, which is to say belongs to him, our unquestioned dear leader. That Trump took it from Mexico, without firing a shot — when in fact all he did was order a string to be changed in a government database. Shakespeare would have us believe that a sea by any other name would taste as salty. Trump doesn&#39;t read Shakespeare.</p><h2> How Google and Apple Are Labelling the Gulf, Globally</h2><p> The first important thing to know is that Google Maps and Apple Maps are not singular global atlases. They both show different names (and in rare cases, different geographies) in different regions around the world. They each are more like a collection of regional atlases. In constrast, there&#39;s only one <a href="https://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a> . If the OED changes a word&#39;s definition, or adds a new word, those changes appear to everyone in the world. My OED is your OED, no matter where you and I live or currently find ourselves on the globe. Google and Apple Maps aren&#39;t like that. It&#39;s better to think of them as services that provide region-by-region maps.</p><p> Google, to their credit, has a blog post <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">describing and illustrating exactly what users around the world now see in Google Maps</a> :</p><blockquote><p> In the US, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) has officially <a href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730">updated</a> “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” As we <a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951">announced</a> two weeks ago and consistent with our longstanding practices, we&#39;ve begun rolling out changes to reflect this update. People using Maps in the US will see “Gulf of America,” and people in Mexico will see “Gulf of Mexico.” Everyone else will see both names.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/google-maps-gulf.png">As their illustration shows</a> , “both names” means putting “Gulf of America” in parentheses for users who are anywhere else in the world other than the US or Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</p><p> Apple&#39;s approach has been more Apple-like, which is to say without comment. They made no public comment before changing the name in Apple Maps, and they have made no public comment since. (I&#39;ve asked Apple PR for comment, but gotten none.) I&#39;d appreciate a statement, like Google&#39;s, stating what users around the world should expect to see. But I also understand their desire to say as little as possible. In a sense, the labels on Apple Maps speak for themselves, and are the only thing that actually matters. I also appreciate, that by never declaring a policy on the matter, Apple can change its map labels without rescinding or amending a policy.</p><p> So without a statement from Apple describing how the Gulf is labelled around the world, I did what I could: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114003192100392251">I asked my followers on Mastodon who are outside the US what they saw as the Gulf&#39;s name</a> , and to include screenshots if possible. That was on Friday, 14 February, after Apple Maps began showing “Gulf of America” in place of “Gulf of Mexico” to users here in the US. The response was overwhelming, with replies from people in over two dozen countries from around the world. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-17">2</a></sup> And at the time, their replies suggested that Apple was taking a subtly but intriguingly different approach from Google. To wit, while everyone in the US saw “Gulf of America” (with no mention of the established name), everyone everywhere else in the world still saw “Gulf of Mexico” (or their language&#39;s translation of that name), with no mention, in parentheses or otherwise, of the new name now recognized by the United States.</p><p> I hoped that that was Apple&#39;s plan, which would have been quietly subversive in isolating the United States as the only country in the world to even see the name “Gulf of America”. But I feared that Apple was simply slower than Google, that changes had been applied for users in the US first, but changes for the rest of the world simply hadn&#39;t propagated. My fears were warranted.</p><p> Late in the evening (US Eastern Time) on Saturday, 15 February, new responses to my entreaty on Mastodon began showing labels in Apple Maps that matched Google&#39;s:</p><ul><li> In the US: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> In Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> I believe that the determining factor for what label you see, at least for Apple Maps, is unrelated to your physical location as determined by GPS or your IP address, but simply the region setting of your OS. On both MacOS and iOS, that&#39;s in Settings → General → Language &amp; Region → Region. This makes sense — you can use Apple Maps (and Google Maps) with Location Services turned off. You can play with this setting on your device to see what users around the world see in Maps without leaving your home, and without changing your device&#39;s language. Thus, if you&#39;re an American with your device set to the “United States” region, if you travel outside the US without changing your device settings, you&#39;ll still see the US-specific new name for the gulf: “Gulf of America”, with its historic and world-recognized name — dare I say, its unambiguously <em>correct</em> name — not even referenced in parentheses.</p><h2> The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment</h2><p> This whole thing, needless to say, sucks. It&#39;s profoundly stupid, and the aspects that aren&#39;t stupid are jingoistic. But the notion that Google or Apple might reasonably just ignore this and tell Trump (and the entire Republican Party, and their supporters) to go pound sand is facile. I&#39;m not saying they <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do it. Of course they <em>could</em> . That&#39;s like saying Trump <em>can&#39;t</em> just declare a new name for an international body of water with a heretofore uncontroversial 400-year-old name.</p><p> But it wouldn&#39;t be reasonable. It is reasonable for Google and Apple Maps to defer to, or at least acknowledge, the officially recognized names for each region in which they&#39;re available. It&#39;s not Google&#39;s or Apple&#39;s place to determine and adjudicate the official names on a map; their job is to recognize and display those names. In theory Google and/or Apple <em>could</em> position themselves as a global authoritative reference for geographic names. To be to maps something akin to the OED or Merriam-Webster to the English language. But if they were to pursue that route they&#39;d put themselves in the position of adjudicating any and all controversies and disputes over names and borders. Civic government is where we should <em>want</em> such disputes arbitrated, if not resolved. Not by private companies. If Apple Maps is to be available in China, Apple Maps needs to present names and borders ( <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">and even the size of land masses</a> — more on this below) that are amenable to the Chinese government. China sticks out because their demands are in stark contrast to the names and borders recognized by the rest of the world. Chinese maps are governed by CCP-mandated dogma. Most maps are governed by geographic and geopolitical reality. Taiwan, for example, is in fact an independent nation. Chinese maps (including those served by Apple to mainland Chinese users) label Taiwan as a province of China.</p><p> Now the United States is governed by another such dogma-driven regime.</p><p> In theory, maps ought not be political. In practice, they are and always have been. In theory, reasonable decisions and objectively correct decisions are one and the same when it comes to cartography. In practice, politics intercedes and they conflict. You can argue (and many people are) that Google and Apple should stick with the 400-year-old, recognized-the-world-over, and heretofore uncontroversial name “Gulf of Mexico”, and apply it globally. To simply ignore the new officially-recognized name of the gulf by the United States government. They <em>could</em> do that. No one would go to prison if they did. There would be no fines. But there would be a price to pay. Ignoring the new “Gulf of America” name recognized by the US government would, without question, court controversy. Republicans started to complain <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dan-crenshaw-complains-to-tim-cook-that-apple-maps-hasn-t-changed-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america/ar-AA1xIK2t">that Apple Maps hadn&#39;t adopted the new name</a> three weeks ago, before the change was even made official in the government&#39;s GNIS reference database.</p><p> To ignore political reality is to court political controversy. It is not in the interests of large multinational corporations to court controversy. But it&#39;s not possible to <em>avoid</em> controversy. What is reasonable is to minimize controversy. There&#39;s a famous quote from Michael Jordan, when he declined to publicly endorse the Democratic challenger to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/08/29/jesse-helms-white-racist/42090cb6-2e9b-4b13-a820-2a9b74c88fbe/">unabashedly racist</a> Republican Jesse Helms in the 1990 North Carolina Senate race: “ <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29130478/michael-jordan-stands-firm-republicans-buy-sneakers-too-quote-says-was-made-jest">Republicans buy sneakers, too.</a>透明</p><p>Some might say “That&#39;s the problem with capitalism.” I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s one of the <em>benefits</em> of capitalism. Unless you think extreme polarization is in the service of society, you want to see major institutions that are apolitical. For-profit corporations naturally serve that role. Yes, there&#39;s a profit motive. Republicans don&#39;t just buy sneakers, they buy phones and conduct web searches too. But who wants to see a world where everything is polarized politically, where every retailer, every device maker, every online service provider, every restaurant, every single thing you do, buy, or visit, is viewed through a polarized political prism? That way lies madness.</p><p> Most Americans, and most people in the western world, are beyond exhausted by our current levels of societal polarization. Escalating tensions further is not just contrary to the bottom-line interests of Apple and Google, it&#39;s in none of our interests. People just want good accurate maps. They don&#39;t want to choose — or worse, to be forced to choose — between right-leaning maps and left-leaning maps.</p><p> So if your argument is that neither Apple nor Google should be showing the name “Gulf of America” to anyone, anywhere, I&#39;m with you that that&#39;s the correct cartographical stance. But it would constitute political malpractice. Maps are important services to both companies, but the editorial integrity of their maps isn&#39;t close to their primary business or purpose. Maps aren&#39;t to Google or Apple what the English language is to the OED or Merriam-Webster. (Or what the news is to, say, the Associated Press. Hold that thought.)</p><p> So whether Google and Apple should show the new name at all shouldn&#39;t be the question we&#39;re asking. The right question is necessarily more nuanced: Who should see which names, where? And Google and Apple&#39;s answers to <em>that</em> question are, alas, disappointing and worrisome. I&#39;ll repeat the seemingly identical policy both companies are <em>actually</em> presenting today, by region:</p><ul><li> United States: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> The best politically realistic option they could have chosen would be (I&#39;ll use italics to emphasize that these are my own suggestions):</p><ul><li> <em>United States: “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”</em> .</li><li> <em>Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico”</em> .</li></ul><p> There&#39;s no good reason to even show “Gulf of America” in parentheses outside the US. We&#39;re the ones with the stupid name change on the books, so we&#39;re the ones who should get stuck seeing the stupid name. No one else should suffer the consequences of our political idiocy. But it <em>is</em> correct to show us, in America, the new dumb “Gulf of America” name. Again, if it were up to me, American users would see “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”, and everyone else would just see “Gulf of Mexico”. But that&#39;s surely the best we in the reality-based community could hope for.</p><p> It&#39;s absurd that users here in the US no longer see “Gulf of Mexico” at all. You can search for that term, and the “Gulf of America” will be the first result, but the 400-year-old name “Gulf of Mexico” no longer appears as a label on maps to US-region users for either Google Maps or Apple Maps. In any even vaguely reasonable political climate, even those in favor of the name change would endorse, perhaps even insist upon, a transitional period where the previous, familiar name appears in parentheses. Insisting that the name be changed in a snap, with no parenthetical reference to the previous name (a name that, again, has been recognized globally for over 400 years, and remains on every single printed map in existence, and every single work of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-old-man-and-the-sea-the-hemingway-library-edition-ernest-hemingway/15532053?ean=9781476787848&amp;next=t&amp;next=t">literature</a> and history referencing the Gulf) has some truly Orwellian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a> vibes. We&#39;ve always been at war with Eastasia. It&#39;s always been the Gulf of America.</p><p> The US political right often makes use of the term “ <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/snowflake/">snowflake</a> ” to suggest that those on the left are delicate and fragile. But it sure seems snowflaky to object to “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” as a map label. Sticks and stones may break their bones but a historically accurate parenthetical map label will hurt them? Food for thought as you enjoy your <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/congress-french-freedom-fries-iraq/">freedom fries</a> .</p><p> Consider the simple premise that a map ought to make sense to someone who doesn&#39;t follow current events. That ought to be uncontroversial. But to someone who has tuned out of the news for the last two months this change must seem downright baffling. Even worse, it&#39;s misleading. There&#39;s no reason for most people even to suspect, let alone know, that both Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and labels. Americans, in general, tend to be parochial. Showing Americans the name “Gulf of America”, without “(Gulf of Mexico)” strongly implies that this is now the new world-recognized name, when in the fact the truth is quite the opposite: it&#39;s a name recognized by one and only one country. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-17">3</a></sup></p><p> Not showing the new name, at all, to Americans would be unreasonably provocative to the Trump administration and its supporters. But showing the new name to every region in the world but Mexico itself is needlessly obsequious to Trump and his supporters. And making Mexico an exception to global naming policy isn&#39;t an honor or a favor to them — it&#39;s an implied insult. It insinuates that there&#39;s something wrong with them, too, legitimizing the notion that outside the US Trumpist right, there&#39;s a legitimate debate about the Gulf&#39;s name. The implied message is “ <em>Here you go, you delicate idiots, we&#39;ll make you the second of only two nations in the world regarding the displayed name of this body of water — you, and the United States.</em> ” Mexico neither asked for nor provoked any of this. (Mexico only achieved independence from Spain in 1821; the “Gulf of Mexico” name is twice as old as Mexico as a nation, and at least 150 years older than the United States.)</p><p> There are numerous countries where Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and differing disputed borders ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/9wq9vf/why_is_there_no_border_on_google_maps_between/">or lack thereof</a> ). From <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/">a 2020 report in The Washington Post</a> :</p><blockquote><p> And the line in Western Sahara marking the northern border with Morocco disappears for Moroccans seeking it out on the Web — along with the region&#39;s name altogether. The sparsely populated northwest Africa region is disputed between Morocco, which seized it in 1975, and the indigenous Sahrawi.</p><p> Sometimes that flies in the face of international consensus. Google Maps users inside Turkey can find the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or TRNC, represented in the northern third of the Mediterranean island nation. The territory is not recognized by the United Nations, nor Google&#39;s mapping competitors.</p></blockquote><p> There are other places around the world where Apple and Google show downright crazy or incorrect things on maps. The latter have one thing in common: they are to comply with the demands of countries governed by thin-skinned autocratic men who surround themselves with sycophants. As mentioned above, in China, Taiwan <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/fact-check-apple-maps-taiwan-03072024174451.html">is falsely labelled as a province of China in Apple Maps</a> . <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-17">4</a></sup> (Google Maps, like Google services generally, aren&#39;t available in China.) In 2021, in a report for The Information headlined “ <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">Inside Tim Cook&#39;s Secret $275 Billion Deal with Chinese Authorities</a> ”, Wayne Ma reported:</p><blockquote><p> Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China&#39;s State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu Islands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from them. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn&#39;t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.</p><p> Some members of the team back at Apple&#39;s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps app had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company complied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in mainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than surrounding territories.</p></blockquote><p> You&#39;ll stand on firm ground criticizing Apple for capitulating to China&#39;s demands on that. But the root problem clearly isn&#39;t Apple. It&#39;s that China is governed by communist authoritarians, and authoritarianism warps minds — including those of the authoritarian leaders themselves. You know what no one says? “ <em>The leadership of China is completely sane and sensible, and their edicts are based on reality, not dogma.</em>透明</p><p>If you don&#39;t see that Trump&#39;s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is on the same spectrum of nuttiness, then your mind, at least on this matter, has been warped. We can argue how far along that spectrum this “Gulf of America” thing is, but the only reasonable debate is of matters of degree. Apple and Google&#39;s decision to show this made-up name in parentheses to everyone around the world is akin to showing China&#39;s fictionally inflated size of the Diaoyu Islands to everyone in the world, as, say, a dotted outline surrounding the geographically accurate representations of the actual islands&#39; sizes. There&#39;s a word for this stuff, and that word is <em>propaganda</em> .</p><p> Imagine if the government of France decreed that the English Channel was now the “French Channel”. Now imagine that Google and Apple Maps complied, even just to the degree of changing the label, <em>outside</em> France (which, per their company policies, should see “French Channel”) and the United Kingdom (which would still see only “English Channel”) to show the rest of the world, including us in the United States, “English Channel (French Channel)”. It would rightfully be considered insulting nonsense.</p><p> The only difference from my hypothetical and our reality with the Gulf of Mexico is that France, in addition to not having a narcissistic would-be autocrat as its president ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-gets-new-government-after-weeks-uncertainty-2024-09-21/">yet</a> ?), is not the world&#39;s lone remaining superpower. That&#39;s what makes Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s acquiescence worrisome, not merely irritating. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamellebouie.net/post/3lia22gxsgk24">pithily observed over the weekend</a> , on Bluesky, “My take is that your willingness to accept this Gulf of America nonsense is an indicator of your willingness to accept much worse things coming from this administration.”</p><p> The calculus Google and Apple should naturally be striving to achieve is finding the correct balance between two axes. One axis is integrity: both the cartographic integrity of the labels on the companies&#39; maps, and the institutional integrity — <em>dignity</em> even — of the companies themselves. Billions of people around the world trust Google and Apple. Their decisions on this mapping matter — no matter how trivial in the grand scheme of things — should strengthen, not erode, that trust.</p><p> The other axis is the minimization of controversy.</p><p> Simply maximizing integrity — by ignoring the “Gulf of America” name completely — would incur volcanic controversy within the United States. This calculated balance is behind my suggestion of showing “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” within the United States, and showing just “Gulf of Mexico” everywhere else. Perhaps the inclusion of the longstanding name within parentheses is too much for freedom-fry-eating Republicans. But showing the new “Gulf of America” name in parentheses to everyone around the world is itself incurring controversy, and, more tellingly, is a strike against the integrity of both the companies and their maps.</p><p> Obsequiousness is inherently undignified. Google and Apple are proud companies. But both have chosen a gratuitously undignified presentation of this new American-dictated name to the entire world. Their mutual decision here ultimately seems driven not by integrity (to be sure), nor the minimization of controversy, but instead by a third, unnatural factor: fear.</p><p> Neither company will comment on it but surely this issue — inconsequential in the grand scheme of things though it may be — rose to the highest ranks of leadership. I&#39;ll eat my hat if Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook didn&#39;t both sign off on, if not actively participate in the decision-making process, how to represent the Gulf of Mexico&#39;s name. Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. But so eager are Pichai and Cook to avoid the wrath and vindictiveness of Trump that they&#39;re willing to peddle his foolish “Gulf of America” name to everyone in the world who doesn&#39;t live in Mexico. Wrapping it in parentheses is like wrapping a dead fish in newspaper — it doesn&#39;t contain the stench.</p><p> Of course “The Gulf of America” name is stupid. Trump is stupid. Not stupid meaning dim or dull — would that he were, but he remains sharp, cunning, and highly agitated — but stupid because he&#39;s nuts, warped by a narcissistic disorder of Napoleonic dimensions. The new name is as stupid as his MAGA hats are ugly. He might as well have sold<a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Subsidized_Time">the naming rights</a> to Musk and Tesla. There is something really wrong with him, and this “Gulf of America” name change exemplifies at least one aspect of his narcissistic insanity.每个人都知道。 Even his supporters know it. They just tell themselves it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s how tribalism morphs into cultism.</p><p> The false note in Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s parable “The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes” is that once the emperor is called out, for in fact strutting around stark naked while ostensibly wearing a suit of clothes so fine that they&#39;ve visible only to the eyes of smart and discerning people, is that <em>all</em> the townsfolk laugh at him. That wouldn&#39;t happen. Many would laugh. Most, one hopes. But the emperor&#39;s die-hard supporters would react with anger at the outburst of mockery, not join in the laughter. He looks great, they&#39;d insist, not like the jackass their own lying eyes tell them he is.</p><p> There is something wrong with Trump — and there is something lesser, but worrisomely wrong with those defending him.</p><p> Apple Maps and Google Maps do not consider themselves cartographic editorial authorities. They choose not to show one universal set of mapping (and naming) data to the world.他们可以。但是他们没有。 Actual editorial authorities, on the other hand, are under no obligation to follow the US GNIS&#39;s official decisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Wikipedia correctly still calls it The Gulf of Mexico</a> . The Associated Press, whose stylebook is followed by many publications, small and large, <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/">issued the following guidance after Trump&#39;s executive order last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The body of water has shared borders between the US and Mexico. Trump&#39;s order only carries authority within the United States. Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.</p></blockquote><p> The Trump administration — petty, stupid, vindictive, and most of all, <em>insecure</em> fools that they are — has lashed out, and is now in the midst of a weeklong standoff <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/white-house-continues-its-absurd-ban-against-the-associated-press/">during which they&#39;ve prevented AP journalists from attending official events</a> , entirely and solely because of the AP&#39;s perfectly reasonable style guidance on the Gulf&#39;s name. If Trump and his 2.0 administration had any modicum of confidence that this name change is correct and justified, they&#39;d roll their eyes, not lash out, at the Associated Press for continuing to stipulate otherwise. What kind of government does stuff like that? Everyone knows the answer: tin-pot dictator autocracies. (And <em>would-be</em> autocracies, we can hope.) <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-17">5</a></sup> This whole “Gulf of America” thing is, if you take a step back, objectively hilarious. Like Pinocchio turning into a real boy, Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico is like a late night comedy joke turned real. It&#39;s beyond parody. If this had been on SNL during the 2024 campaign, you&#39;d have laughed. And you should laugh now. Mockery is a powerfully subversive weapon against authority — even more effective, I&#39;d argue, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists">than a guitar</a> .</p><p> But it&#39;s worth directing our laughter at Google and Apple as well. They&#39;re squandering their own hard-earned reputations for integrity to suggest there&#39;s even a parenthetical alternative-name level of international legitimacy — not merely one man&#39;s vanity — behind this.没有。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-17"><p> <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> , god bless them, are still labelling it “Gulf of Mexico”.

McKinley — a change reflected identically to all users in all regions around the world in both Google Maps and Apple Maps. The mountain in question is US territory, and countries get to name their own mountains.

<p>Extraordinary illustrated essay by Marcin Wichary, documenting a typeface — and its long, fascinating, splintered history — that exemplifies the difference between <em>beautiful</em> and <em>pretty</em> . The beauty in Gorton isn&#39;t just in its plainness and hardworking mechanical roots — it&#39;s in the history of the 20th century itself.

<p>New research published from Apple machine learning researchers Yuhan Hu, Peide Huang, Mouli Sivapurapu, Jian Zhang:</p><blockquote><p> Nonverbal behaviors such as posture, gestures, and gaze are essential for conveying internal states, both consciously and unconsciously, in human interaction. For robots to interact more naturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities — such as intention, attention, and emotions — alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment, spatial constraints, and time efficiency. In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a lamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and expressive objectives in movement design.</p></blockquote><p> I enjoyed seeing something Luxo-esque made real, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12493">the paper itself</a> is fairly readable — and worth skimming at least for the illustrations. But I&#39;ll wait for an actual product to get excited. Unlike <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">marketing concept videos</a> , I don&#39;t think publishing academic research is harmful to a company — and in fact, as has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/26/apple-ai-research-paper">much</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/07/19/apple-machine-learning-journal">discussed</a> regarding Apple&#39;s institutional penchant for secrecy, it&#39;s seemingly essential for Apple to not only permit but encourage this, to recruit top-tier talent in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. But publishing academic research is closer to publishing marketing concept videos than it is to releasing an actual product. Which is to say it doesn&#39;t count.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Research Paper Documents Anthropomorphic, Emotionally Expressive Robot Lamp, à la Pixar’s Luxo’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/16/apple-luxo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Martin Pilkington, Longtime Stalwart of the Mac and Apple Developer Community, Dies From Cancer </title><link href="https://mastodon.social/@pilky/114008572002612525" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2z" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/martin-pilkington-rip" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41579</id><published> 2025-02-15T19:03:56Z</published><updated> 2025-02-16T15:10:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Joe Rosensteel:</p><blockquote><p> Netflix deeply regrets accidentally making Netflix a better product for its customers. It temporarily pushed out a change that let people <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/have-apple-and-netflix-finally-made-an-apple-tv-deal/">see Netflix shows in the Apple TV app</a> , a change people have been asking for since the debut of the Apple TV app in 2016 with its Up Next queue and content aggregation features. Fortunately, Netflix swiftly corrected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">the error</a> before too many of its users could experience anything approaching joy, or satisfaction with Netflix. Customers should definitely drop the issue and not press Netflix to turn the feature that certainly exists back on.</p></blockquote><p> I see why Netflix is sticking to its guns on this one, but they&#39;re on the wrong side. Apple TV users were overjoyed yesterday when the Netflix app briefly started integrating with the TV app for “what next”, etc. Steven Aquino described it as “ <a href="https://www.curbcuts.co/blog/apple-and-netflix-must-do-right-and-finally-make-tv-app-peace-for-accessibilitys-sake">jubilance</a> ”.</p><p> Only a small subset — perhaps, by Netflix&#39;s grand global scale, downright minuscule — of Netflix users use Apple TV hardware. But those of us who do, do so because we love it. Most people think “Why pay extra for yet another box to connect, yet another remote control, yet another thing to learn, when Netflix and most other popular streaming services are just built right into my TV?” Apple TV users go the extra mile to buy the extra box — which isn&#39;t cheap — because they have good taste and want an experience that is superior in all regards: technically, UI-wise, and privacy-wise.</p><p> So it&#39;s not just a random small subset of its users that Netflix is disappointing by refusing to adopt the idiomatic conventions of good tvOS citizenship, it&#39;s the subset of users who care the most, for good reasons. It&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like making a Mac-like Mac app rather than serving Mac users warmed-over cross-platform slop. Or, as MG Siegler put it <a href="https://spyglass.org/netflix-apple-tv/#update">when he updated his post</a> after it turned out this was a rug pull, “Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck. Do these fucking idiots know how stupid this looks and <em>is</em> ?”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Netflix Deeply Regrets Accidentally Making Netflix a Better Product for Its Customers’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/netflix-apple-tv-integration-oopsie">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Financial Times: &#39;Is Corporate America Already Souring on Trump?&#39; </title><link href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7c9376b-4cb2-4cf2-a665-66f75b72f4c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w30" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/15/ft-corporate-america-souring" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41580</id><published> 2025-02-15T17:20:00Z</published><updated> 2025-02-15T22:22:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jay Peters and Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Nearly a month after it was banned in the US, TikTok has returned to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8">App Store for iPhones</a> and other Apple devices as well as the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&amp;e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign">Google Play store</a> for Android phones and tablets.</p><p> The return follows US Attorney General Pam Bondi sending a letter to Apple assuring that it won&#39;t be fined for hosting the app, according to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">which first reported that the app would return</a> .</p></blockquote><p> From Mark Gurman&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">brief report for Bloomberg</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. will restore ByteDance Ltd.&#39;s TikTok to the US App Store on Thursday, following a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m surprised but not shocked by this. But I&#39;d sure like to see what exactly that letter says. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521">PAFACA Act</a> — the law that bans TikTok in the US now that the deadline has passed for ByteDance to sell it to a US company — hasn&#39;t changed or been rescinded, and the current delay in enforcement <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">has no basis in law</a> . Neither Apple nor Google, wisely, have been talking publicly about this at all, but it seems clear that they&#39;ve been acting in concert throughout the process.

<p>Jack Ewing, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> The department&#39;s procurement forecast for 2025, which details purchases the agency expects to make, includes $400 million for armored Tesla vehicles. The document does not specify which Tesla model, but the electric Cybertruck, which has a body of high-strength stainless steel, would be the most suitable vehicle.</p><p> Mr. Musk spent more than $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump, who then appointed him as the leader of a cost-cutting initiative that&#39;s been called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p> The purchase of Cybertrucks, an atypical choice for government armored transport, is likely to raise conflict of interest issues, especially as Mr. Musk trumpets his own efforts to root out what he regards as unnecessary spending.</p></blockquote><p> “Likely to raise” is doing a lot of work there. There&#39;s just no way this is good clean procurement and everyone knows it. Either Musk should run his businesses and have nothing to do with the government or he should defer from accepting any and all government contracts for his businesses. Even someone trying to do this ethically couldn&#39;t manage it; it&#39;s inherently unethical. It&#39;s being reported that this deal started under the Biden administration, which is worth noting, but even if it did, clearly Musk should recuse Tesla from consideration.</p><p> One side is powerless, at the moment, to stop it, and the other side is in the midst of a full-on embrace of partisan corruption as policy. One thing that makes Trump so hard to reckon with is that his graft is right out in the open. He ran a luxury hotel with his fucking name on it two blocks from the White House during his first term, and everyone with business before his administration — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/03/05/tmobile-trump-hotel">like when T-Mobile was trying to get approval for its acquisition of Sprint</a> — knew they were expected to stay there.</p><p> Pre-Trump, it was the “catching” of concealed dealmaking and bribery that signaled corruption being rooted out. But you can&#39;t get “caught” doing something that&#39;s right out in the open. We just have to call it what it is: abject corruption.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> Jimmy Carter&#39;s 2017 op-ed: “ <a href="https://theonion.com/you-people-made-me-give-up-my-peanut-farm-before-i-got-1819585048/">You People Made Me Give Up My Peanut Farm Before I Got To Be President</a> ”.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/g-s1-48571/trump-administration-order-400-million-worth-of-armored-teslas">Bobby Allyn at NPR reports</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The State Department said Thursday it is abandoning plans of purchasing $400 million worth of armored Tesla vehicles after a public document detailing federal contracts for fiscal year 2025 gained wide attention.</p><p> That expected purchase of Teslas, which was slated for September of this year, is now on hold, according to the State Department, which now says it has no plans of fulfilling the contract.</p></blockquote><p> Well then never mind.这里没有腐败。一切都很好。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Quid Pro Cybertruck’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/quid-pro-cybertruck">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Tim Cook, on His Favorite Website, Teases Apple Product Launch Next Week </title><link href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41572</id><published> 2025-02-13T21:30:00Z</published><updated> 2025-02-14T02:14:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Cook, on X:</p><blockquote><p>准备与最新的家庭成员见面。</p><p> Wednesday, February 19. #AppleLaunch</p></blockquote><p> Most people are guessing, I think correctly, that this is about the iPhone SE 4. We&#39;re also right on schedule for the M4 generation of MacBook Airs, but I don&#39;t think MacBook Airs would qualify for “newest member of the family”. They&#39;re more like an updated version of the current member of the family. But the next-gen iPhone SE is going to be a very different iPhone SE — it will mark the end of the Home button and Touch ID. Maybe it won&#39;t even be named “SE” but given a new name?</p><p> The “#AppleLaunch” isn&#39;t merely a hashtag, but a “ <a href="https://creativemarket.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hashflags">Hashflag</a> ” — a paid promotion with X that includes a custom emoji icon. For this one, it&#39;s a shiny liquid-metal treatment of the Apple logo ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/hashflag-applelaunch.png">screenshot</a> ). I don&#39;t know what these “hashflag” promotions cost now, but when they launched a decade ago, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/twitters-branded-emojis-come-million-dollar-commitment-169327/">AdWeek reported that the price started at $1 million</a> . And you&#39;ll never guess who has interrupted his busy day running the federal government <a href="https://x.com/arjunkhemani/status/1890072629207531914">to retweet it</a> .</p><p> I don&#39;t really get Apple&#39;s angle on this return to advertising on X. Placating Trump through flattery and his <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">“inauguration fund” racket</a> , I get. He&#39;s the president of the United States now and he&#39;s nakedly corrupt and such a profound narcissist that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/foreign-leaders-flattery-trump.html">simple abject obsequious flattery</a> works on him. But why appease Musk too? Because Musk has Trump&#39;s ear, I guess? (Feel free to substitute another piece of Trump&#39;s anatomy if you think <em>ear</em> doesn&#39;t properly convey <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/02/07/trump-isnt-going-to-like-this/">their apparent power dynamic</a> — which, in turn, might answer my question re: the need Cook sees to appease Musk.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Cook, on His Favorite Website, Teases Apple Product Launch Next Week’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Account Purchase Migration Doesn&#39;t Transfer TestFlight Enrollments </title><link href="https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991894534107860" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/apple-account-purchase-migration-doesnt-transfer-testflight-enrollments" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41573</id><published> 2025-02-13T21:15:47Z</published><updated> 2025-02-14T16:47:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sean Heber, of The Iconfactory:</p><blockquote><p> It appears that Apple&#39;s new account migration stuff does NOT work for TestFlight access. That by itself is fine - whatever. The problem here is that it appears when someone does an account migration, it kind of half-migrates TestFlight somehow.</p><p> People are telling us their new email address to invite but TestFlight thinks they&#39;re already a tester with that email address! So you can&#39;t just reinvite them. It seems we have to filter for the user, remove them, then add them as a new tester.</p></blockquote><p> Heber subsequently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991948583471243">replied to his own thread</a> :</p><blockquote><p> lol - update. We tried this with a tester. I removed them from TestFlight and then re-added with their new email. They got the invite and then the TestFlight app said they can&#39;t be added because they&#39;re already on TestFlight with the email address that was just invited.</p><p> The workaround was to generate a public TestFlight link and use that. My guess is it uses some kind of token as a key for that system and not their email address. Seems to work around it. Except now there&#39;s a public link. At least I can limit how many can use it and only those who migrated and need a reinvite will get this link for now.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry/113992059015348611">His colleague Craig Hockenberry</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If you&#39;re hearing from testers about being kicked out of TestFlight because of the new account migration stuff, DO NOT update their email. It&#39;s a lot of work and will not help them.</p><p> For now, you MUST give them a public link, even if it&#39;s a private beta.</p></blockquote><p> TestFlight enrollment <em>is</em> on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/113993498493892147">the list of things</a> that you&#39;re warned are not included with migration (the other two are personalized recommendations and the ability to edit App Store reviews you&#39;ve left with your secondary account), but it sounds like the post-migration TestFlight situation is a little worse than just “not migrated, start over”. You need some actual assistance from the developer of each app you&#39;re testing. (I&#39;m an edge case, to be sure, but I&#39;m enrolled in about 30 active TestFlights across Mac and iOS.)</p><p> Still, though, it seems like practical experience with this purchase migration has gone well for almost everyone. I think Apple might have nailed this.</p><p> <strong>Update, 14 February:</strong> Apple has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/14/apple-adds-new-requirement-for-migrating-purchases-between-accounts/">added a new requirement</a> before proceeding with migration:</p><blockquote><p> You can&#39;t migrate purchases if your secondary Apple Account is used with TestFlight for testing beta versions of apps from a developer.

<p>A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_bug">scorebug</a></em> is industry jargon for the sub-genre of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chyron">chyron</a> (itself jargon) that shows ever-present information about a televised sporting event while you&#39;re watching. These graphics display the teams, the score, the time remaining, and other metadata pertaining to the current situation. The current ball/strike count in baseball. The down and yards-to-go in football. The shot clock in basketball. That sort of thing. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-10">1</a></sup></p><p> Fox was the broadcast network for Super Bowl 59 yesterday, in which the Philadelphia Eagles utterly embarrassed the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 (but which felt like a score of 114-0). The NFL rotates the Super Bowl annually between the networks that broadcast games. Fox has a tradition of unveiling updated on-screen graphics packages when it has the Super Bowl. This year, they didn&#39;t just tweak the design, they completely re-thought it and redesigned it.</p><p> First, here&#39;s Fox&#39;s familiar old scorebug, as captured from their broadcast of Super Bowl 57, a game that <em>also</em> pitted the Eagles against the Chiefs two years ago. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-10">2</a></sup></p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-old-2160.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-old-1080.jpeg"
    alt="Screen capture of Fox’s old scorebug, during Super Bowl 57 in 2023."
  /></a></p><p> Here&#39;s the new scorebug they debuted last night, in front of the biggest sports audience of the year:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-new-2160.jpeg" class="noborder"><img
    width = 525

    alt="Screen capture of Fox’s new scorebug, during Super Bowl 59 last night."
  /></a></p><p> I noticed the change immediately (of course), and my knee-jerk instant reaction was negative. <em>Too big, too bold, too different. Don&#39;t like.</em> That&#39;s natural. Human beings evolved to be alarmed by change. If everything looks the same as usual, everything is probably as safe as usual. If something looks jarringly different, it might be a sign that you&#39;re about to be killed. (Evolutionarily speaking.)</p><p> So I started studying and <em>considering</em> the changes to Fox&#39;s scorebug. I quickly not only warmed up to the new scorebug, I decided I <em>really</em> like it. It&#39;s better than Fox&#39;s old one, and better than every other network&#39;s (which all largely look the same), in almost every single regard.</p><p> I like the new scorebug so much I (cross-)posted about it to social media during the game. My posts, in order of engagement: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">Threads</a> (~6,600 likes, ~700 replies and reposts), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">Bluesky</a> (~3,900 likes, ~600 replies and reposts), and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">Mastodon</a> (179 likes, 53 replies and reposts).</p><p> No change an app developer can make will generate more commentary and emotional feedback from users than changing the app&#39;s icon. Everyone sees an app&#39;s icon, and has an opinion about them. That opinion, after a change, is usually “ <em>I like the old icon and hate the new one.</em> ” Likewise with a game broadcast&#39;s scorebug — everyone sees them, and everyone has an opinion when they change. Most reactions to Fox&#39;s new scorebug were negative, and many of those were <em>really</em> negative. Yahoo Sports ran a story under the headline “ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">Super Bowl: Fox Sports Debuts New Scorebug, to Universally Negative Reaction</a> ”. The sports media-focused site Awful Announcing ran a take by Drew Lerner under the headline “ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">Please Stop Debuting New Scorebugs During the Super Bowl</a> ” (subhead: “Can&#39;t I just watch one Super Bowl without having to learn a new graphic?”). I have not even come close to reading all the replies to my social media take (well, except on Mastodon — it was quick to catch up there), but if you peruse them, you&#39;ll be quick to see that most replies are from people who despise the change. A representative tasting:</p><p> “ <em>It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn&#39;t bother having someone check it first.可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “<em>哈哈。 Muted for being a dumbass.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>It&#39;s hideous, and its overbearing size distracts from the actual content of the game.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don&#39;t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.</em>透明</p><p>“Looks like something out of Fortnite” isn&#39;t the dis the last commenter thinks it is. A lot of people play and love Fortnite.</p><p> Here&#39;s an expanded (from what I posted to social media) version of why I like, perhaps even love, the new scorebug. First, the primary items: who&#39;s playing and what&#39;s the score:</p><ul><li> <em>Team initialisms</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Team logos</em> : None. Colors say enough.</li><li> <em>Score</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Game clock</em> : Big enough and centered.</li><li> <em>Needless chrome</em> : None.</li></ul><p> Every team in the league is known by fans by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation of its home location, sort of like airport codes or stock tickers. They&#39;re all obvious ( <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">unlike many</a> airport codes). The Dallas Cowboys are DAL. The New England Patriots are NE. For the two cities which have two teams, New York and Los Angeles, the cities conveniently abbreviate to two letters and a third letter is drawn from the team nicknames: the Giants and Jets are NYG and NYJ; the Rams and Chargers are LAR and LAC.</p><p> Team logos are not as instantly identifiable, especially at small sizes. A bunch of teams have angry bird mascots: Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Cardinals. Do you remember the Tennessee Titans&#39; logo? Or the Houston Texans&#39;? The Cleveland Browns don&#39;t even have a logo to speak of. (And they&#39;re also not brown.) But I guarantee you know which teams are TEN, HOU, and CLE. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p> And, importantly, these team initialisms are not represented by typography alone: they are in a box with the team&#39;s primary color. That use of color does all the branding work necessary, and does it more effectively, at small sizes or viewed from far distances, than the team logos. (One small niggle I have is that the team initialisms are big white letters but are outlined by the team&#39;s secondary color. If you look closely at my screen capture from yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl above, you&#39;ll see that “KC” is outlined in yellow and “PHI” in silver. This has the effect, at a normal viewing distance, of making the initialisms look a little fuzzy. The secondary color outlines are too subtle to have their intended effect of further branding the teams, and instead have the unintended effect of making the text look poorly rendered on screen. I bet Fox tweaks this by next year.)</p><p> The elimination of all needless chrome is arguably the most striking change of all, because Fox&#39;s old scorebug had the most chrome with the most superfluous “3D” styling and textures. This isn&#39;t minimalism, per se, but it&#39;s a strike against needless decoration — reminiscent to my mind of Jony Ive&#39;s radical redesign of iOS 7 a decade ago. Elements that can be conveyed by type and color alone <em>are</em> expressed by type and color alone.</p><p> Other noteworthy features:</p><ul><li><p> <em>Timeouts remaining</em> : Prominent but not distracting. Seeing how many timeouts a team has remaining was a huge problem with Fox&#39;s old scorebug, and with most other networks&#39; current scorebugs. (Remaining timeouts are very important in close football games.)</p></li><li><p> <em>Current down and yards to go indicator (eg “1st &amp; 10”)</em> : Placement atop the team initialism conveys which team has the ball. Fox&#39;s old scorebug did have a “possession” indicator, but scroll back up to look at it, and see how long it takes you to figure out what it is. I&#39;ll put the answer in a footnote. <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p> <em>Typography</em> : Classic, legible, bold, timeless. It is also very “Fox” — the C in “KC” looks like the O in the classic “FOX” wordmark, and the zero (a digit Chiefs fans became very familiar with until the final seconds of the third quarter, because that&#39;s how many points they&#39;d scored until then — the Eagles cycled through a bunch of different digits en route to taking a 34-0 lead) looks pretty much exactly like the uppercase o in “FOX”.</p></li></ul><p> Bigger and bolder typography adds clarity. But removing the background chrome lets viewers “see through” to any game action that happens at the bottom of the screen. To me, after just one game, the old Fox scorebug looks hopelessly dated; old-fashioned without any nostalgic charm. If anything, the new typography-first design is the one that looks timeless, evocative of the graphics from classic NFL Films productions.</p><hr /><p>这是什么。 NFL broadcasts didn&#39;t always have scorebugs. I don&#39;t mean that they had smaller score indicators on screen. I mean they had none at all. This was true for all major sports on TV, not just football (eg the premise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">this gag from <em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a> ). Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials. But while the game played, there was no score on screen. Part of that is technology: game telecasts were low-fidelity over-the-air transmissions to relatively small TV screens that were viewed from across the room. Go back far enough and there wasn&#39;t even color. But a bigger aspect is inertia. Not showing the score at all times was the way games were always broadcast, so it was the way they were still broadcast.</p><p> Then came Fox.</p><p> For decades, there were three major TV networks in the US: ABC, NBC, and CBS. CBS had the Sunday game rights to the superior National Football Conference. “Superior” for the related reasons of team popularity <em>and</em> <a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">team market size</a> , which matters for ratings. Chicago, Philly, Washington, Dallas, Frisco. NBC had the Sunday game rights for the American Football Conference with teams from generally smaller cities. Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Miami. Good teams, but smaller cities. (In 1993, though, NFC teams had won 9 consecutive Super Bowls.)</p><p> Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox network was an attempt — soon enough proven successful — to establish a fourth US network. At the time of their debut in 1987, Fox only had prime time programming on one night a week (Sundays, conveniently). In 1993 Murdoch and Fox upended the world of sports broadcasting by outbidding (stupid, tightfisted, hubristic) CBS for the rights to broadcast the NFC games on Sundays.</p><p> In 2018, Bryan Curtis published at The Ringer a comprehensive oral history of the deal and its consequences: “ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever</a> ”. If this sort of thing interests you at all, read that. It&#39;s a great story, well told.</p><p> But so in 1994 Fox took over the NFC broadcasts. They poached from CBS all the announcers, cameramen, directors, and producers. (CBS didn&#39;t need them anymore, because they had no football games to broadcast.) But while the voices announcing the game were familiar (including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">the best duo ever to do it</a> : John Madden and Pat Summerall), the look and feel of the broadcasts was intentionally new and fresh and, well, because it was Fox, brash. This included an innovation they called the “Fox Box”. Quoting from Curtis&#39;s oral history at The Ringer:</p><blockquote><p> <em>David Hill&#39;s most controversial idea about the NFL was his simplest: He thought the score and clock should have a permanent home on the screen — a feature that became known as the “Fox Box.” A noisy group of critics and rival executives thought the Fox Box was a terrible idea. It would clutter the screen and drive people away from blowouts. But Hill was convinced, because he&#39;d created a proto–Fox Box after a frustrating afternoon watching soccer in the UK</em></p><p> <strong>Hill:</strong> We&#39;d been out walking our dogs. We&#39;d come in, got a cup of tea, and switched the BBC on. I watched the game for a good 15 minutes. I don&#39;t know what the score is. I&#39;m thinking to myself, “Shit, I&#39;d really like to know what the score is.” So I thought, “That&#39;s easy. On a chyron, I&#39;ll just put it up in the corner.” So I did it.</p><p> <strong>Madden:</strong> Instead of saying, “No, that&#39;s a stupid idea, we got other things we have to do,” he said, “If the score and the time is the most important thing, why don&#39;t we just put it up and leave it there?” That&#39;s where the Fox Box came from. That was David Hill.</p><p> <strong>Dolgin:</strong> All the networks told us, “You&#39;re screwing this up. You&#39;re idiots to do this.”</p><p> <strong>Albert:</strong> The thought was, some networks won&#39;t leave the time and score up because it&#39;s a blowout and they didn&#39;t want you to <em>know</em> it&#39;s a blowout.</p></blockquote><p> The “Fox Box” idea wasn&#39;t just controversial, it was widely panned as stupid. The networks literally thought it would be better if many viewers didn&#39;t know the score. And when the Fox Box appeared, many critics agreed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">Dan Cox&#39;s review of Fox&#39;s opening week broadcast for Variety</a> , in September 1994:</p><blockquote><p> The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game. Fox Sports prexy David Hill has said it&#39;s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.</p><p>好吧，是的。 But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p></blockquote><p> Who seems stupid now? Imagine the outcry if Fox had broadcast yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl without any scorebug at all — you know, for those who would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business. Smokers want to smoke and would stay home if they couldn&#39;t, the argument went. Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better. But better necessarily implies different.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-10"><p> You know how when you&#39;re watching most TV channels — not just sports, but any sort of show at all — they keep a logo for the channel in one of the corners of the screen? Those omnipresent logos are called <em>bugs</em> (perhaps because everyone knows they&#39;re slightly annoying?). Hence: scorebug for an always-present score indicator. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-10"><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF Style Guide</a> has no entry for “Roman numerals” because no obscenities or expletives are strong enough to convey the policy. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-10"><p> The one matchup this design might not work great for would be a Rams-Chargers game, because in addition to sharing a city (and stadium), they even share the same team colors: blue and yellow.

It&#39;s solvable — <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrbiggs.bsky.social/post/3lhvsptivlk2z">here are some examples with different color treatments</a> from a similar scorebug for the English Premier League.

<p>Well, the Philadelphia Eagles, of course, won the actual Super Bowl, winning in a romp so one-sided that they would have embarrassed the Chiefs <em>less</em> if they had pantsed Patrick Mahomes at the 50-yard line. But the second contest is for best commercial. And my vote goes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">to Nike</a> .</p><p> The problem with modern Super Bowl commercials is they&#39;re bland. Offensively bland. It really makes no sense to me. The commercial time is famously expensive — Fox was supposedly selling 30-second spots for last night&#39;s game for $8 million — but the sponsors who buy that time tend to squander it with absolute mindless pap.</p><p> Fewer and fewer sponsors each year, it seems, attempt to bring something actually interesting.不同的东西。 Something with some punch. Something that&#39;s <em>actually</em> funny. Something that makes you actually <em>feel</em> . You don&#39;t have to make a genuinely artistic short film, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I">Apple&#39;s Ridley-Scott-directed <em>1984</em> spot</a> heralding the introduction of the Macintosh — the ad that is justifiably regarded as the best commercial ever made. Some of what I&#39;d list among the best Super Bowl ads ever were silly gimmicks that revelled in their abject silliness, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Bowl">the “Bud Bowl” commercials</a> (featuring anthropomorphic bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light playing football) — very far from “high art” but very fun, and created specifically to be shown once and only once, in the context of the Super Bowl. One simple measure is whether the ads are memorable. Most of the ads in last night&#39;s game I forgot by the time the game resumed after the break.</p><p> I don&#39;t know why anyone would book and commission a Super Bowl commercial if they weren&#39;t trying to <em>do</em> something or <em>say</em> something memorable with the spot. Still, though, there are always at least a handful of standouts.</p><p> My favorite yesterday was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">Nike&#39;s “So Win” spot</a> , a heralding of its own — not for a new Nike product, but for the explosion in interest in women&#39;s sports, featuring WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark and a few other top women&#39;s athletes. Gorgeous black and white cinematography. Led Zeppelin&#39;s rollicking “ <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whole-lotta-love/580708374?i=580708471">Whole Lotta Love</a> ” as the soundtrack. And a righteous manifesto of a message, delivered with pitch-perfect gusto by narrator Doechii. Nike, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/nikes-super-bowl-ad-puts-women-athletes-center-stage-on-a-male-dominated-field/">it turns out</a> , hadn&#39;t run a Super Bowl ad since 1998, and they came back with a banger that to me reinvigorated the Nike brand. They&#39;ve been in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/former-nike-ceo-john-donahoe-leadership-lessons-choosing-ceo/">a bit of a free fall</a> and I think this ad was intended as much to inspire Nike employees as it was to female athletes and sports fans. (Shades of Apple&#39;s “Think Different” campaign.) I&#39;ve re-watched this spot a few times while writing this post and I like it more each time.</p><p> Honorable mentions:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/608476/openai-super-bowl-chatgpt-commercial">ChatGPT&#39;s branding spot</a> , positioning AI alongside historical breakthroughs in technology.喜欢它。 I think it was supposed to be a mystery until the very end of the 60-second spot who the ad was for and what exactly it was about, but I guessed “ChatGPT” about 5 seconds in. I kind of hate making a third comparison to an old Apple ad, but ChatGPT&#39;s spot does evoke — not as a rip-off, but homage — the 90-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAEPqUtra6E">“There are a thousand no&#39;s for every yes” opening film from WWDC 2013</a> , perhaps the nadir of Apple&#39;s post-Steve-Jobs grief.</li><li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoeGC-eL4I">Stella Artois</a> : David Beckham learns that he has a twin brother, named Other David Beckham, whom his parents abandoned at birth in America. Beckham sets off to meet him. Don&#39;t read anything more about it, just watch. Good kicker at the end, too.</li></ul><p> Dishonorable mention:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi</a> is a streaming platform owned by Fox. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Apparently</a> it&#39;s existed since 2014 and has been owned by Fox since 2020, but I&#39;d forgotten it existed until this week, when it was in the news as the streaming platform carrying the Super Bowl. Fox ran a couple of house ads, intended to promote Tubi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMDrZDhxWBs">about a young man born with a head shaped like a cowboy hat</a> . Memorable, yes, but the execution was revolting, not funny. The message I took was that Tubi is the streaming app that will make you feel grossed out.</li></ul> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nike&#39;s &#39;So Win&#39; Won the Super Bowl</title></entry><entry><link href="https://go.clerk.com/2n40MWr" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2f" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/02/clerk_--_complete_user_managem" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41559</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-02-10T22:04:37Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T22:04:38Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
