<p>这是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">我昨天在App Store中通常稳定的“顶级免费下载”列表上的重新介绍的帖子</a>附录。一些改组来自新进入者，例如备受瞩目的AI聊天机器人DeepSeek。但是，其中很多是突然缺乏bondedance的全部应用程序阵容的直接结果：tiktok，capcut，lemon8和Marvel Snap。替代方案正在争夺这些空隙。 [<strong>更新，一天后：</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/marvel-snap-returns-to-app-store/">Marvel Snap又回到了App Store中</a>，因为它现在有一个新发布者。]</p><p>蒂克托克（Tiktok）<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">仅一天停电后</a>返回美国的运营服务，使围绕其禁令的愤怒感到震惊。该应用程序停止工作； Tiktok用户没有为禁令做好准备，吓坏了；该应用第二天再次开始工作。 Tiktok粉丝或多或少地回去滚动他们的供稿并闭嘴。争议。</p><p>但是争议不应该结束。除非发生变化，否则它将慢慢地煮至最终的沸腾。</p><p>没有人真正在谈论这样一个事实，即从法律上讲，在美国，在美国现在在美国被禁止使用，并且已经安装的应用程序的副本只是在继续起作用，因为Tiktok的美国云提供商Oracle和Akamai在Word上还原了服务。特朗普总统在说<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">，尽管明显违反了《帕法卡法》</a> ，但他们不会为此负责。但是，Apple和Google均未将任何Bontedance的应用程序恢复到App Store或Play Store。这并没有干扰Tiktok通过已经安装在用户手机上的应用程序的副本返回操作，但从长远来看，这是一个无法克服的（尽管增量）。</p><p>传统的观点是，Oracle和Akamai有点鲁ck（“<em>如果特朗普说我们很好，我们很好 - 可能出了什么问题，这并不像特朗普曾经改变了主意……</em> ”），苹果和苹果Google是审慎的，更稳定的（“<em>我们遵循法律的信，将继续遵守法律的信</em>”）。也许这就是这一切。但是，既然我们已经到了这个后期的一周了，那么我开始怀疑这四家公司沿着这些界限而分裂的巧合是否纯粹是巧合。 Tiktok需要在一侧运行的两个云提供商，另一个App Store提供商在另一侧。</p><p>随着Tiktok的Cloud Provider访问的关闭，就像断头台。蒂克托克（Tiktok）为美国的每个人都工作，然后繁荣，每个人都关闭了。然后，突然之间，它回来了。</p><p>另一方面，被锁定在App Store和Play商店的情况下是一个缓慢的挤压。显然，想到的第一件事不是新用户。没有增长。 TikTok already has a mind-boggling number of users in the US (estimates seem to range from 120 to 170 million), but no growth is no growth.</p><p> The second thing that comes to mind is no app updates for US users.没有新功能。 No bug fixes. No security patches. TikTok, like most popular apps, typically pushes updates to the App Store and Play Store every two or three weeks. What happens now that that&#39;s stopped for US users? Is ByteDance still going to push app updates to users in the rest of the world? TikTok obviously has a lot of American users but <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/data-drop-5-charts-on-tiktoks-growth-asia-pacific"><em>most</em> of its users live elsewhere</a> .</p><p> But the third factor is the most insidious: even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user&#39;s phone continues to function, that user can&#39;t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance&#39;s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores. Wipe and restore your phone from backup? No more TikTok. Buy a new phone? No TikTok on the new phone.</p><p> Trump&#39;s reprieve was a declaration that the Justice Department wouldn&#39;t enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance doesn&#39;t sell TikTok — and it sure doesn&#39;t seem like they have any more intention to sell it now than they did before the ban took effect — what happens? <em>Another</em> (even more shambolically illegal) Trump extension that only keeps TikTok functioning, but not available in the app stores? Because the other side isn&#39;t budging either: China hawks like Senator Tom Cotton <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/speeches/icymi-cotton-objects-to-tiktok-ban-extension">have not shifted an inch</a> . They&#39;re tolerating Trump&#39;s 75-day reprieve but not budging from their overall “sell or you&#39;re banned” stance.</p><p> I&#39;m not saying this is a backroom plot between the administration and these companies, but I&#39;m not saying it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a backroom agreement either. Trump isn&#39;t complaining about Apple and Google not getting on board. And neither Apple nor Google seems worried about Trump&#39;s wrath for not following Oracle and Akamai&#39;s leads. The goal of the legislation isn&#39;t to pull the plug on TikTok for Americans — it&#39;s to pressure ByteDance (and really, their bosses in the Chinese Communist Party) into selling the app. Instantly banning TikTok&#39;s US operations resulted in instant and vociferous outrage from TikTok users — the pressure turned out not to be on ByteDance and the CCP, it was on the US government to give people back their beloved TikTok. So I think everyone on the US side is looking at the current detente — TikTok being available to existing users through existing copies of the app, but not being available in app stores — as a way to turn the pressure up only on ByteDance. Slowly strangle TikTok over a period of months, rather than behead it overnight.</p><p> But what happens if the CCP stands pat? If they just wait it out? If ByteDance were a normal company they&#39;d face financial pressure to capitulate and sell. But the CCP isn&#39;t under any financial pressure to allow ByteDance to sell. Say what you will about the Chinese government, but they do not lack for patience. What happens then, when word starts spreading amongst TikTok fans not to upgrade their phones, lest they lose access to the app? Apple&#39;s going to have some strong feelings about that.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ My Spitball Theory on TikTok&#39;s Current Semi-Reprieve in the US</title></entry><entry><title> Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to &#39;Gulf of America&#39;, for American Users Only </title><link href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41526</id><published> 2025-01-29T01:00:22Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T22:12:57Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Google, in an announcement on X:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.</p><p> For geographic features in the US, this is when <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) is updated. When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the US quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.</p><p> Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-reclassifies-us-as-sensitive-country-like-china-russia-.html">Jennifer Elias, reporting for CNBC</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google&#39;s maps division on Monday reclassified the US as a “sensitive country,” a designation it reserves for states with strict governments and border disputes, CNBC has learned. [...]</p><p> Some team members within the maps division were ordered to urgently make changes to the location name and recategorize the US from “non-sensitive” to “sensitive,” according to the internal correspondence. The changes were given a rare “P0” order, meaning it had the highest priority level and employees were immediately notified and instructed to drop what they were doing to work on it.</p><p> Google&#39;s order states that the Gulf of America title change should be treated similar to the Persian Gulf, which in Arab countries is displayed on Google Maps as Arabian Gulf.</p></blockquote><p> No word from Apple on how Apple Maps will handle this. (I&#39;ve asked for comment; will update if I get an answer.) Re-renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley seems like a no-brainer for the maps to comply with. A country names its own mountains. If Obama could rename it, Trump can re-rename it.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico, though, is an international body of water, and its name wasn&#39;t even debated until Trump started talking about it a few weeks ago. Google (and perhaps Apple) having a policy where they simply follow the naming conventions of the GNIS seems not merely sensible but utterly uncontroversial ... until now.</p><p> There are three countries in the world that don&#39;t use the metric system as their official units of measure: the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar. I expect there will be fewer — namely, one — who go along with calling it the “Gulf of America”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to ‘Gulf of America’, for American Users Only’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/openvibe" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1g" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41524</id><published> 2025-01-28T21:34:37Z</published><updated> 2025-01-30T22:53:47Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Openvibe, which mashes together multiple accounts from mulitple networks into a single timeline, is interesting, but not for me — and I&#39;m not really sure who it *is* for. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sarah Perez, TechCrunch “ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/automattic-and-others-back-openvibe-an-app-thats-unifying-the-open-social-web/">Automattic and Others Back Openvibe, an App That&#39;s Unifying the Open Social Web</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/openvibe-combines-mastodon-bluesky-and-nostr-into-one-social-app/">Launched in 2024</a> , Openvibe initially supported three of the more prominent open social networks, all of which operate using different protocols: Mastodon uses ActivityPub, Bluesky runs on AT Protocol, and Nostr powers a number of third-party apps. Openvibe later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/cross-posting-social-app-openvibe-now-supports-threads-too/">added support for Instagram Threads</a> , as that app became further integrated with ActivityPub and opened itself up to the developer community.</p><p> As CEO Matej Svancer explained at the time, the idea behind his app was to offer users a more friendly and “easy-to-use gateway” to the open social web. Because of the different protocols these networks utilize, it can be difficult for newcomers who end up having to switch apps or limit their engagement to just their preferred platform.</p><p> But Openvibe doesn&#39;t just let people stay connected with friends across all these services in a combined timeline, it also allows cross-posting to multiple networks at once.</p></blockquote><p> I just gave it a try, and my take is that <a href="https://openvibe.social/">Openvibe</a> is definitely interesting, but it&#39;s not for me, and I&#39;m not really sure who it <em>is</em> for. I signed into all three of my personal accounts that Openvibe supposedly supports: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo">Bluesky</a> , <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">Mastodon</a> , and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber">Threads</a> . I got a home timeline that mashes together all the posts from my Bluesky and Mastodon accounts. I don&#39;t see any errors related to Threads, but I don&#39;t see any posts from Threads. That kind of makes sense because Threads doesn&#39;t offer an API that allows for full third-party clients. Threads does have an API for posting, so I presume my Threads account in Openvibe is write-only. Openvibe&#39;s website and the app itself make it seem like I should see content from my Threads timeline, though. (Perhaps I don&#39;t because <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113635727167100815">I turned off “fediverse sharing”</a> with my Threads account a few weeks ago — <em>because</em> I prefer keeping these networks separate. But if that&#39;s the problem, Openvibe doesn&#39;t explain that I need to re-enable it ）</p><p> I really don&#39;t see the point of mashing the tweets from two (or more!) different social networks into one unified timeline. To me it&#39;s just confusing. I don&#39;t love the current situation where three entirely separate, thriving social networks each merit some portion of my attention (not to mention that a fourth, X, still kinda does too). But when I use each of these platforms, I want to use a client that is dedicated to each platform. These platforms all have different features, to varying degrees, and they definitely have different vibes and cultural norms. Pretending that they all form one big (lowercase-m) meta platform doesn&#39;t make that pretense cohesive. Mashing them all together in one timeline isn&#39;t simpler. It <em>sounds</em> simpler but in practice it&#39;s more cacophonous.</p><p> The idea that this might in any way appeal to “newcomers” is bananas to me. The concept of streaming multiple accounts from multiple networks into one timeline is by definition a bit advanced. In my experience, for very obvious reasons, casual social network users only use the first-party client. They&#39;re confused even by the idea of using, say, an app named <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> to access a social network called Mastodon. The idea of explaining to them why they might want to use an app named Openvibe to access Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads (and the weirdo blockchain network Nostr) is like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dwread/32464548110">trying to explain to your dog why they should stay out of the trash</a> . There&#39;s a market for third-party clients (or at least I hope there is), but that market is not made up of “newcomers”.</p><p> Also, Openvibe is not a good app. It doesn&#39;t look great, the custom font is somewhat cartoon-y (which I find both unattractive and off-putting), there&#39;s a lot of gray-on-white low-contrast iconography and text, and, worst of all, it seems to update your feeds periodically and when it does, it refreshes and scrolls the timeline <em>while you&#39;re looking at it</em> . It&#39;s like having a book turn the page automatically while you&#39;re reading in the middle of a page. When you leave and come back to the app a few minutes later, the timeline needs to reload, which contributes to the app feeling pretty slow. The overall look, feel, and layout says “generic Twitter-style social network”.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/openvibe-screenshot.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

  /></a></p><p> I do use and very much see the point of <a href="https://croissantapp.com/">Croissant</a> , a multi-network app for <em>cross-posting</em> to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky. Croissant isn&#39;t a client for consuming content from those platforms; it&#39;s just a tool for sending new posts <em>to</em> those platforms.</p><p> And I&#39;d love it if Tapbots&#39;s aforementioned Ivory added support for Bluesky accounts. But when I use Ivory (as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">when I used Tweetbot</a> , for years, before it), I don&#39;t see — and wouldn&#39;t want to see — a single timeline from all configured accounts. I want to switch between multiple accounts, each with their own discrete timelines. Openvibe is in many ways the opposite of Ivory, starting right from its slogan: “All decentralised social networks, single timeline”.</p><p> <strong>Addendum, 30 January 2025:</strong> I never got far enough with Openvibe to grant it permission to send me notifications, <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@0xC0FFEE/113919087229728133">but Kim Slawson did</a> , and Openvibe&#39;s notifications are borderline useless. Rather than tell you anything useful about the posts you&#39;re being notified about — you know, like what they say, or who posted them — they all just say “🔔 New notification is waiting for you!” So useless it&#39;s amazing.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★OpenVibe，Bluesky，Mastodon，Threads（据说）和NoStr的多社会网络应用程序</title></entry><entry><title>iOS 18.3和MacOS 15.3都出了</title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-now-available-new-features/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-macos-15-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41523</id><published> 2025-01-28T19:26:02Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T00:26:11Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass:</p><blockquote><p> Anyway, this matters because it doesn&#39;t mean that DeepSeek, an app based off of the Chinese-developed AI model of the same name, is the most popular app ever despite its current place atop the charts. Your mom probably isn&#39;t downloading it. Just as last week, your mom probably wasn&#39;t <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-042-tiktok-twitter/#:~:text=%2D%2D%20Candacce%2C,in%20social%20media.">downloading Xiaohongshu</a> (&#39; <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-043-bromo-sapiens/#:~:text=%F0%9F%95%9A%20TikTok%20Prepares,%3F%20%5BInformation%20%F0%9F%94%92%5D">Little Red Book</a> &#39;), incidentally another Chinese app that rose to the top of the charts. But it is still interesting because again, the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure, new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right now, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from Google (Google) in the top 10.</p><p> Instead, we have the aforementioned DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Paramount+, Temu, Fox Sports, Bluesky, ReelShort, and VPN rounding out the top 10. It&#39;s pretty easy to see why each of these has risen: interest in AI, interest in sports around the NFL playoffs, interest in Twitter-like social networks given <a href="https://spyglass.org/a-time-to-kill-twitter/">the Xitter situation</a> , and yes, <a href="https://spyglass.org/twittertok/">the TikTok ban</a> .</p></blockquote><p> The specific reasons are varied, but altogether it really is true that, for the moment at least, there&#39;s a serious shakeup atop the App Store top free downloads list. That&#39;s interesting for several reasons.</p><p> DeepSeek is at #1 and ChatGPT #2. That&#39;s great for “AI” but a bad look for OpenAI at the moment. I can&#39;t help but think that DeepSeek having rocketed to the top spot, seemingly ( <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1226">but not actually</a> ) out of nowhere helped drive today&#39;s stock market reaction. (Google Gemini is down at #14.)</p><p> Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple&#39;s strength in AI. Sure, Apple&#39;s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">pretty embarrassing</a> right now, even <em>with</em> its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson&#39;s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/wwdc-apple-intelligence-apple-aggregates-ai/">reinforces Apple&#39;s role as an aggregator of AI</a> . The measuring stick for consumer AI products <em>and</em> public social media networks is where they&#39;re listed on the App Store. Not app stores, lowercase. <em>The</em> App Store. Apple&#39;s. That&#39;s The Show, the Major Leagues. So sure, it&#39;d be better for Apple users and Apple shareholders, and thus better for Apple itself, if Apple&#39;s own AI was at least sort of kind of competitive, rather than the butt of jokes. Aside from the easily forgotten iTunes Ping 15 years ago, Apple hasn&#39;t even <em>tried</em> to offer its own public broadcast-style social media platform. But the iPhone is <em>the</em> place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn&#39;t matter if Comcast&#39;s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut.</p><p> Lastly, when it comes to Meta: Threads is #3 (the people arguing that Threads is a bust sure are quiet lately), Instagram is down to #16 (not great if they were hoping for a bounce from TikTok&#39;s questionable future), WhatsApp #17 (not bad on iOS in the US, where iMessage is strongest) and Facebook is ... scroll, scroll, scroll ... #32, just behind Walmart and Microsoft Teams. 32 isn&#39;t that far ahead of X, which clocks in at #41. Facebook might never die, but we seem to be watching it fade away.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Shakeup in the App Store Top Downloads List’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CNBC: &#39;Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China&#39;s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off&#39; </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-chinas-deepseek-triggers-global-tech-sell-off.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41519</id><published> 2025-01-27T22:15:20Z</published><updated> 2025-01-28T16:51:36Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jenni Reid and Alex Harring, reporting for CNBC:</p><blockquote><p> Nvidia and other US technology firms plunged on Monday, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America&#39;s leadership in the sector.</p><p> Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, last slid 17.3%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020.</p></blockquote><p> To make a long story short, it&#39;s been broadly assumed that leading-edge model training <em>and</em> inference requires the highest of high-end hardware — which hardware, especially for training, pretty much exclusively comes from Nvidia. The assumption was that any company trying to compete in this fiercely competitive field — a field with massive implications for industry, culture, and national security — must get in line to buy (or rent) enormous amounts of computational power exclusively available on the very best systems from Nvidia. That hardware isn&#39;t available (at least legally) to Chinese companies, because of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/u-s-targets-china-with-new-ai-curbs-overriding-nvidias-objections-d1e06807">the Biden administration&#39;s export bans</a> . DeepSeek engineers found and implemented multiple massive efficiency improvements that allowed the company to train its latest models at far lower prices using far-less-capable hardware, and perform <a href="https://www.vectara.com/glossary-of-llm-terms#llm-inference">inference</a> under heretofore unprecedented memory constraints. DeepSeek&#39;s achievements render obsolete several prior planks of conventional wisdom regarding the state of AI. My link a few sentences prior in this paragraph is to a WSJ report from 14 days ago that now feels like it dates from at least 14 <em>months</em> ago.</p><p> The most shocking result has been a 17 percent hit to Nvidia&#39;s stock price today, knocking somewhere around $350 <em>billion</em> off their market cap. Google is down about 4 percent, and Microsoft down 2 percent — but Meta is up 1 percent and Apple is up a little over 3 percent. I think the market is reacting pretty sensibly:</p><ul><li><p> Nvidia has taken an unprecedented beating. $350 billion is more than the combined market caps of Verizon <em>and</em> AT&amp;T (each worth roughly $170 billion). But Nvidia has been — and even with these breakthroughs from DeepSeek, remains — in an unprecedented position. Nvidia&#39;s high-flying valuation reflects its unprecedented position as <em>the</em> essential hardware company for AI. Nvidia&#39;s position, post-R1, remains essential — just not <em>as</em> essential as everyone thought. Hence the haircut. But Nvidia <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">remains</a> the third-most-valuable company in the world — it took a massive plunge today but in no way collapsed.</p></li><li><p> TSMC and Broadcom both took big hits today too (-13% and -17%, respectively). Being a “chip company” doesn&#39;t look as sweet today as it did last week.</p></li><li><p> If OpenAI were publicly traded, I suspect it might have collapsed — the sell-off it would have faced today might have triggered emergency measures that halted trading.</p></li><li><p> Microsoft has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/">distancing itself from OpenAI</a> , but is still intertwined with them like no other company. (Recall that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/28/wsj-openai-apple">Apple walked away from a big investment in OpenAI</a> just four months ago.) A -2% hit feels about right.</p></li><li><p> The broadest implication of DeepSeek&#39;s achievements is that really good AI is going to be even cheaper and more openly available than expected — sooner than expected. That&#39;s bad news for Google, whose entire enterprise value is based around their having an unassailable and sustainable lead in these areas. Google doesn&#39;t have to worry about <em>a</em> competitor coming along to rival them in search. They have to worry that the entire field of “search” is on the cusp of being commoditized. Thus the -4% hit.</p></li><li><p> Meta, the thinking goes, benefits as generative AI becomes cheaper. That&#39;s why Meta&#39;s own AI efforts are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40078025">sorta-kinda open source</a> . Meta has nothing to do with DeepSeek, but DeepSeek&#39;s achievements seem perfectly aligned with Meta&#39;s own interests in AI.</p></li><li><p> Apple benefits, indirectly, in at least two ways from DeepSeek&#39;s breakthroughs. First, a vast increase in the inference capabilities of RAM-constrained hardware strongly suggests that Apple&#39;s consumer devices will soon be able to perform far more AI computation locally. Apple Silicon&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686">shared memory architecture</a> is perfect for this — and still un-replicated by anyone else in the industry. Second, Apple&#39;s decades-long <a href="https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/10/13/apple-vs-nvidia-what-happened.html">standoffish relationship with Nvidia</a> suddenly looks like less of a problem.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘CNBC: ‘Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China’s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Ben Thompson&#39;s DeepSeek FAQ </title><link href="https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41518</id><published> 2025-01-27T21:19:29Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T21:45:54Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese AI lab DeepSeek <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/">made waves last week</a> when they dropped their new “open reasoning” LLM named R1. But over the weekend the full repercussions of their achievements (plural) began to sink in across the industry. My partner-in-Dithering Ben Thompson has written an extraordinarily helpful FAQ-style explanation at Stratechery today. If you, like me, were looking at the news today and thinking “Jeebus what the hell is going on with this DeepSeek thing?”, read Thompson&#39;s piece first. Two choice excerpts, first regarding OpenAI:</p><blockquote><p> R1 is notable, however, because o1 stood alone as the only reasoning model on the market, and the clearest sign that OpenAI was the market leader.</p><p> R1以几种重要的方式撤消了O1神话。首先，它存在的事实。 Openai没有某种无法复制的特殊酱汁。其次，R1（与DeepSeek的所有模型一样）具有开放权重（说“开源”的问题是我们没有创建它的数据）。这意味着，您可以在选择的服务器上甚至在本地以较低的成本在选择的服务器上运行R1，而不是支付OpenAi来获得推理。</p></blockquote><p> Second, regarding DeepSeek&#39;s use of <a href="https://snorkel.ai/blog/llm-distillation-demystified-a-complete-guide/">distillation</a> (using existing LLMs to train new smaller ones):</p><blockquote><p> Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves. We are watching the assembly of an AI takeoff scenario in realtime.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ben Thompson’s DeepSeek FAQ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Removes &#39;2024&#39; Timeframe From Next-Generation CarPlay Page </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-removes-2024-from-next-gen-carplay-page/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41517</id><published> 2025-01-27T16:58:16Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T16:58:17Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Dominic Preston, writing for The Verge, “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347690/oppo-find-n5-oneplus-open-2-thinnest-usb-c-ipx9">Oppo&#39;s Next Foldable Is About as Thin as USB-C Allows”</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Oppo has been steadily teasing the Find N5 on Chinese social network Weibo for the past week. Find series product manager Zhou Yibao has now <a href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/Pako9ofOQ">shared photos</a> that highlight its size, adding that the obstacle to making it any thinner is now “the limit of the charging port.” [...]</p><p> The company claims the Find N5 is the thinnest foldable yet. That title is currently held by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235231/honor-magic-v3-thin-foldable-europe-launch">Honor Magic V3</a> , which is 4.35mm thick when open, meaning the Find N5 must be close to 4mm. That explains why it looks about half the size of the 8.25mm iPhone 16 Pro Max it&#39;s shown next to in the photos. For reference, a USB-C port is 2.6mm at minimum.</p></blockquote><p> I see four possible futures:</p><p> (a) We never see phones thinner than 4mm, and USB-C will be with us forever.</p><p> (b) When we start getting phones thinner than USB-C allows, they abandon plug-in ports entirely and move exclusively to inductive connections (eg MagSafe) for both charging and data.</p><p> (c) One or more companies — most likely Apple — devises a proprietary charging and data port that is significantly thinner than USB-C.</p><p> (d) The USB Consortium devises an industry-standard, significantly thinner successor to the USB-C connector, and the EU swiftly updates its regulations to allow it as an alternative to USB-C.</p><p> Option (a) strikes me as guaranteed wrong. We will, sooner or later, see phones that are too thin for a USB-C port.唯一的问题是何时。</p><p> Option (b) seems entirely plausible for consumer-targeted devices, but the literally <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">professional-caliber video features</a> enabled in iPhone Pro models with USB-C ports would be impossible, at the moment, to offer via any existent inductive connector. Because of the ubiquity of USB, no one has even tried establishing a inductive connector for high-speed data transfer. Data transfer could be the limiting factor that keeps professional phones on USB-C for the near future, but the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108361">Smart Connector</a> on the back of recent iPad models handles both charging and data (albeit low-speed data transfer, intended only for trackpad and keyboard输入）。 The thinnest-ever <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">iPhone 17 “Air” model that&#39;s much-rumored for this September</a> is expected <em>alongside</em> iPhone 17 Pro models, not <em>in place</em> of them. If it proves popular I could see a near future where the iPhone “Air” drops its USB-C port and goes MagSafe-only for charging, with all data transfer taking place wirelessly (meaning over the air, via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), while the iPhone Pro models, with thicker batteries and both more and better cameras, keep their USB-C ports for a few additional years, until they too go inductive-charging exclusive, perhaps with a breakthrough magnetic Smart Connector that supports high-speed data transfer. I suspect this is the path we&#39;ll see that delivers too-thin-for-USB-C-port phones and tablets. And I believe it would neatly remain within the EU&#39;s charging port regulations, but would irritate proponents of those regulations, because it&#39;s unlikely Apple would choose to make such a Super Smart Connector an open standard. (The EU USB-C mandate applies only to charging <em>ports</em> , which is why Apple Watches, to name one prominent example of a device that charges only inductively, via a proprietary connector, remain available there.)</p><p> Option (c), of course, would be disallowed in the EU, meaning such phones either wouldn&#39;t be sold in the EU, or the company that made them (which, let&#39;s face it, would be Apple) would need to make different models for sale in the EU that omit the proprietary port and charge only via MagSafe/Qi. My spidey-sense says this just isn&#39;t worth working on, and thus won&#39;t happen. I can imagine a port and connector that are thinner than USB-C — something that looks like Lightning, but thinner — but to maintain any sort of structural rigidity, it couldn&#39;t be <em>that</em> much thinner than USB-C, and thus wouldn&#39;t enable the creation of phones or tablets that are <em>that</em> much thinner than USB-C ports allow. What I can imagine are phones and tablets that are more like credit cards in thickness. But there are so many engineering challenges that need to be solved to get there — battery technology, display technology, chip efficiency, and probably a dozen more.</p><p> Option (d) makes me laugh just thinking about it.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★薄</title></entry><entry><title>杰西卡·莱辛（Jessica Lessin）2014年的金·沃拉斯（Kim Vorrath） </title><link href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-s-software-taskmaster-faces-tough-test?rc=jfy0lk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w15" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/lessin-vorrath" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41513</id><published> 2025-01-25T01:27:49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-25T16:50:27Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

[...]</p><p> ICE agents entered the Ocean Food Depot restaurant where owner Luis Janota said around a dozen immigration authorities detained three people after receiving a complaint, PIX11 News in New York reports.</p><p> “我问[代理商]他们正在寻找什么文件，他们说这是许可证或护照。 I thought, who walks around with a passport?” Janota told the station.贾诺塔（Janota）说，在受到质疑的工人中，这家餐厅的仓库经理是波多黎各人和退伍军人。波多黎各人是美国公民。</p><p> “在我看来，他们是在专门追随某些人 - 不是每种人，因为他们没有要求我提供文件或我的美国工人，葡萄牙工人或白人工人。”</p></blockquote><p> That these raids are beginning and will surely escalate is no surprise. Trump campaigned heavily on the promise of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. This is an issue where he&#39;s doing what he said he&#39;d do.</p><p> But there&#39;s an obvious aspect of <em>where</em> these raids are taking place that isn&#39;t being talked about enough.在竞选期间，特朗普广泛答应将所有“它们”驱逐出境。 Even as recently as December he told NBC News&#39;s Kristen Welker, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-interview-meet-press-kristen-welker-election-president-rcna182857">in an interview on Meet the Press</a> , that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-aims-deport-all-immigrants-us-illegally-2024-12-08/">his aim was to deport <em>all</em> undocumented immigrants in the US</a> .</p><p> The raids are taking place in deep blue cities in blue states.这些地方反对特朗普。纽瓦克的人们没有为此投票。 People in <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/01/24/chicago-schools-block-immigration-agents/">Chicago</a> , Philadelphia, New York, and Boston didn&#39;t vote for this. If this was really about following through on the popular demand of the voters who elected Trump, who see undocumented immigrants as a scourge on their communities, wouldn&#39;t these raids focus on the states that voted for Trump — like, say, Texas and Arizona ，哪个实际上在墨西哥接壤？</p><p> <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/10/16/do-conservatives-really-have-an-empathy-deficit-this-is-what-social-science-says/">本质上更加善解人意的</a>自由主义者倾向于关注移民执法的直接人为损失。 Adam Serwer&#39;s 2018 essay for The Atlantic is, if anything, more relevant today than when he wrote it: “ <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/">The Cruelty Is the Point</a> ”. （副总统：“特朗普总统和他的支持者通过对他们讨厌和恐惧的人的苦难感到高兴。”此外，塞尔沃<a href="https://amzn.to/4jyRXr5">（</a> Serwer trouble looking past the heartbreak of these raids.</p><p> But the second-order effect of widespread deportations will be economic. Undocumented workers make up <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/mobilizing-against-inequality/post/five-ways-undocumented-immigrants-are-powering-american-economy">a remarkably large sector of the US economy</a> . The economic effects of mass deportations will be local, directly affecting the communities and cities where the deportations occur. Focusing these ICE raids on blue cities in blue states, is, first and foremost, an attack on these immigrants themselves and their families and friends. But if, as I expect they will, the raids mostly or exclusively take place in Democratic cities and communities in Democratic states, it&#39;s a de facto economic attack on blue states.</p><p> Trump voters in red states will get to enjoy watching footage of the raids on TV and social media, but it won&#39;t be <em>their</em> neighbors getting deported, not <em>their</em> contractors and custodians and dishwashers, and it won&#39;t be <em>their</em> communities whose economies suffer因此。 It&#39;s seemingly impractical operationally and would be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/politics/border-czar-homan-trump-deportation-plans/index.html">ruinous economically</a> for the Trump administration to actually try to deport all undocumented immigrants in America. What <em>is</em> practical operationally are targeted raids in big cities. And the deleterious economic effects will be largely contained to those cities. It&#39;s a big “fuck you” to blue states.</p><p> I&#39;ve altered my media diet significantly after the election, deliberately choosing to skim, rather than consume, news regarding political affairs outside my interests in the tech industry in general and, of course, Apple in particular. I wrote a few weeks ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag">in my column on Zuckerberg&#39;s content-moderation-policy zig-zag at Meta</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My take on Trump post-election has been to stop paying attention, as best I can, to anything he says. I&#39;m only paying attention to what he <em>does</em> . With any other national leader, there&#39;s a correlation between their words and their eventual actions that makes paying attention to what they say worthwhile. With Trump, there&#39;s almost no correlation, and his endless stream of outrageous proclamations amounts to nothing but a distraction.</p></blockquote><p> <em>This</em> entire post is in contravention of my own guideline quoted above. But I&#39;m making a hopefully rare exception on this undocumented immigration enforcement issue because so much attention, from both sides, is focused on the cruelty and heartbreak. And it does come down to paying attention to what Trump and his administration <em>do</em> , not <em>say</em> . He says they&#39;re targeting all undocumented immigrants, but so far they&#39;re only targeting those who live in places that are popularly opposed to it. And that&#39;s where the costs — both emotional and economic — will be felt.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★冰袭击是我们长期摄入的事实上的寒冷内战的升级</title></entry><entry><link href="https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w10" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/01/fucking_amazon_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41508</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-01-23T00:05:39Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:05:40Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>苹果：</p><blockquote><p> Click the amount you wish to contribute, then click Donate and Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires.</p></blockquote><p> Apple has prominent links to its Red Cross donation form on the web and in the App Store. They&#39;ve been doing this after catastrophes and disasters <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/27/nepal-red-cross-itunes">around the world</a> for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/13/red-cross">a long time</a> . On the surface, it&#39;s great because it&#39;s so easy. Apple already has your saved credentials so it takes just a few taps or clicks to donate. You can measure the time to donate in seconds, not minutes.</p><p> But an under-appreciated aspect of Apple acting as a front-end to the Red Cross is that your donation remains completely private. There&#39;s quite a lot of small print on the donation screen, which starts:</p><blockquote><p> Because Apple is not sharing your personal information with the American Red Cross, the American Red Cross is unable to further acknowledge your donation. You will receive an email receipt from Apple, which will serve as the only record of your donation. The donation will also appear on your credit card statement as a transaction with Apple. You do not purchase any goods or receive any services from Apple by making a donation. Any donation collected by Apple is collected in the name, and on behalf, of the American Red Cross. This donation may not qualify for any tax deduction or other tax benefits. By donating through Apple, you acknowledge that any tax consequences to you in making the donation (including, but not limited to, ensuring you have sufficient documentation to claim any applicable tax deduction) shall be your responsibility. Apple Account credit cannot be used to make a donation. Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires (including Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Kern, Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial Counties).</p></blockquote><p> This sounds like a bunch of ignorable legalese but what it really means is quite interesting. You&#39;re not giving to the Red Cross through this. You&#39;re giving money to Apple, and Apple will then transfer 100 percent of it to the Red Cross. I&#39;m almost certain, for example, that Apple is covering the cost of the card transaction fees.</p><p> By donating this way, you will never get junk mail, email, or text messages from the Red Cross, or from any “partner” of the Red Cross, soliciting additional donations, because the Red Cross will never get your name, address, or数字。 All they get is your money.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/28/messages-political-spam">Back in August I wrote about</a> how my political solicitations via SMS had gotten so out of control, so downright annoying, that my wife and I had scaled back our donations to political campaigns, because it was obvious that previous campaigns we had donated to had shared or sold our information. We&#39;d been put on a Suckers List.</p><p> The same thing, sadly, happens with charities. People generally don&#39;t want to admit to selfishness, but I will. When I give money to a charitable cause, I always look for the checkboxes to opt out of being contacted by them in the future. When it happens anyway, I get annoyed, and I become reluctant to give to that charity again. And because it has happened repeatedly, it&#39;s made me at least somewhat more reluctant to give to <em>any</em> charitable cause in the first place. I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling that way.</p><p> When you donate to the Red Cross via Apple, that concern is off the table. Apple won&#39;t emphasize that aspect of this, because they don&#39;t want to throw the Red Cross under the proverbial bus, but I will. An underrated aspect of privacy is the desire simply not to be annoyed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Southern California Wildfire Relief: Consider Donating to the Red Cross Through Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/apple-red-cross-socal-fire-relief">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>从顶部泄漏的船回来了</title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.rE4.mJTz.1TTdhPOAPRw-&amp;smid=url-share" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41506</id><published> 2025-01-22T21:41:08Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:53:09Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From a multi-byline profile of Stephen Miller in The New York Times last week:</p><blockquote><p> Mr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J. Trump&#39;s terms. He made clear that Mr. Trump would crack down on immigration and go to war against the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, culture that had been embraced by Meta and much of corporate America in recent years.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg was amenable. He signaled to Mr. Miller and his colleagues, including other senior Trump advisers, that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting, who asked for anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would instead focus solely on building tech products.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees&#39; self-expression in the workplace, according to one of the people with knowledge of the meeting. He said new guidelines and a series of layoffs amounted to a reset and that more changes were coming.</p></blockquote><p> This account of the meeting clearly leaked from Trump&#39;s side, not Meta&#39;s side. The tone of it is that Miller told Zuckerberg to jump, and that Zuck obsequiously and gladly responded “How high?”</p><p> Zuckerberg scrambled for cover, posting a “Sheryl did amazing work at Meta and will forever be a legend in the industry [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DE8CZDKSPkw">tweet to Threads</a> , followed by a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lfxlauieic2f">coordinated</a> “Thank you, @zuck. I will always be grateful for the many years we spent building a great business together [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/DE8GHndSWq4">reply from Sandberg</a> . (Sandberg, who left Meta in 2022, only posted <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/C6OdV4Zr6pf">once</a> to Threads in all of 2024. There&#39;s a good chance this will be her only post in 2025.)</p><p> Zuckerberg, politically, seems in way over his head. The first Trump administration was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-trump-aide-says-witnessed-kellyanne-conway-leaking-information-media-220749233.html">infamous for its leaks</a> . They barely hid it. The whole Trump brand is about brazenness. For decades, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/13/trump-john-miller">Trump was known to call reporters in New York under the guise of “John Miller” or “John Barron”</a> , who were ostensibly public relations spokesmen representing Trump. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_used_by_Donald_Trump">it was just him</a> — and he didn&#39;t even disguise his voice. He just did it.</p><p> So of course Stephen Miller (or Miller&#39;s equivalent of John Barron) leaked the confidential nature of his discussion with Zuckerberg to The New York Times, because it made Miller look dominating and Zuckerberg look dominated. Even though it&#39;s painfully obvious to anyone who sees this story that anything confidential they tell Stephen Miller might get leaked if it makes Miller look good. It&#39;s like a perversion of your Miranda rights, a Miranda <em>wrongs</em> if you will: Anything you say to anyone in the Trump administration can and will be used against you in leaks to the media.</p><p> You don&#39;t see stories like this about Cook or Nadella or Bezos, because I think those guys have the good sense to keep their mouths shut and just nod their heads. (Not Musk, though. When Trump and Musk eventually divorce in a spectacular flame-out, we&#39;ll be deluged with stories about what Musk said in supposed confidence.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Ship That Leaks From the Top Is Back’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Legal Nerdery on Trump&#39;s TikTok Executive Order </title><link href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump's-tiktok-executive-order-and-the-limits-of-executive-non-enforcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/legal-nerdery-on-trumps-tiktok-executive-order" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41505</id><published> 2025-01-22T20:37:49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-22T20:37:49Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alan Rozenshtein, writing for Lawfare:</p><blockquote><p> While Apple and Google maintained their compliance, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online">Oracle and Akamai made the remarkable decision to resume services</a> , despite facing potentially catastrophic liability rates.

<p>From Apple&#39;s developer release notes for iOS 18.3, now at release candidate (RC) status:</p><blockquote><p> For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes">Same for MacOS 15.3</a> Sequoia, which is also at RC status and expected next week.</p><p> I have mixed feelings about this decision. It&#39;s pretty obvious that Apple Intelligence has a slew of shortcomings. It&#39;s the nature of the beast, though, that it&#39;s always going to have some shortcomings. <em>Human</em> intelligence, which to date remains the gold standard for intelligence in general, has some pretty glaring shortcomings, so it&#39;s unsurprising that all artificial intelligence systems still do too. (Perhaps that&#39;s a good metric for defining the next inflection point, now that the Turing Test has been passed: When humans need to ask AI systems to explain their own shortcomings, because we&#39;re no longer smart enough to detect them ourselves.)</p><p> So the bar shouldn&#39;t be “has obvious shortcomings”. It&#39;s whether Apple Intelligence is good enough. Compared to other systems, like ChatGPT, no, it&#39;s not good enough. But Apple has been enabling Siri by default since 2011. And Siri, today, is arguably worse than it&#39;s ever been when compared to the state of the art. A friend just sent me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/siri-or-your-own-lii-ing-eyes.jpeg">this screenshot</a> after asking Siri “Who won Super Bowl 13?” and getting this answer: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. In addition to wrongly casing the Roman numerals, LII is 52, not 13. The only way Siri could have been more wrong would be if the Eagles hadn&#39;t even won Super Bowl 52. I just tried the same question — “Who won Super Bowl 13?” — on both my iPhone running iOS 18.3 RC1 and my Mac running MacOS 15.1.1, and Siri gave me the same wrong answer, on both devices, both when the question was spoken aloud and when it was typed: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. Siri, today, is an unfunny joke.</p><p> But so I think it&#39;s reasonable to ask whether Apple Intelligence is as good as Siri. I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s about how good Apple Intelligence is. In fact, I&#39;d say several of the Apple Intelligence features — Clean Up in Photos, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">notification summaries</a> — are <em>better</em> than Siri. So if Siri has been on by default for over a decade, sure, Apple should go ahead and turn Apple Intelligence on by default too.</p><p> I think there could be significant benefit to turning it on by default, sort of in the spirit of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">dogfooding</a> . Enabling Apple Intelligence features by default will increase the pressure on Apple to keep improving it at a fast clip. It&#39;s also the case that none of Apple Intelligence&#39;s features, with the possible exception of notification summaries, are in the user&#39;s face at all. You have to invoke them to use them. If you don&#39;t want them — or don&#39;t even know about them — you won&#39;t notice anything different once they&#39;re enabled by default. Apple may or may not be <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171226-00/?p=97655">over-indexing</a> on Apple Intelligence, but, thankfully, they&#39;re <em>not</em> shoving it in users&#39; faces.</p><p> But, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">as I wrote two weeks ago</a> , enabling it by default for all users really puts the lie to their claim that all of Apple Intelligence is “beta”. If it&#39;s not just merely shipping to all users, but now enabled by default, that&#39;s not beta. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/beta-is-not-an-excuse-archive">That&#39;s just buggy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Next Week’s iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Updates Will Enable Apple Intelligence During Onboarding’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-macos-153-apple-intelligence-default-onboarding">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Support: &#39;About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Apple Support document, which is linked from the App Store if you search for any of the apps from ByteDance:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025. [...]</p><p> If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will remain on your device. But they can&#39;t be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.</p><p> Users in the United States won&#39;t receive updates for these apps, which could potentially impact performance, security, and compatibility with future versions of iOS and iPadOS, and some app functions might become limited or stop working since the app can&#39;t receive updates 。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">My take from Sunday</a> on Trump&#39;s reprieve-by-executive-fiat seems correct: it has no bearing on the law. Really, all his executive order does is instruct the Justice Department (or as he would call it, <em>his</em> Justice Department) not to enforce the law for 75 days, and to promise any company that violates the PAFACA law that they won&#39;t be prosecuted为此。 There&#39;s really no question about it: Oracle and Akamai are violating the law by providing services to TikTok users in the United States. They&#39;re simply taking Trump at his word that the law will not be enforced and they will not face penalties for violating it during Trump&#39;s completely arbitrary 75-day grace period.</p><p> That&#39;s not like a pardon. Trump&#39;s executive order yesterday carries no more legal weight than a Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” card. I don&#39;t think it will happen but there&#39;s nothing that would stop the Trump Justice Department from changing its mind and prosecuting Oracle and Akamai for these violations. It&#39;s up to Trump. There&#39;s also nothing that would stop a future Justice Department under a post-Trump administration from holding them accountable for this.</p><p> Apple and Google are both sticking with the actual law.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Support: ‘About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Wesley Hilliard, writing for AppleInsider regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">Edits</a> , Meta&#39;s pre-announced mobile-first video editing app:</p><blockquote><p> Despite that, many apps and features on iPhone toe the line between fun tool and social platform. One of those tools was Clips, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/06/apple-launches-new-social-focused-clips-video-editing-app-for-iphone-ipad">arrived in 2017</a> to little fanfare and has been forgotten since.</p><p> Meta and ByteDance have a reason to push their respective video editing apps — brand synergy. More users mean more data, more content, and more ad revenue. Apple, however, doesn&#39;t have the same motivation.</p><p> While Apple would likely love to see users flock to Clips, it would mean entering a race to satisfy a wave of several million customers in an app and interface that was never really more than a proof of concept. It would be a money pit with very little reward as Apple doesn&#39;t have a social platform to drive users to or a way to monetize the app.</p></blockquote><p> I completely agree with Hilliard that the announcement of Edits is the perfect time to mention Clips. I completely disagree with him that Apple has no motivation to dedicate itself to the task of making Clips incredible.</p><p> A mobile-first video editor isn&#39;t a “money pit”. It&#39;s an app. Apple makes a lot of apps, and they could easily afford to assign a team to make Clips truly great. It&#39;s no different than 20–25 years ago, when Apple dedicated itself to making iMovie and Final Cut both great apps. It&#39;s no different than the motivation to create GarageBand. The monetization wouldn&#39;t be direct; it would be downstream of the general idea that if you&#39;re editing videos for social media on your phone, the best app to do it with is from Apple and it&#39;s exclusively available on iPhone. The idea is that Apple doesn&#39;t just make the best computing devices for artists, writers, and creators, but they also make some of the best apps for those fields too.</p><p> There are actually a lot of interesting UI ideas in Clips. But if Apple isn&#39;t interested in making Clips truly great for people who actually love editing videos using their phones, they should just abandon it. Make it great or give up. Keeping it around as an also-ran that no one uses is a bad look. This is the sort of thing Apple should pride itself on: best-of-breed creative tools.</p><p> I don&#39;t know if Edits is a rip-off of CapCut or not, but it&#39;s definitely not a rip-off of Clips. It&#39;s a good rule of thumb that when Apple succeeds at something, it gets ripped off. The better the Apple product, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/22/byford-china-android-forks">the more shamelessly it gets copied</a> . Apple should make Clips into an iOS video editing app that everyone rips off shamelessly.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Remember Clips?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Teases &#39;Edits&#39;, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347358/instagram-edits-capcut-video-app-tiktok-ban" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41499</id><published> 2025-01-21T00:34:09Z</published><updated> 2025-01-21T00:34:10Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wes Davis, writing at The Verge, under the headline “Instagram Announces a Blatant CapCut Clone”:</p><blockquote><p> Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBIzLAynIQ/">just announced</a> a video editing app called Edits. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFBNqdGSee4?xmt=AQGzCOMan-oc70fxP0uSA3x3sZd58_GJeUpjK1AD4X30tA">Mosseri said</a> the app is meant to rival CapCut, a video editing app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">went offline along with TikTok</a> . Edits is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378">preorder on the iOS App Store</a> .</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t use CapCut (and can&#39;t download it now), so I can&#39;t judge whether the screenshots of Edits indicate that it&#39;s a copycat of CapCut (say that five times fast), which would be pretty funny coming so closely on the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/">Zuckerberg&#39;s claim on Joe Rogan&#39;s show</a> that Apple hasn&#39;t invented anything new since the iPhone, or if it&#39;s just a different take on a video editing app for phones.

<p>Interesting selection of Martin Luther King Jr. quotes they&#39;ve chosen for the homepage ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/apple.com-mlk-2025.pdf">PDF archive for posterity</a> ):</p><blockquote><ul><li> “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.”</li><li> “You must decide to speak for yourself; nobody else can speak for you.”</li><li> “We cannot preserve self without being concerned about preserving other selves.”</li></ul></blockquote><p> Read into those quotes what you will, given today&#39;s other national significance. I think there&#39;s an implied message here, but it&#39;s subtle.

<p>Tim Cook on X:</p><blockquote><p> Dr. King once said, “Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.”真正的伟大在于举起他人，有所作为并有目的地服务。让我们通过寻找服务和共同创造一个更好的世界的方法来尊重他的遗产。</p></blockquote><p> Curious to see if that&#39;s Cook&#39;s only tweet of the day, or if a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">congratulatory one</a> is forthcoming, after Trump&#39;s oath of office at noon. <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1881426564749156537">Here&#39;s the congratulatory tweet</a> , posted at 2:40pm. No exclamation marks this time.</p><p> Apple has been dedicating its homepage to MLK on his holiday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/search/?s=martin+luther+king+jr">for at least 10 years</a> , so <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk">today</a> isn&#39;t some exception just because it&#39;s also Inauguration Day. But it&#39;s perhaps worth pointing out that few among Apple&#39;s corporate peers are doing this. The homepages of (in market cap order), Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla make no mention of either MLK <em>or</em> Trump&#39;s inauguration. Just another day on the calendar for all of them. But I&#39;m not sure any of those companies ever tend to celebrate holidays on their company homepages.</p><p> But the one company that is famous for its holiday “doodles” is Google. And <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025.pdf">Google&#39;s homepage today</a> makes no mention today of MLK, but does direct visitors&#39; attention to their hosted livestream of Trump&#39;s inauguration. Not a doodle, just “🇺🇸 Live! Watch President Trump&#39;s Inauguration”, and nothing about MLK. [ <strong>Update, 2:15 pm:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025-2.pdf">Google.com now has a nice MLK doodle</a> . Perhaps it was a pre- and post-inauguration distinction? Others report seeing the MLK hopscotch doodle all day.]</p><p> If you want to argue that all of these companies, and each of their CEOs, suck, today&#39;s your day.

<p>Tom Warren, The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Earlier this month you could search for “Google” on Bing and get a page that looked a lot like Google, complete with a special search bar, an image resembling a Google Doodle, and even some small text under the search bar just like Google search 。</p><p> The misleading UI no longer appears on the Google search result of Bing this week, just days after it was originally discovered by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1htjrkn/searching_google_on_bing_gives_you_fake_google">posters on Reddit</a> .</p></blockquote><p> So much for my praise <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/08/bing-google-masquerade">for Microsoft still having it in them</a> to rat-fuck without shame.

<p>Tim Hardwick, last week for MacRumors, “Apple Smart Home Hub Launch Possibly Delayed Until Later in Year”:</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s long-rumoured smart home hub or “command center” may not arrive in the spring as previously expected, according to Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman. [...]</p><p> Apple originally planned to introduce the home hub in March 2025. However, writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5">Power On newsletter</a> , Gurman says that the device “may take longer to reach consumers,” owing to the operating system&#39;s heavy reliance on App Intents features that won&#39;t be ready until iOS 18.4 and iOS 19. This in itself means “it&#39;s plausible that the hardware itself will ship later,” adds Gurman.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5">Here&#39;s Gurman in his own words</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Then there&#39;s the brand-new smart home hub. This device has a roughly 7-inch screen and can help manage household tasks, run apps and conduct video calls. Consumers will be able to hang it on a wall or place it on a countertop — perhaps in a few spots around the home.</p><p> Apple has been planning to introduce the home hub in March, but it may take longer to reach consumers. The device&#39;s new operating system — code-named Pebble — is heavily tied to App Intents features coming in iOS 18.4 and iOS 19, so it&#39;s plausible that the hardware itself will ship a bit later.</p></blockquote><p> How many Apple products that miss “expected” ship dates that were announced only by Gurman do we need before MacRumors writers, and the others on the Gurman <s>regurgitation</s> re-blogging beat, start to wonder whether it&#39;s really the case, as Gurman&#39;s reporting <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/if_a_tree_that_was_never_announced_falls_in_a_forest_does_it_make_a_sound">would have us believe</a> , that every single product from Apple winds up shipping months or even years later than intended?</p><p> Maybe Gurman&#39;s right, and Apple hasn&#39;t shipped a single product on schedule since like maybe <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/01/08/iphone-7-wireless-headphones-beats/">the original AirPods back in 2016</a> (an absolute banger of a scoop, from before Gurman left 9to5Mac for Bloomberg).</p><p> Or, and I&#39;m just tossing this out there, maybe the way companies that are good at shipping new products actually ship new products is by setting aggressive, probably impossible, internal milestones to keep the entire team inside the company and manufacturing partners in the supply chain moving with urgency until the thing is actually ready to announce and ship. And that by reporting these milestones as actual expected ship dates, repeatedly, it makes Mark Gurman and Bloomberg News wrong, not the products late, when those dates are missed without the products ever having been announced. Something like that could happen <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg">when the incentive structure of a news publication is based on whether the reporting moves stock prices</a> , not whether it turns out to be accurate.</p><p> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just the case, though, that Apple has been unable to ship anything new on schedule for close to a decade.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Another Never-Announced Product Might Fail to Meet Its Never-Announced Ship Date’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/another-never-announced-product-might-fail-to-meet-its-never-announced-ship-date">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Joanna Stern&#39;s Imaginary Husband </title><link href="https://techthings.cmail20.com/t/d-e-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-r/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/joanna-sterns-imaginary-husband" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41491</id><published> 2025-01-18T19:36:17Z</published><updated> 2025-01-18T19:36:18Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

The spokesperson noted that, without JavaScript, many Google Search features won&#39;t work properly and that the quality of search results tends to be degraded.</p><p> The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that, on average, “fewer than .1%” of searches on Google are done by people who disable JavaScript. That&#39;s no small number at Google scale. Google processes around 8.5 billion searches per day, so one can assume that millions of people performing searches through Google aren&#39;t using JavaScript.</p><p> One of Google&#39;s motivations here may be inhibiting third-party tools that give insights into Google Search trends and traffic. <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-blocking-seo-rank-checking-tools-volatility-continues-38759.html">According to a post on Search Engine Roundtable</a> on Friday, a number of “rank-checking” tools — tools that indicate how websites are performing in search engines — began experiencing issues with Google Search around the time Google&#39;s JavaScript requirement came into force.</p></blockquote><p> I long ago stopped being a fan (or regular user) of Google Search, but the SEO industry is worse (to keep the Obi-Wan Kenobi quote references going from my headline, you&#39;ll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than “SEO experts”), so I&#39;m amenable to an argument from Google that this is a justifiable step in their never-ending war with SEO scammers seeking to game search results in their favor.</p><p> But the bottom line is that with this change, Google Search is more of an app than it is a website. A website is a server where you can make requests over the HTTP protocol and get results in HTML format. A server that communicates with clients via executable JavaScript is not a website. Whether it&#39;s a justifiable decision or not, I don&#39;t buy for a second that it&#39;s a <em>necessary</em> decision on Google&#39;s part. Thus I find this decision sad, but given the course Google has been on for the last 15 years or so, I&#39;m also unsurprised. Old original Google was a company <em>of</em> and <em>for</em> the open web. Post 2010-or-so Google is a company that sees the web as a de facto proprietary platform that it owns and controls. Those who experience the web through Google Chrome and Google Search are on that proprietary not-closed-per-se-but-not-really-open web.</p><p> Requiring JavaScript for Google Search is <em>not</em> about the fact that 99.9 percent of humans surfing the web have JavaScript enabled in their browsers. It&#39;s about taking advantage of that fact to tightly control client access to Google Search results. But the nature of the true open web is that the server sticks to the specs for the HTTP protocol and the HTML content format, and clients are free to interpret that as they see fit. Original, novel, clever ways to do things with website output is what made the web so thrilling, fun, useful, and amazing. This JavaScript mandate is Google&#39;s attempt at asserting that it will only serve search results to exactly the client software that it sees fit to serve. That&#39;s Google&#39;s right.但这很可悲。</p><p> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42719865">Here&#39;s a good thread on Hacker News discussing the change</a> , with some interesting commentary on the state of the no-JavaScript web. Also worth pointing out that <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> , the best search engine in the world, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@kagihq/113844641987950222">works fine without JavaScript</a> .</p><p> I&#39;ll end with my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/27/web-without-javascript">longstanding</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/22/navistone-form-data">hot take</a> , which, as the years go on, seems more and more obviously true and no longer a hot take at all: The web would be better off if browsers had never added support for scripting. The web would be <em>much</em> faster; much better for its original purpose of delivering content to consume, not software to interact with; and much more secure and private. More control would remain in the hands of client software — and thus in the hands of users — than server-side.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Search, More Machine Now Than Man, Begins Requiring JavaScript’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/google-search-javascript">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Lumon Takes Grand Central&#39; </title><link href="https://parkerspov.substack.com/p/lumon-takes-grand-central" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/17/lumon-takes-grand-central" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41488</id><published> 2025-01-17T23:06:43Z</published><updated> 2025-01-17T23:22:48Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Parker Ortolani works near Grand Central and wrote a great post about the in-character <em>Severance</em> experience on Wednesday, replete with photos, both early in the day when the diorama was largely empty, and later in the day, when it was swarmed with fans and general onlookers because the actors and director Ben Stiller were there.

<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> Here are the changes included in iOS 18.3 for Apple Intelligence notification summaries:</p><ul><li><p> When you enable notification summaries, iOS 18.3 will make it clearer that the feature — like all Apple Intelligence features — is a beta.</p></li><li><p> You can now disable notification summaries for an app directly from the Lock Screen or Notification Center by swiping, tapping “Options,” then choosing the “Turn Off Summaries” option.</p></li><li><p> On the Lock Screen, notification summaries now use italicized text to better distinguish them from normal notifications.</p></li><li><p> In the Settings app, Apple now warns users that notification summaries “may contain errors.”</p></li></ul><p> Additionally, notification summaries have been temporarily disabled entirely for the News &amp; Entertainment category of apps. Notification summaries will be re-enabled for this category with a future software update as Apple continues to refine the experience.</p></blockquote><p> Using italics for summarized notifications is a really clever design. It feels literary. Italics sounds like a different voice to me, which is exactly what these Apple-generated summaries are. Seems so obvious now that I&#39;m seeing it in use, I&#39;m kicking myself for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">not having suggested it</a> .</p><p> And while I can&#39;t blame Apple for temporarily disabling notification summaries for news apps, after just one full day on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/everything-new-in-ios-18-3-beta-3/">beta 3</a> , I already miss them.

<p>Maddy Myers, writing for Polygon:</p><blockquote><p> But the weirdest part of the reveal video, in my opinion, is the implication that the Joy-Cons can be used as a mouse.</p><p> This was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/504149/switch-2-joy-con-mouse">already rumored</a> , and if I hadn&#39;t seen those rumors, then I might not have understood what I was looking at during the portion of the teaser that depicts the Joy-Cons sliding around on a hard surface like a cute lil&#39; mouse 。 Because of those rumors, though, I&#39;m now convinced that this is a thing and the Switch 2 will include this feature. The video specifically shows the Joy-Con mouse position as perpendicular to the surface its on. The new Joy-Con mechanic is further cemented by the part of the video that shows a Joy-Con on its side with a section that really looks like an optical mouse light. [...]</p><p> But this is Nintendo, and Nintendo consoles almost always have a gimmick. The gimmick isn&#39;t always good. Although there were a couple of games that made excellent use of the Wii&#39;s motion controls, I can think of plenty more that were deeply un-fun. Then again, the Wii U&#39;s gimmick — its tablet — paced the way to the first Nintendo Switch, the super-adaptable console we all know and love. So you really never know.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ll just say that Nintendo&#39;s controller gimmicks are usually good, so if the new joy-cons can be used like mice, I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s in an unexpected way.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con Might Double as a Mouse’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/17/switch-2-joy-cons">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
