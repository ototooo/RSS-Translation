<p>John Ourand 和 Alex Silverman，《体育商业杂志》的报道：</p><blockquote><p>上周，当苹果公司的埃迪·库伊开始在华盛顿特区与美国职业足球大联盟老板和高管交谈时，他回想起一年前他与联盟官员的谈话，当时苹果公司正在签署一份为期 10 年的联盟媒体权协议。</p><p>当时，库伊回忆说，上周三，当几位美国职业足球大联盟老板和联盟高管找到他，询问球队可以做些什么来帮助确保这项开创性的交易取得成功时，库伊给出了同样的回应——签下优秀的球员。</p><p>就在世界上最伟大的足球运动员莱昂内尔·梅西 (Lionel Messi) 首次代表迈阿密国际俱乐部亮相的几天前，库伊在美国职业足球大联盟 (MLS) 董事会上发表讲话，他微笑着对美国职业足球大联盟 (MLS) 老板和官员们说：“孩子，你们做到了。”</p></blockquote><p>梅西周五的处子秀非常戏剧化——<a href="https://twitter.com/InterMiamiCF/status/1682575130269032448">加时赛中的一记制胜任意球</a>。如果你把它放进电影剧本里，人们会翻白眼。</p><blockquote><p>美国职业足球大联盟季票订阅者的数量是一个严格保守的秘密。单场比赛的收视率数据从未公开分享。多位高层俱乐部业务主管表示，[苹果公司，<em>原文如此</em>]要求他们签署保密协议，以便了解与 MLS 季票订户数量有关的任何数据。 [...]</p><p>消息人士称，MLS 季票订阅者已接近 100 万，其中包括购买季票时获得访问权限的季票持有者。 6月初，这些消息来源称美国职业足球大联盟(MLS)季票订户基数为70万，联盟高管认为这显示出良好的增长势头，他们预计一旦梅西开始比赛，这一数字还会进一步膨胀。</p></blockquote><p>传统电视广播和流媒体之间的显着区别之一——不仅是体育赛事，而是所有领域——是传统电视的收视率是公开的。网络吹嘘高收视率。对于流媒体来说，收视率是一个严格保守的秘密。 MLS 季票的订阅者数量是否准确？ 100 万？只有苹果知道。这是一个好数字吗？这很难说，因为 NFL、NBA 和 MLB 也对其同等订阅套餐的数量保密。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Apple 的 MLS 交易似乎进展顺利”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/mls-apple">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>线程现在有一个按时间顺序排列的时间线</title><link href="https://www.threads.net/@threadsapp/post/CvIMnF9AQYC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uye" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/threads-following-timeline" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40118</id><published> 2023-07-25T23:38:16Z</published><updated> 2023-07-25T23:38:17Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jacob Wallace、Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham 和 Jason L. Schwartz 在《JAMA Internal Medicine》上发表的一篇论文《佛罗里达州和俄亥俄州共和党和民主党登记选民在 COVID-19 大流行期间的死亡率过高》中表示：</p><blockquote><p> 2018年1月1日至2021年12月31日期间，俄亥俄州和佛罗里达州的研究样本中有538,159人死亡年龄为25岁或以上。死亡中位年龄为 78 岁（IQR，71-89 岁）。总体而言，共和党选民的超额死亡率比民主党选民的超额死亡率高出 2.8 个百分点，即 15%（95% 预测区间 [PI]，1.6-3.7 个百分点）。 2021年5月1日之后，当所有成年人都能接种疫苗时，共和党和民主党选民之间的超额死亡率差距在调整后的分析中从-0.9个百分点（95％PI，-2.5至0.3个百分点）扩大到7.7个百分点（95％PI，6.0-9.3个百分点）；共和党选民的超额死亡率比民主党选民的超额死亡率高出43%。在疫苗接种率较低的县，共和党和民主党选民之间的超额死亡率差距更大，这一差距主要体现在居住在俄亥俄州的选民中。</p></blockquote><p>这项研究强烈表明，与新冠病毒死亡率相关的唯一因素是疫苗接种。此外，新冠肺炎是一种主要导致老年人死亡的疾病——这项研究中的超额死亡率全部发生在 75 岁及以上的人群中。即使在 65-74 岁的人群中，超额死亡率也有所<em>下降</em>。在疫苗问世之前，倾向共和党和倾向民主党的县之间的所有其他政策差异并未导致死亡率出现差异。</p><p>我不知道如何解释只有俄亥俄州而非佛罗里达州出现超额死亡率这一事实。这项研究本身似乎并没有为这种差异提供假设。也许是天气？俄亥俄州的老年人在室内呆的时间更多，而那里的新冠病毒传播<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">可能性更大</a>？</p><p> （<a href="https://politicalwire.com/2023/07/25/republican-counties-had-higher-covid-death-rates/">通过政治专线</a>。）</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“疫苗问世后，共和党县的新冠死亡率更高”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/republican-counties-covid-death-rates">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyc" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/the_dirty_secret_of_os_updates" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/feeds/sponsors//11.40116</id><author><name>大胆火球商务部</name></author><published>2023-07-25T02:54:31Z</published><updated> 2023-07-25T02:54:31Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Ryan Mac 和 Tiffany Hsu，《纽约时报》报道：</p><blockquote><p>这位去年收购了 Twitter 的科技亿万富翁在其网站上将社交平台重新命名为 X.com，并开始用拉丁字母表第 24 个字母的程式化版本取代鸟标志。据《纽约时报》看到的照片显示，在 Twitter 位于旧金山的总部内，自助餐厅里投射了 X 标志，而会议室也被重新命名为带有 X 的单词，包括“eXposure”、“eXult”和“s3Xy”。</p></blockquote><p>这就是为什么特斯拉的车辆型号为 S、3、X 和 Y，并在<a href="https://www.tesla.com/">公司网站</a>上<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/tesla-S3XY.png" title="截至 2023 年 7 月 24 日的 Tesla.com 主导航栏屏幕截图。前四项：Model S、Model 3、Model X、Model Y。">按此顺序列出</a>。它就像联邦快递标志中的箭头，但适用于 12 岁的男孩。</p><blockquote><p>马斯克早就表示他可能会更名，但他在周日早些时候的一条推文中加快了这一进程，他宣称“很快我们将告别 Twitter 品牌，并逐渐告别所有鸟类。”他曾表示，希望将 Twitter 打造成一款名为 X 的“一切应用程序”，不仅涵盖社交网络，还涵盖银行和购物。</p><p>周一早些时候，马斯克还分享了一张 Twitter 旧金山办公楼上投影的巨型 X 的照片，并配文：“今晚是我们的总部。”</p></blockquote><p>我讨厌<sup>*</sup>说“我早就告诉过你了”，但我<a href="https://skeeet.xyz/?url=https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jup7lhivok25">早在 5 月 1 日</a>就预测到了这一确切的名称变更。正如我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/15/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino">在几周后重申这一预测</a>时所写的：</p><blockquote><p>事实上，他现在主要将其称为“这个平台”，这让我认为他会尽快将其重命名为“X”。不过，在我看来，抛弃 Twitter 品牌名称似乎很疯狂，所以也许“X”对于 Twitter 来说就像“Meta”对于 Facebook 和“Alphabet”对于 Google 一样。但同时：马斯克也做了一些疯狂的事情。扔掉整个 Twitter 品牌不会比他一开始就买下它那么疯狂。</p></blockquote><p> 《泰晤士报》的这篇文章引用了一位品牌专家的话说，显而易见的是，品牌名称的动词非常罕见，而且非常有价值。当人们在 Twitter 上发帖时，他们就是在发推文。他们发的推文就是推文。每个人，甚至是从未使用过 Twitter 的人，都知道<em>tweet 的</em>含义。现在<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683365872323133442" title="埃隆·马斯克回复一条推文，询问现在的推文将被称为什么。">马斯克认为</a>它们会被称为“x”？</p><p>尽管事实上马斯克几个月来显然一直在朝着更名的方向努力——如果不是从他提议购买该公司之前开始的话——这一转变完全是（但可以预见的）草率。马斯克声称是“临时”的新徽标只是<a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1D54F">Unicode 字符“𝕏”</a> （U+1D54F，<span class="caps">数学双连大写 X</span> ）。该公司今天试图更换旧金山总部的标牌，但由于对该公司是否拥有工作许可证感到困惑<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/24/twitter-sign-being-removed-downtown-san-francisco-office-x/" title="《旧金山标准》：“旧金山市中心办公室的 Twitter 标志字体已被移除”">，工作被迫停止</a>，标牌<a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1683585476022898688">仅被部分拆除</a>。 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271">iOS</a>和<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android">Android</a>应用程序都没有更新，甚至该公司的网站上几乎到处都写着“Twitter”。</p><p> <small>* 我所说的<em>“恨”</em>当然是指<em>“爱”</em> ，整个周末我都在令人难以忍受地炫耀我的“Being Right Point™”（正确点™）。</small></p><div> <a  title="永久链接“埃隆·马斯克将 Twitter 重命名为 X”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/24/musk-twitter-x">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>吉格克斯</title><link href="https://www.jigx.com/?utm_source=fireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uy3" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/23/jigx" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40107</id><published> 2023-07-23T19:08:03Z</published><updated> 2023-07-23T19:09:56Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Si Daniels，Microsoft Office 设计字体和版式首席项目经理（我的天哪，微软的人都有很长的头衔吗），上周在 Medium 上发表了一篇<a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230713/p36#a230713p36">备受关注的</a>文章， <sup id="fnr1-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn1-2023-07-21">1</a></sup> “ <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/a-change-of-typeface-microsofts-new-default-font-has-arrived-f200eb16718d">字体的变化：微软的新默认字体已经到来</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>亲爱的地球上每一个曾经输入过文字的人，</p></blockquote><p>我知道这只是一个轻松的问候，但让“每个人”看到 Office 默认字体的并不是文本的<em>输入</em>，而是文本的<em>阅读</em>。除了 Excel 之外，我从未经常使用过任何 Office 应用程序，那是 20 多年前的事了。但无论您个人是否使用 Office，都不可能不遇到使用 Office 创建的文档。因此，微软的排版选择影响着我们所有人。 （例如，我从未在 Arial 中设置过任何内容，但由于它的普遍存在，它<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/arial">几乎每天都会令人烦恼</a>。）</p><blockquote><p> 15 年来，我们心爱的 Calibri 一直是 Microsoft 的默认字体和办公通信的皇冠守护者，但如您所知，我们的关系已经<a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">自然结束</a>。我们改变了。我们每天使用的技术已经发生了变化。因此，我们开始寻找适合更高分辨率屏幕的完美字体。字体需要具有清晰度、均匀性，并且适合显示类型。有时令人兴奋，但也令人生畏。如何替换 Calibri？您如何找到一种真正的字体可以取代它作为正确的默认字体？</p><p>正如我们之前<a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">分享的</a>，微软委托使用了五种新字体：Bierstadt、Grandview、Seaford、Skeena 和 Tenorite。我们希望其中一种能够成为 Microsoft 365 的下一个默认字体。所有这些字体都已添加到下拉字体选择器中。从那时起，当您有机会使用它们时，我们听取了您热情的<a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421384582733827">反馈</a>，并选择了最能引起共鸣的一个，那就是比尔施塔特。但随着警卫的变化，名字也发生了变化。比尔施塔特现在被称为阿普托斯。</p></blockquote><p>我不知道微软是否真的根据客户反馈选择了 Aptos（née Bierstadt），但无论如何，它都说明了该公司的很多情况。 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ" title="史蒂夫·乔布斯：“微软没有品味。”">有品味的公司</a>不会通过调查来进行设计。 （我的猜测是，他们一派胡言，可能从一开始就知道他们会选择阿普托斯/比尔施塔特， <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/microsofts-new-default-font-options-rated/" title="TechCrunch 的 Devin Coldewey：“微软新的默认字体选项，已评级”">这是显而易见的选择</a>。“调查”，这样的，似乎<a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421384582733827">只是阅读人们在 Twitter 上的回复</a>。）</p><p>我觉得整个事情很奇怪的是微软仍然没有真正展示任何这些新字体。他们已经提供了它们的一瞥，但主要是大显示尺寸，而不是文本尺寸，而这正是它们在 Office 文档上下文中真正重要的地方。我不是唯一一个<a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/aptos-default-office-font/">对此感到好奇的</a>人。</p><p> So I took matters into my own hands, and created rudimentary specimens for each of Microsoft&#39;s five new typefaces (and Calibri to boot). A–Z in upper- and lowercase, 0–9, and the most common punctuation marks. Then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/30/hoeflers-proof">a paragraph of sample text</a> at 11 points. Dear reader, you really owe me for this one, because I had to use the web app version of Word, by way of Microsoft 365 <sup id="fnr2-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn2-2023-07-21">2</a></sup> to produce these PDFs. To describe this software as brutal and frustrating is an understatement. Herewith, the PDF specimens, and my brief comments:</p><ul><li><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Aptos%20(Bierstadt)%20Specimen.pdf">Aptos</a> — Designed by <a href="https://mattesontypographics.com/">Steve Matteson</a> . I don&#39;t know why Microsoft states as fact that Calibri somehow <em>needed</em> to be replaced as their default font just because it&#39;s 15 years old. A good default font should stand the test of time for decades, if not a literal lifetime. <sup id="fnr3-2023-07-21"><a href="#fn3-2023-07-21">3</a></sup> But if Microsoft feels the need to chase fleeting fashion rather than timeless style, Aptos is the trendiest of the bunch: grotesque sans serifs are having a moment. Aptos is by no means a rip-off of <a href="https://medium.com/@amachino/the-secret-of-san-francisco-fonts-4b5295d9a745">Apple&#39;s San Francisco</a> , but it is, by far, the most San-Francisco-esque of any of these typefaces. Noteworthy characters: J (stunted and ugly), Q (small tail), R (inspired by <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/1160/univers">Univers</a> ?), g (double-story, reminiscent of <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/1763/itc-franklin-gothic">Franklin Gothic</a> &#39;s), and the numeral 1 (curved hat, <em>a la</em> , of all fonts, Arial). But the most distinctive character is the lowercase L, which has a curve to differentiate it from the uppercase i and numeral 1.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Grandview%20Specimen.pdf">Grandview</a> — Designer <a href="https://www.sajatypeworks.com">Aaron Bell</a> <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">admits</a> Grandview was largely inspired by DIN, and it certainly looks like it. Far too mechanical to serve as the default font.

<p>Zoe Kleinman, reporting for BBC News:</p><blockquote><p> Apple says it will remove services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than weaken security if new proposals are made law and acted upon.</p><p> The government is seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016. It wants messaging services to clear security features with the Home Office before releasing them to customers. The act lets the Home Office demand security features are disabled, without telling the public. Under the update, this would have to be immediate. [...]</p><p> WhatsApp and Signal are among the platforms to have opposed a clause in the Online Safety Bill allowing the communications regulator to require companies to install technology to scan for child-abuse material in encrypted messaging apps and other services. They will not comply with it, they say, with Signal threatening to “walk” from the UK.</p></blockquote><p> The BBC headline here is fair: “Apple Slams UK Surveillance-Bill Proposals”. Techmeme&#39;s rewrite of the headline is not: “Apple Threatens to Remove Services Like FaceTime and iMessage From the UK Rather Than Weaken Their Security Under a Proposed Investigatory Powers Act Amendment”. Usually this works the other way around — Techmeme typically rewrites headlines to add clarity and omit clickbait-yness. But Apple (and Signal, and WhatsApp) aren&#39;t making threats here. They&#39;re patiently explaining that E2EE messaging platforms <em>cannot</em> comply with what the UK wants to demand. It&#39;d be like trying to comply with a law that declares 1 + 1 = 3.</p><p> The UK legislators pushing this believe, wrongly, that it must be possible for these messaging platforms to add “good guys only” back doors. That if they pass this law, the result will be that the nerds who work at these companies will be forced to figure out a way to comply. What will actually happen is that these companies will be forced to pull the services from UK, because they can&#39;t comply, unless they scrap their current end-to-end encryption and replace it — worldwide — with something insecure, which they aren&#39;t going to do.</p><p> The UK, of course, is no longer part of the EU, but the unintended consequences are similar: <em>the intention</em> of the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act (well, one intention among many) is to force big social networks to collect data in ways that are more respectful of users&#39; privacy. The actual result is that Threads launched everywhere else in the world <em>but</em> the EU. The <em>intention</em> of the UK&#39;s proposed update to the IPA is to force messaging platforms to make profound technical changes that would allow law enforcement to snoop on messages; the actual result, if it goes into effect, will be to force those messaging platforms out of the UK.</p><p> And while it&#39;s Apple and iMessage/FaceTime that are getting the headlines today, <a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-user-base-uk/">it&#39;s WhatsApp that&#39;s the big player in the UK</a> , with 75 percent of adult Britons using it monthly. It&#39;s hard to overstate how much outrage these legislators are poised to bring upon themselves if they effectively ban WhatsApp. (The legislators themselves surely all depend upon it.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Tries to Explain to U.K. Legislators That You Can’t Add Back Doors to Secure Protocols’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/apple-uk-e2ee">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Facebook Releases Llama 2 Under an &#39;Open for Everyone Other Than Really Large Rivals&#39; License </title><link href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxx" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/facebook-open-llama-2" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40101</id><published> 2023-07-20T23:53:46Z</published><updated> 2023-07-20T23:59:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Facebook:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re now ready to open source the next version of Llama 2 and are making it <a href="http://ai.meta.com/llama">available free of charge for research and commercial use</a> . We&#39;re including model weights and starting code for the pretrained model and conversational fine-tuned versions too. As Satya Nadella announced on stage at Microsoft Inspire, we&#39;re taking our partnership to the next level with Microsoft as our preferred partner for Llama 2 and expanding our efforts in generative AI. Starting today, Llama 2 is available in the Azure AI model catalog, enabling developers using Microsoft Azure to build with it and leverage their cloud-native tools for content filtering and safety features. It is also optimized to run locally on Windows, giving developers a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to customers across different platforms. Llama 2 is available through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Hugging Face, and other providers too.</p></blockquote><p> First, this is yet <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg">another</a> sign that OpenAI <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">has no moat around LLM AI technology</a> . Second, I&#39;m glad to see Facebook drop their awkward “LLaMA” letter-casing style. Third, there&#39;s a notable restriction <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/license/">in Llama 2&#39;s license</a> :</p><blockquote><p> 2. Additional Commercial Terms. If, on the Llama 2 version release date, the monthly active users of the products or services made available by or for Licensee, or Licensee&#39;s affiliates, is greater than 700 million monthly active users in the preceding calendar month, you must request a license from Meta, which Meta may grant to you in its sole discretion, and you are not authorized to exercise any of the rights under this Agreement unless or until Meta otherwise expressly grants you such rights.</p></blockquote><p> 700 million seems oddly specific. Obviously the other companies in the Big Five exceed that number (Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft), but who else? Ben Thompson, in today&#39;s subscriber-only Stratechery update (and — spoiler — tomorrow&#39;s episode of Dithering) notes:</p><blockquote><p> Probably the closest company to that 700 million monthly active user (MAU) figure is Snap, which said <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/snap-says-it-has-passed-750-monthly-active-users-5ca90792">it passed 750 million MAUs earlier this year</a> . Obviously all of the other big consumer tech companies have more than 700 million MAUs, as well as other services like Telegram, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/telegram-raises-210-million-through-bond-sales/">just surpassed 800 million MAUs</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Good news for Elon Musk, though: <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitter-statistics/">Twitter is free to use it</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Facebook Releases Llama 2 Under an ‘Open for Everyone Other Than Really Large Rivals’ License’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/facebook-open-llama-2">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Decline of Windows: Command vs. Control Edition </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/18/command-z" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxw" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/command-vs-control" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40100</id><published> 2023-07-20T23:22:30Z</published><updated> 2023-07-20T23:22:30Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Wayne Ma, reporting for The Information (paywalled):</p><blockquote><p> The iPhone 15 Pro, internally codenamed D83, and Pro Max, codenamed D84, are now in a manufacturing stage known as risk ramp in which Foxconn Technology, which does final assembly of the phones, makes hundreds of thousands of units of the device to test how reliably they can build the product without defects. Apple traditionally moves to mass production, where it begins making millions of iPhone units, in August. The phones typically start to ship to customers in late September.</p><p> One person with direct knowledge said the LG-made displays have failed reliability tests after it goes through a new process known as low injection pressure overmolding or LIPO. The process involves Apple fusing the display into its metal shell prior to assembly. Apple is repeatedly tweaking the design of LG&#39;s display so that it can pass the tests.</p><p> However, Apple still can use displays made by its leading supplier Samsung, ensuring that it can continue to assemble a significant amount of units.</p></blockquote><p> What going legit was to Michael Corleone, breaking free of dependence upon Samsung is to Tim Cook: “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UneS2Uwc6xw">Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in</a> .”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Wayne Ma: Display Manufacturing Problems Might Lead to Shortages of iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/ma-iphone-15-pro-delay">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kevin Mitnick Dies From Pancreatic Cancer at 59 </title><link href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/las-vegas-nv/kevin-mitnick-11371668" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxu" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40098</id><published> 2023-07-20T20:57:46Z</published><updated> 2023-07-20T22:57:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tragic news from King David Memorial Chapel and Cemetery in Las Vegas:</p><blockquote><p> Kevin David Mitnick, 59, died peacefully on Sunday, July 16, 2023, after valiantly battling pancreatic cancer for more than a year. Kevin is survived by his beloved wife, Kimberley Mitnick, who remained by his side throughout their 14-month ordeal. Kimberley is pregnant with their first child. Kevin was ecstatic about this new chapter in his and Kimberley&#39;s life together, which has now been sadly cut short.</p></blockquote><p> All cancers can go fuck themselves, but man, pancreatic cancer has taken so many people of late: Alex Trebek, Pixar animator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston">Ralph Eggleston</a> , Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and of course Steve Jobs. Also: Jef Raskin and Randy Pausch (“ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">The Last Lecture</a> ” professor).</p><p> Just brutal to hear that Mitnick&#39;s wife is pregnant.</p><blockquote><p> Kevin emerged from his final prison term, which he deemed a “vacation”, in January 2000. He was a changed individual, and began constructing a new career, as a White Hat hacker and security consultant. He became a highly sought-after global public speaker, a writer, and established the successful Mitnick Security Consulting. In November 2011, he became the Chief Hacking Officer and part owner of security awareness training company KnowBe4, founded by close friend and business partner Stu Sjouwerman.</p><p> Kevin attracted attention and support from unlikely sources. The bus driver who saw young Kevin memorize the bus schedules, punch cards and punch tool systems so he could ride the buses all day for free testified as a character witness for Kevin during his federal trial. The federal prosecutor offered his testimony that Kevin never tried to take one dime from any of his “victims”. The probation officer assigned to monitor Kevin after prison gave Kevin permission to write his first book on a laptop when he was not yet supposed to have access to computers. Shawn Nunley, the star witness in the FBI&#39;s case against Kevin, became so disillusioned with the government&#39;s treatment of Kevin that he contacted Kevin&#39;s defense team, helped garner Kevin&#39;s release, and became one of Kevin&#39;s dearest friends. Kevin had an irresistible way of converting foes to friends and keeping them as friends forever.</p></blockquote><p> Mitnick was technically gifted, but his greatest hacking skill was social engineering.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kevin Mitnick Dies From Pancreatic Cancer at 59’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxt" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40097</id><published> 2023-07-20T01:23:41Z</published><updated> 2023-07-20T05:28:37Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Once you view Bloomberg&#39;s original reporting through this prism — that most of their original reporting is delivered with the goal of moving the stock prices of the companies they&#39;re reporting on, for the purpose of proving the value of a Bloomberg Terminal&#39;s hefty subscription fee to day-trading gamblers — a lot of their seemingly inexplicable stylistic quirks don&#39;t seem so inexplicable any more. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg, “ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google">Apple Tests &#39;Apple GPT,&#39; Develops Generative AI Tools to Catch OpenAI</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> The iPhone maker has built its own framework to create large language models — the AI-based systems at the heart of new offerings like ChatGPT and Google&#39;s Bard — according to people with knowledge of the efforts. With that foundation, known as “Ajax”, Apple also has created a chatbot service that some engineers call “Apple GPT”.</p><p> In recent months, the AI push has become a major effort for Apple, with several teams collaborating on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The work includes trying to address potential privacy concerns related to the technology.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s not surprising that Apple has a project like this underway. It would be rather shocking if they didn&#39;t. And it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that Apple is a latecomer to shipping software that exposes AI chatbot-type features. Apple is seldom first to adopt new technology, especially something with the privacy ramifications of AI chat.</p><p> I was banging this drum before WWDC, but one app that <em>needs</em> this sort of functionality is Xcode. Xcode is the only major developer IDE I&#39;m aware of that doesn&#39;t offer AI code generation and analysis. I&#39;ve seen some demos from readers who use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft&#39;s VS Code</a> and they&#39;re amazing.</p><p> Next paragraph:</p><blockquote><p> Apple shares gained as much as 2.3% to a record high of $198.23 after Bloomberg reported on the AI effort Wednesday, rebounding from earlier losses. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI&#39;s partner and main backer, slipped about 1% on the news.</p></blockquote><p> If you ever notice, Bloomberg news stories <em>always</em> contain updates like this. It&#39;s an obsession unique to Bloomberg. My understanding is that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-reporters-compensation-2013-12">this decade-old Business Insider story remains true</a> : Bloomberg reporters are evaluated and receive bonuses tied to reporting market-moving news. They&#39;re incentivized financially to make mountains out of molehills, and craters out of divots, to maximize the immediate effect of their reporting on stock prices. And Bloomberg appends these stock price movements right there in their reports, to drive home the notion that Bloomberg publishes market-moving news, so maybe you too should spend over $2,000 per month on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/">a Bloomberg Terminal</a> so that you can receive news reports from Bloomberg minutes before the general public, and buy, sell, and short stocks based on that news. No other news organization I&#39;m aware of has an incentive system like this for reporters — but no other news organization has a business like the Bloomberg Terminal.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bloomberg-aapl-2023-07-19.png">Here&#39;s the graph of Apple&#39;s share price today</a> . Gurman&#39;s report was published at 12:03pm, and boom, Apple&#39;s stock price jumped at exactly 12:04pm. It then mostly came back down to where it was, presumably after everyone realized there really wasn&#39;t any news here other than the fact that Apple is working on something we all presumed they were working on. Apple&#39;s stock finished up 0.7 percent for the day.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bloomberg-msft-2023-07-19.png">Microsoft&#39;s stock graph for today</a> doesn&#39;t show as dramatic a downward spike as Apple&#39;s jump, but they were trading at $359.35 at 12:01, and dropped to $356.84 at exactly 12:04, one minute after Gurman&#39;s report hit Bloomberg Terminals. The “ <em>this is bad news for Microsoft</em> ” line of thinking, presumably, is that if OpenAI has a long-term moat around LLM AI technology, Microsoft is likely to acquire them or otherwise maintain their position as an exclusive partner, and Apple might eventually need to pay through the nose to license OpenAI/Microsoft technology. But <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">if there is no moat</a> , and even Apple is developing its own LLM systems, then maybe Microsoft&#39;s partnership with OpenAI isn&#39;t worth much long-term.</p><p> Apple&#39;s brief 2.7 percent jump and Microsoft&#39;s smaller but still-significant drop, both at 12:04pm, were clearly caused by Gurman&#39;s report. Bloomberg Terminal subscribers get such reports before anyone else. (Bloomberg employees, of course, know such information <em>before</em> it&#39;s published, but I&#39;m sure never do anything untoward with it.) Once you view Bloomberg&#39;s original reporting through this prism — that most of their original reporting is delivered with the goal of moving the stock prices of the companies they&#39;re reporting on, for the purpose of proving the value of a Bloomberg Terminal&#39;s hefty subscription fee <sup id="fnr1-2023-07-19-B"><a href="#fn1-2023-07-19-B">1</a></sup> to day-trading gamblers — a lot of their seemingly inexplicable stylistic quirks don&#39;t seem so inexplicable any more. They just seem a little gross.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-07-19-B"><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal">According to Wikipedia</a> , “the Bloomberg Terminal is available for an annual fee of around $24k per user or $27k per year for subscribers that use only one terminal.

<p>Unity:</p><blockquote><p> Unity, the world&#39;s leading platform for creating and growing real-time 3D (RT3D) content, announced today the launch of its beta program for visionOS that includes access to Unity PolySpatial. Featuring integration with the Unity editor, creators can build experiences that run in visionOS, and leverage the amazing features of Apple Vision Pro. By combining Unity&#39;s new PolySpatial technology with Apple&#39;s RealityKit-managed app rendering, content created in Unity will have a unified look and feel, alongside other apps in visionOS. And Unity has worked closely with Apple to offer support for visionOS and PolySpatial, so users can experience their favorite Unity apps on day one in all new spatial environments made possible by Apple Vision Pro. Developers interested in signing up for the beta can visit <a href="https://create.unity.com/spatial">https://create.unity.com/spatial</a> .</p></blockquote><p> This seems to be a deep partnership between Apple and Unity. There were a couple of sessions at WWDC last month about Unity and VisionOS. It&#39;s impossible to say what would&#39;ve happened if <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/epic+v+apple">Epic hadn&#39;t chosen to go to war</a> against Apple with its Fortnite shenanigans, but given that they did, there&#39;s pretty much zero chance Apple would integrate VisionOS with Epic&#39;s Unreal Engine the way they are with Unity.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Unity Launches Beta Program for VisionOS ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/19/unity-visionos-beta">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/nerding_out_with_maestral_launchcontrol_and_keyboard_maestro" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxr" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40095</id><published> 2023-07-19T19:19:38Z</published><updated> 2023-07-19T21:47:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Two ways to automatically relaunch an app that&#39;s crashing in the background. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><em>Item 1:</em> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/products?source=plans">Dropbox</a> remains an excellent service, seemingly utterly reliable, with fair pricing.</p><p> <em>Item 2:</em> Dropbox&#39;s official Mac client has been a confusing, ugly, resource-heavy mess for years, and is only getting worse.</p><p> <em>Item 3:</em> <a href="https://maestral.app/">Maestral</a> is an open source Dropbox client for MacOS and Linux, developed by Sam Schott. It provides exactly what I want in a Mac Dropbox client, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/06/13/dropbox-sucks">what the official Dropbox app once was</a> , long ago: a folder that syncs, with a minimal user interface that lives in a menu bar app. It <a href="https://maestral.app/about/">uses far less memory</a> than Dropbox&#39;s official client and offers a much simpler interface.</p><p> I switched from Dropbox&#39;s official Mac client to Maestral last August. Overall I&#39;ve been very happy with the move. But Maestral is not for everyone. <a href="https://maestral.app/about/">From Maestral&#39;s website, under “Limitations”</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Currently, Maestral does not support Dropbox Paper, the management of Dropbox teams and the management of shared folder settings. If you need any of this functionality, please use the Dropbox website or the official client.</p><p> Maestral uses the public Dropbox API which, unlike the official client, does not support transferring only those parts of a file which changed (“binary diff”). Maestral may therefore use more bandwidth that the official client. However, it will avoid uploading or downloading a file if it already exists with the same content locally or in the cloud.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t use Dropbox Paper, don&#39;t have a Dropbox “team”, and I&#39;m fine going to the Dropbox website to manage shared folder settings. The only thing I miss from the official Dropbox client is the Finder contextual menu item to copy a sharing link to an item — but I need that seldom enough that I don&#39;t much mind doing that on the Dropbox website too.</p><p> Another big difference: <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/installs/dropbox-for-macos-support">the official Dropbox client is transitioning</a> to MacOS&#39;s relatively new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider">File Provider APIs</a> . These are the APIs that allow cloud-based storage providers to keep certain files online-only, downloading the file locally only when you need it. I don&#39;t need or want that. I just want my entire Dropbox folder&#39;s contents to sync entirely. (Maestral does support Dropbox&#39;s “selective sync” to omit specified folders and files, but those omitted files don&#39;t show up at all in your local folder.) If you keep your Dropbox folder on an external hard drive, you might <em>need</em> to switch to Maestral, because Apple&#39;s File Provider APIs require folders to be stored in <em>~/Library/CloudStorage/</em> . With Maestral, your local Dropbox folder can be anywhere.</p><p> Bottom line: 11 months in, and I&#39;m a very happy Maestral user.</p><p>但。 For the last month or so, I&#39;ve noticed that whenever I wake my Mac (an M1 MacBook Pro running MacOS Ventura 13.4.1), Maestral (version 1.7.3) is no longer running. It crashes silently in the background while my Mac is sleeping (or when waking up?). <a href="https://github.com/samschott/maestral/issues/939">Here&#39;s an issue filed for the bug on GitHub</a> , dittoed by half a dozen users. The obvious band-aid solution is to manually relaunch Maestral each time I wake my Mac, but that&#39;s annoying and easy to forget. The whole point of Dropbox is that it just works in the background, automatically.</p><p> While waiting for a fix in Maestral itself, here are two workarounds. They should be applicable in any situation where you want to automatically relaunch an app that is periodically crashing in the background.</p><h2> Workaround 1: LaunchControl and launchd</h2><p> <a href="https://www.launchd.info/"><code>launchd</code></a> is Apple&#39;s longstanding (dating back to Mac OS X 10.4) system for running background processes, either on a schedule or triggered by events. The built-in way to manage <code>launchd</code> jobs is the <code>launchctl</code> command-line utility. <sup id="fnr1-2023-07-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-07-19">1</a></sup> <code>launchd</code> is very nerdy and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html">has a ton of features</a> .</p><p> Enter Robby Pählig&#39;s <a href="https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/">LaunchControl</a> : “a fully-featured <code>launchd</code> GUI allowing you to create, manage and debug system and user services on your Mac.” It costs $21 for a personal license and is worth every cent. LaunchControl is well-designed, comprehensive, and extensively-documented.</p><p> In my case, I wanted to create a new <code>launchd</code> job that will keep Maestral running at all times. When it crashes while my Mac is sleeping, I just want it to silently relaunch. Creating such a job using LaunchControl is trivial.</p><p> First, drag and drop the Maestral app onto the LaunchControl app icon. This will show a dialog box like this: </p><p><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/launchcontrol-create-agent.png"
    alt="Screenshot of LaunchControl’s Create Agent alert."
    width = 50%
  /></p><p> Click “For current user”. <sup id="fnr2-2023-07-19"><a href="#fn2-2023-07-19">2</a></sup></p><p>就是这样。 This does exactly what we want by default: it creates a new user-only <code>launchd</code> job that keeps Maestral alive no matter what. If it crashes, it&#39;ll be relaunched. If we quit Maestral manually, it&#39;ll be relaunched.</p><p> One bit of manual fiddling I suggest is giving the job a descriptive name. By default, LaunchControl just names it “local.job”. I renamed mine “local.Maestral.keepalive”:</p><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/launchcontrol-renaming-agent.png" class="noborder"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/launchcontrol-renaming-agent.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the “keep alive” launchd job in LaunchControl."
    width = 500
  /></a></p><p> The file for this job (after renaming) lives at <em>~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.Maestral.keepalive.plist</em> . But you never really need to deal with that file if you&#39;re using LaunchControl. If you ever want to trash it (eg after a version of Maestral ships with a fix for this bug), you can do so within LaunchControl itself.</p><h2> Workaround 2: Keyboard Maestro and AppleScript</h2><p> For anyone else out there running into this bug with Maestral 1.7.3, the LaunchControl/ <code>launchd</code> solution described above is all you need for a workaround. But the nerd in me wanted to know <em>how often</em> Maestral was crashing in the background. When Maestral crashes while my Mac is sleeping, it doesn&#39;t seem to leave any sort of log describing what happened or when.</p><p> So here&#39;s another workaround, this time using <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and a tiny AppleScript. First, create a new global macro in Keyboard Maestro. I named mine “Maestral: Keep Alive”. Set it up like this:</p><p> <a href = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/keyboard-maestro-maestro-keepalive.png" class="noborder"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/keyboard-maestro-maestro-keepalive.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the macro in Keyboard Maestro."
    width = 500
  /></a></p><p> The trigger is “Periodically while logged in”, running once a minute, all day, every day of the week. The action is this simple AppleScript:</p><pre> <code>if application &quot;Maestral&quot; is not running then display notification (current date) as string ¬ with title &quot;Maestral was not running&quot; do shell script &quot;/usr/bin/open /Applications/Maestral.app&quot; end if</code></pre><p> If Maestral is running when this script runs, nothing happens. If it isn&#39;t, the script <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/keyboard-maestro-maestro-keepalive-notification.png">displays a notification</a> with the current date and time, and then launches Maestral. Sometimes I notice the notification appear after I wake my Mac, sometimes I don&#39;t. But I can go to Notification Center and see the whole stack of them to see how often it&#39;s occurring. (Turns out it gets triggered a dozen or so times overnight, every day.)</p><p> Astute scripters might wonder why I&#39;m using <code>do shell script &quot;/usr/bin/open /Applications/Maestral.app&quot;</code> to launch Maestral, instead of the idiomatic <code>tell application &quot;Maestral&quot; to launch</code> . Good question. The answer is that each time Keyboard Maestro runs this AppleScript, it needs to be compiled. And whenever an AppleScript is compiled, any applications targeted by <code>tell</code> blocks will be launched if they aren&#39;t already running. That&#39;s just a quirk of how AppleScript works, but in this particular case, it would defeat the entire purpose of the script, because when the script runs, Maestral would always be running, because if it weren&#39;t already running before the macro started executing, it would get launched when Keyboard Maestro compiled the script, which happens right before the script is actually run. So we relaunch Maestral with a one-line shell script instead.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-07-19"><p> The standard POSIX <code>cron</code> utility is still supported on MacOS, but is deprecated in favor of <code>launchd</code> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-07-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-07-19"><p> Which, to be a HIG pedant, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons">ought to be title-cased</a> : “For Current User”. <a href="#fnr2-2023-07-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nerding Out With Maestral, LaunchControl, and Keyboard Maestro</title></entry><entry><title> Steven Soderbergh&#39;s &#39;Command Z&#39; </title><link href="https://commandzseries.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxq" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/18/command-z" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40094</id><published> 2023-07-19T00:47:59Z</published><updated> 2023-07-20T22:50:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><em>Command Z</em> is an eight-episode sci-fi time-travel parody directed by Steven Soderbergh, and distributed on its own website. It costs $8, and all proceeds <a href="https://commandzseries.com/causes">are going to charity</a> . It feels fair to describe it as a Soderbergh-ian take on <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/7512-idiocracy">Idiocracy</a></em> . It debuted yesterday, 17 July 2023, which is cleverly meta insofar as that&#39;s the date the characters in the movie travel back in time to.</p><p> I enjoyed it — it was easily worth $8. It&#39;s lighthearted and well-cast, with some very funny throwaway jokes about the future the characters live in. But because it&#39;s only available through its own website, the only way to watch <em>Command Z</em> on a TV is via AirPlay, and that kind of sucks for something this long. Pause for too long and you can&#39;t just un-pause, you need to open your phone and start the AirPlay connection all over again. And even if you watch straight through without pausing, you need to fiddle with your phone between episodes. For watching on a phone, it&#39;s probably good that it&#39;s broken up into 8 short episodes, but for watching on TV via AirPlay, it&#39;d be much better if you could just watch it straight through like a movie. The eight episodes vary in length from 7–20 minutes, but with a total running time of about 95 minutes, you can think of it as an eight-chapter movie.</p><p> I&#39;d love to see more filmmakers shoot micro-budget indie projects like this, but there ought to be a better way to distribute them for consumption on TVs.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> I noticed, of course, that the series is titled <em>Command Z</em> , not <em>Control Z</em> . They even use the “⌘” glyph in the logotype. But while of course a man of Soderbergh&#39;s refined taste <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803110534/http://www.apple.com:80/hotnews/articles/2002/04/fullfrontal/fullfrontal1.html">is a long-time Mac user</a> , the fact that it&#39;s not <em>Control Z</em> is yet <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/browser_and_os_market_share_trends_in_the_mobile_age">another sign</a> that the Windows hegemony is over.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Steven Soderbergh’s ‘Command Z’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/18/command-z">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://www.jigx.com?utm_source=fireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxp" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/jigx" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40093</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-07-17T20:52:20Z</published><updated> 2023-07-17T20:52:21Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Alex Miller:</p><blockquote><p> An obsession was born. I was intoxicated by graph paper. The emptiness of a totally blank page intimidated me by demanding that I make the first move, but graph paper invited my participation by steering my pencil in the grooves of its strictly regular lines. The grid was like a friend who had already done half the work for me. I drew mazes, maps, patterns, plans — all held by the sturdiness of the grid. The effect was soothing. Through the grid&#39;s lattice, all my drawings, no matter how primitive, took on an air of rational certainty.</p><p> Around the same time that my dad showed me the grid map game, I started using a computer. In our house, down the carpeted stairs, in the basement, there was a light wood desk, upon which sat a beige plastic box with a rainbow striped Apple logo on the front: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7500">Power Macintosh</a> . Through this machine&#39;s chunky, low res monitor, I witnessed a grid come to life. Each pixel was a modular, addressable component in a digital whole. The windows, the buttons, the fonts, the menus, and the icons — oh, the icons! The world of the computer was filled with little hieroglyphic pictures representing folders, files, control panels, and drawing tools, each crisply rendered on the pixel grid of the screen. The logic and aesthetic of the grid permeated the virtual world of the computer — all rational, all peaceful.</p></blockquote><p> This essay hit close to home. As a kid, I too was obsessed both with graph paper and computers, and intuited a deep connection between the two.

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is chock-a-block with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: drafting emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk: malware, data governance, and prompt injection attacks.</p><p> Kolide is taking a two-part approach to governing AI use: allowing you to draft AI policies <em>as a team</em> , and using Kolide to block malicious tools. <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/17/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> 1973 Training Video for Bell Labs&#39;s Holmdel Computing Center</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMYiktO0D64" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/16/bell-labs-training-video" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40088</id><published> 2023-07-16T15:57:31Z</published><updated> 2023-07-16T16:14:28Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Twitter:</p><blockquote><p> To be considered eligible for creator ads revenue sharing you must:</p><ol><li> Be subscribed to Twitter Blue or Verified Organizations</li><li> Have at least 5M impressions on your posts in each of the last 3 months.</li><li> Pass human review for Creator Monetization Standards.</li></ol></blockquote><p> The idea is that this will turn Twitter into a YouTube-like platform for high-profile accounts. Seems like it might be a sham at this point though — there&#39;s no open enrollment, and the people who are getting paid now seem hand-selected by Elon Musk. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/">Taylor Lorenz, writing for The Washington Post</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Former Twitter staffers who worked on creator-focused products expressed skepticism over the rollout, with several calling it a PR stunt. One former Twitter executive who worked on creator partnerships and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, said that “any kind of content monetization we&#39;ve done in the past was based on a revenue model. This just feels pulled out of thin air for a specific subset of creators that he wanted to placate.”</p><p> The former Twitter executive also cast doubt on Twitter&#39;s revamped metrics, including impressions. “The numbers are totally and completely bogus. It&#39;s all completely made up. It really feels like they&#39;re arbitrarily writing checks to people they like, which is not a sustainable creator strategy.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s worth taking quotes from anonymous “former Twitter staffers” with a grain of salt (and, perhaps, taking Lorenz&#39;s byline <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/dont-be-a-doomer">with its own grain of salt</a> ), but it&#39;s worth taking new Twitter initiatives with a truckload of salt. I really doubt this is going to prove sustainable. Would be kind of awesome, though, for someone to eventually be able to declare themselves a professional tweeter.</p><p> But it kind of smells like a scam: First you sign up to pay Twitter $8/month. Then you wait and see if you get selected to participate. Then they <em>might</em> start paying you. It&#39;s like Amway-style multi-level marketing for social media.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Twitter Has Begun Paying a Select Group of ‘Creators’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/15/twitter-paying-creators">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex </title><link href="https://www.abandonedamerica.us/bell-labs" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxh" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/15/bell-labs-holmdel-complex" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40085</id><published> 2023-07-16T03:58:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-16T16:15:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Matthew Christopher at Abandoned America:</p><blockquote><p> The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex in Holmdel, New Jersey was created as a new research and development facility for Bell Telephone when they decided to move operations out of Manhattan. Constructed between 1959 and 1962, it was the swan song of architect Eero Saarinen, who also designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Center. Saarinen died a year before Holmdel was completed and six years before the six story complex would be named Laboratory of the Year by R&amp;D Magazine. The outside curtain wall of mirrored glass that allowed in 25 percent of the sun&#39;s light while blocking 70 percent of its heat led to the Holmdel Complex being christened “The Biggest Mirror Ever” by Architectural Forum, and the complex was used in universities as example of one of the crowning achievements of the modernist architectural style. [...]</p><p> Architect Alexander Gorlin allowed me to photograph Bell Labs shortly before the renovation began. Much of the interior had been stripped to the basic elements and the plants in the atrium were gone, but the architecture was still mesmerizing. I had visited the building when it was open many years ago but it was unfamiliar to me now. Many of the rooms were entirely anonymous after everything in them had been removed.</p></blockquote><p> Fans of <em>Severance</em> will recognize that stunning atrium immediately — this building serves as the set for Lumon Industries&#39;s headquarters.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/15/bell-labs-holmdel-complex">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> It&#39;s Official: Lionel Messi Joins Inter Miami CF </title><link href="https://www.intermiamicf.com/news/inter-miami-cf-signs-seven-time-ballon-d-or-winner-world-cup-champion-lionel-mes" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxj" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/15/messi-miami-official" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40087</id><published> 2023-07-15T23:54:24Z</published><updated> 2023-07-15T23:54:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Craig Mod:</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve long since posited world peace could be achieved if you bought everyone in the world a bike, but now I want those bikes to be electric. I want everyone to feel this silliness, this punch-drunk stupidity of pure love, this sense of cheating the rules, the norms, this sense of ever-present delight. At our worst, humans mindlessly consume, sear the earth and each other, fill our bodies with poisons. At our best we invent electric bikes. Batteries have gotten more efficient, motors smaller and more powerful. The last decade has brought great efficiency to these machines, and the next ten years will only double down on these gains. Electric bike numbers are up, year over year over year. Tremendously so. Those who know, proselytize. We can&#39;t help it. The charm is too great. The game non- zero sum. The more people who know, the better the world. It&#39;s a wild notion, this sense of goodness to be had if you just reach out for it. Goodness with no real downside. Like solar panels or wind turbines, electric bikes are machines that buoy the spirit and the earth.</p></blockquote><p> What a lovely essay.

<p>Dominic Patten, reporting for Deadline two days ago:</p><blockquote><p> “I think we&#39;re in for a long strike, and they&#39;re going to let it bleed out,” said one industry veteran intimate with the POV of studio CEOs. With the scribes&#39; strike now finishing its 71st day and the actors&#39; union just 30 hours from a possible labor action of its own, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are planning to dig in hard this fall before even entertaining the idea of more talks with the WGA, I&#39;ve learned. “Not Halloween precisely, but late October, for sure, is the intention,” says a top-tier producer close to the Carol Lombardini-run AMPTP. [...]</p><p> Receiving positive feedback from Wall Street since the WGA went on strike May 2, Warner Bros Discovery, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Disney, Paramount and others have become determined to “break the WGA,” as one studio exec blatantly put it. To do so, the studios and the AMPTP believe that by October most writers will be running out of money after five months on the picket lines and no work.</p><p> “The endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses,” a studio executive told Deadline. Acknowledging the cold-as-ice approach, several other sources reiterated the statement. One insider called it “a cruel but necessary evil.”</p></blockquote><p> Cold as ice indeed.

<p>The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> About 160,000 television and movie actors are going on strike at midnight, joining screenwriters who walked off the job in May and setting off Hollywood&#39;s first industrywide shutdown in 63 years. The leaders of the union, SAG-AFTRA, approved a strike on Thursday, hours after contract talks with a group of studios broke down. Actors will be on the picket line starting on Friday.</p><p> “What&#39;s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor,” said Fran Drescher, SAG-AFTRA&#39;s president. “When employers make Wall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the essential contributors who make the machine run, we have a problem.” [...]</p><p> It&#39;s been even longer — since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films — since actors and screenwriters were on strike at the same time. The dual strikes pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal, Sony and Paramount, as well newer juggernauts like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.</p></blockquote><p> Labor is clearly on the upswing, and there&#39;s no higher-profile union than the Screen Actors Guild, whose members are <em>literal</em> movie stars.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hollywood Actors to Strike, Setting Off Industrywide Shutdown’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/hollywood-actors-strike">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Anchor Brewing Was San Francisco&#39; </title><link href="https://defector.com/anchor-brewing-was-san-francisco" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxc" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/anchor-brewing-sf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40080</id><published> 2023-07-13T21:18:38Z</published><updated> 2023-07-13T22:17:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Patrick Redford, writing for Defector:</p><blockquote><p> It is tempting to read this as another grim story about the pandemic claiming a beloved business, given an extra bit of apocalyptic flair by the degree to which Anchor is synonymous with San Francisco. In that light, the death of one of the city&#39;s most iconic companies goes hand in hand with the narrative that San Francisco is a dying city riven by the tripartite scourges of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-francisco-crime-problem-runs-deeper-than-rosy-statistics-from-city">unchecked crime</a> , spiraling unaffordability, and, uh, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/silicon-valley-bank-wokeness-17841353.php">wokeness</a> . Even if you don&#39;t want to go that far, you can correlate San Francisco&#39;s high office space vacancy rates, declining <a href="https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/featured/craft-sales-continue-to-struggle-in-2023-nbwa-march-beer-purchasers-index-confirms/">national craft beer sales</a> , and “inflation,” and conclude that this economy was too harsh for Anchor to survive in. Indeed, how can any small business keep its lights on under such conditions? That is the story Sapporo&#39;s PR goons are selling and <a href="https://twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1679038989121077249">the San Francisco Chronicle</a> is buying, without any pushback or worker perspective, even though it&#39;s not true. Economic conditions matter, though they aren&#39;t nearly as relevant to the Anchor story as Sapporo&#39;s uniquely catastrophic stewardship of the company.</p></blockquote><p> A fine remembrance, replete with great links to further reading, including <a href="https://lithub.com/the-model-for-americas-modern-craft-beer-boom-inside-the-small-brewer-scene-in-1950s-san-francisco/">this excerpt</a> from David Burkhart&#39;s book, published just last year, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-anchor-brewing-story-america-s-first-craft-brewery-san-francisco-s-original-anchor-steam-beer-david-burkhart/7277948?ean=9780399581236">The Anchor Brewing Story</a></em> .</p><p> What comes to mind is that small-scale excellence is delicate and precious. It seems unfathomable that Anchor could be losing money when their beer remains as popular as ever, but leave it to a large conglomerate like Sapporo to tank a good small thing in the name of making it a bigger thing.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Anchor Brewing Was San Francisco’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/anchor-brewing-sf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The &#39;X&#39; Stands for Bullshit </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23792553/elon-musk-xai-artificial-intelligence-company" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxb" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/xai" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40079</id><published> 2023-07-13T02:26:10Z</published><updated> 2023-07-13T02:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>As a palate cleanser after the bitter news about Anchor Brewing, here&#39;s something delightful: a behind-the-scenes look at San Francisco&#39;s House of Prime Rib.

<p>Jess Lander and Caleb Pershan, reporting sad news for the San Francisco Chronicle:</p><blockquote><p> San Francisco institution Anchor Brewing Co., the godfather of steam beer, is shutting down after 127 years. The brewery was “losing millions of dollars a year,” said Anchor spokesperson Sam Singer. “Economic pressures have made the business no longer sustainable.”</p><p> Anchor has already brewed its final beer at the historic Potrero Hill brewery — “there&#39;s no steam coming out of the brewery now,” said Singer — and notified the brewery&#39;s 61 employees of the shutdown early Wednesday morning. The brewery&#39;s taproom, Anchor Public Taps, will continue operating until at least Aug. 1, possibly longer.</p><p> The news comes one month after Anchor announced it was halting national distribution and discontinuing its beloved Christmas Ale, which it has produced since 1975. When Japanese beer giant Sapporo purchased Anchor in 2017, the company was already “in the red,” according to Singer, who said that revenue is down by two-thirds since 2016. The pandemic was especially challenging for the brewery, added Singer, as it typically sells most of its beer through bars and restaurants. The brewery attempted to expand its retail distribution but was “unable to break through in a big enough way,” he said.</p></blockquote><p> What a shame. “Drink local” is always good advice, and Anchor Steam in San Francisco was always delicious. I&#39;m not sure why they ever distributed Anchor Steam nationally, though — it was one of the worst-travelling beers I&#39;ve ever had. Local and fresh: delicious. Trucked to the east coast: meh. Before I tried it in San Francisco I always wondered what the fuss was about.</p><p> I knew something was wrong <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sdw/110704071761624623">when they debuted their absurd redesign</a> .

<p>No Apple action on Threads yet but Reuters reports some social media platform news:</p><blockquote><p> Tencent&#39;s WeChat said on Tuesday that iPhone maker Apple had opened a store on its social media platform, marking an expansion of the US firm&#39;s retail channels in the world&#39;s second largest economy. The announcement by WeChat, China&#39;s dominant messaging app which also provides e-commerce, livestreaming and payment services, said users would be able to buy Apple products including iPhones, iPads and Macs from the store.</p><p> China&#39;s smartphone sales in the first quarter fell 5% year on year, marking the lowest first-quarter sales figure for the country since 2014, according to data from Counterpoint Research. However, during the quarter Apple recorded a 19.9% share of the Chinese smartphone market — its biggest since 2014 — as it increased sales by 6% year-on-year in a declining market, the research firm said.</p></blockquote><p> WeChat&#39;s “everything app” dominance in China has no equivalent here.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Noel Philips, who reviews airlines on YouTube, ran into a problem trying to fly into Shanghai, because they wanted him to process his transit visa using WeChat — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD0D0eq9v40">but Philips theretofore hadn&#39;t even heard of WeChat</a> .

<p>When Twitter unceremoniously pulled the plug on third-party clients earlier this year, commercial Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific were left in a perilous position. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff" title="Tweetbot and Twitterrific Face the Cliff">I wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Twitter&#39;s kneecapping of third-party clients didn&#39;t just mean that their <em>future</em> revenue was gone — it meant <em>revenue they&#39;d already collected</em> from App Store subscriptions would need to go back to customers in the form of prorated refunds for the remaining months on each and every user&#39;s annual subscriptions. Consider the gut punch of losing your job — you stop earning income. It&#39;s brutal. Now imagine that the way it worked when you get fired or laid off is that you&#39;re also suddenly on the hook to pay back the last, say, 6 months of your income. That&#39;s where Tapbots and The Iconfactory are.</p><p> I can&#39;t recall a situation like this, with an ecosystem of third-party clients collecting subscriptions and then having the first-party service yank the carpet out from under them — and their customers — with zero warning or sunset period.</p></blockquote><p> Alas, this situation has become a recurring theme. Now it&#39;s <a href="https://apolloapp.io/">Apollo</a> , the exquisitely well-made Reddit client by Christian Selig. The situation is nearly identical: Apollo stopped working earlier this week, and Selig is on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in refunds to annual subscribers.</p><p> Just as with Tweetbot and Twitterrific, if you&#39;re a subscriber to Apollo, here&#39;s what you can do to support Selig:</p><ol><li> Reinstall Apollo if you&#39;ve already deleted it; otherwise, make sure you&#39;re running the latest version.</li><li> Tap the “I Don&#39;t Need a Refund” button.</li><li> Feel good and go buy yourself a treat, knowing you helped a talented developer (and nice person).</li></ol><p> Here&#39;s Selig, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/14nb5qs/today_is_apollo_for_reddits_last_day_and_i_just/">in his goodbye post on the Apollo subreddit</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It feels disingenuous on the surface to say “I want to thank all of you”, but in this case it&#39;s demonstrably true. I&#39;ve worked on this app for over 9 years, and I&#39;ve never felt burned out, I get such a crazy amount of energy and enjoyment out of building something so publicly alongside such an awesome community, and you seriously have no idea how easy product development is when your north star is just “listen to what people are saying”. [...]</p><p> I&#39;m really heartbroken with how this whole process unfolded, I truly drank the Kool Aid talking to Reddit at the beginning that this was something they were going into in good faith with the interest of developers, moderators, and the community as a whole, but as many people pointed out to me, it&#39;s clear now that ultimately wasn&#39;t their intent. If they wanted something that could work for everyone, they would have simply made an effort to listen, instead of being dishonest, callous, and punitive in pricing. I&#39;m sorry to all the folks who, like me, lost Apollo abruptly as a result of this. I had so much more I wanted to do with this app!</p><p> But, legitimately, I really feel a sense of that “Don&#39;t cry because it&#39;s over, smile because it happened” right now. I grew up so much developing Apollo, I met and learned from so many incredible people, made lifelong friends, got to go to multiple WWDCs and was even featured in a few, and I got to work on a product and platform I absolutely loved for 9 years. That&#39;s an incredible run, and it&#39;s hard to feel anything but thankful for that.</p></blockquote><p> In addition to the “I Don&#39;t Need a Refund” button, the final release of Apollo has a bunch of bonus content, including a few dozen wallpapers and some treats for Selig&#39;s other app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6443919232">Pixel Pals</a> . I find Selig&#39;s good spirits in the face of this debacle to be inspiring.

<p>Facebook&#39;s much-anticipated Twitter rival <a href="https://www.threads.net/">Threads</a> — branded “an Instagram app” — is out. Some initial thoughts and observations:</p><ul><li><p> The website&#39;s home page contains just a link to the apps for iPhone and Android, but you can view the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber" title="Threads profile page for my account, @gruber.">profile pages for users</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVYKiNxmWy/" title="Permalink to my first post on Threads, wherein I point out that just like its older sibling Instagram, the iOS app is only for iPhone, not iPad.">permalinks for posts</a> (threads?).</p></li><li><p> The iOS app only supports an iPhone layout. I suppose I should <em>not</em> find this surprising, given that 13 years after launching, Instagram&#39;s iOS app <em>still</em> doesn&#39;t support the iPad natively, but somehow I <em>do</em> find this surprising. What a fucking mystery for the ages it is that Instagram won&#39;t make iPad apps.</p></li><li><p> They&#39;re going with the “www” prefix on the web, just like Instagram. That feels archaic to me.</p></li><li><p> The website is view-only. You can&#39;t log in, post, or reply. No indication whether this is temporary or by design.</p></li><li><p> URLs are similar to Instagram&#39;s: domain name + “/t/” + unique post ID. (Where Threads uses a “/t/” (for <em>threads</em> ), Instagram uses a “/p/” (for <em>post</em> , I presume.) For example: <code>https://www.threads.net/t/CuRtcYTNY3J/</code> . Much better would be a URL format that includes the username of the poster, so you can tell who posted it just by looking at the URL. Example URLs that show attribution:</p><p> Twitter: <code>https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1667603292162240512</code><br /> Bluesky: <code>https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jznmowkftf2e</code><br /> Mastodon: <code>https://mastodon.social/@daringfireball/110652280163526529</code></p></li><li><p> Signing in was incredibly easy using my existing Instagram credentials, which were already on my phone because I have Instagram installed. I didn&#39;t even need to re-enter my password. Same username, same avatar, and I opted in to following the exact same accounts on Threads that I follow on Instagram.</p></li><li><p> The timeline is algorithmic — it shows you threads both from people you follow and from people you don&#39;t. Just after Threads went live to the public, my timeline was almost entirely from accounts I don&#39;t follow, seemingly users who&#39;ve been testing Threads while it was in beta. As I type this sentence a few hours later, however, my timeline is mostly from people I follow, and thus much more enjoyable. But as yet, there&#39;s no way to filter your timeline to <em>only</em> show threads from accounts you&#39;ve chosen to follow.</p></li><li><p> You can search for accounts, but there&#39;s no content search (yet?).</p></li><li><p> No hashtags (yet?) <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVKuinPTcH/">either</a> . Good riddance, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVWW5URH66/">I say</a> , but I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re forthcoming.</p></li><li><p> One feature Threads <em>has</em> launched with, though, are quote posts (retweets in Twitter parlance). Bluesky has them too. Quote posts are useful, fun, and central to the way many people use Twitter. And Mastodon doesn&#39;t have them — not by omission, but by design. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314523447694321" title="Me on Mastodon, back in early May, predicting that Bluesky will eclipse it in popularity.">As I&#39;ve quipped</a> , Bluesky feels like a new service for people who liked what Twitter used to be. Threads feels like that too. Mastodon feels like a service for people who hated Twitter, and nothing exemplifies that more than its lack of quote posting.</p></li><li><p> Posts are limited to 500 characters, which I think is the upper bound for a Twitter-like service.</p></li><li><p> No word about an API yet. I&#39;m not suggesting that Threads might offer an API to enable third-party clients — no way Facebook would do that — but there ought to be a programmatic interface for bots and such if they want to eclipse Twitter. ( <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVafQTvquB">Which Zuckerberg is already stating as a goal</a> .)</p></li><li><p> Speaking of Zuck, in addition to being <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/replies" title="Mark Zuckerberg's Threads account.">quite active</a> on Threads out of the gate, he posted to Twitter for the first time in 11 years, and <a href="https://twitter.com/finkd/status/1676747594460962817">it&#39;s perfect</a> .</p></li><li><p> Over 5 million people signed up for Threads in the first 4 hours after launch. (There are <a href="https://mastodon-analytics.com/">about 1.2 million active Mastodon users</a> .)</p></li><li><p> No ads yet. If Threads is successful, surely there will be ads. But in the meantime, it makes for a much better experience than Twitter, where the ads are frequent, large, <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1669783032558137344">and scammy</a> . (And they soon <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/yaccarino-sound-on-ads">might start playing sound</a> .)</p></li><li><p> The site/app seems a bit slow/flaky at the moment, but overall is holding up, and still seems faster than Mastodon.</p></li><li><p> Threads is available in over 100 countries, but not yet in the EU, <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/no-instagram-threads-app-in-the-eu-irish-dpc-says-metas-new-twitter-rival-wont-be-launched-here/a1927220337.html">thanks to their draconian and confusing Digital Markets Act</a> . Rather than forcing US and Asian companies to comply with their regulations, the EU seems more likely to be isolating its citizens from the broader world.</p></li><li><p> ActivityPub federation isn&#39;t supported yet but is forthcoming. Instagram chief <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuRtcYTNY3J">Adam Mosseri posted</a> :</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re committed to building support for ActivityPub, the protocol behind Mastodon, into this app. We weren&#39;t able to finish it for launch given a number of complications that come along with a decentralized network, but it&#39;s coming.</p><p> If you&#39;re wondering why this matters, here&#39;s a reason: you may one day end up leaving Threads, or, hopefully not, end up de-platformed. If that ever happens, you should be able to take your audience with you to another server. Being open can enable that.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h2> I Like Threads&#39;s Chances</h2><p> The overall vibe of Threads is probably not for me. It&#39;s not frantic, but it is busy, and very pop-culture-y. If you&#39;re the sort of person who wants a quiet timeline comprised only of posts from carefully curated accounts, Threads is not for you, and probably never will be. But the sort of people who like Twitter&#39;s “For You” feed and trending topics in the sidebar might find Threads more fun.</p><p> So I&#39;m bullish on Threads&#39;s chances for long-term success:</p><ol><li> The world needs, or at least wants, something like Twitter.</li><li> Twitter itself is falling apart under Musk.</li><li> Mastodon is inherently too confusing for mass market adoption, and in ways that can&#39;t be fixed without some central authority coming in and imposing a solution, which is against the fediverse&#39;s ethos. That doesn&#39;t mean Mastodon is doomed or bad. Just that it&#39;s never going to achieve mainstream popularity.</li><li> Bluesky — which is the one I&#39;m rooting for, personally — remains invitation-only as they scale and continue to define their underlying protocol.</li><li> All the other Twitter-like upstarts like <a href="https://post.news/">Post</a> and <a href="https://t2.social/">T2</a> and whoever else have no traction at all.</li><li> Threads starts with 1 billion eligible users, who already have their usernames, and can opt into following the exact same people they follow in Instagram, which is a product that continues to thrive and which people enjoy.</li><li> Facebook and Instagram know how to operate at the highest possible scales — both technically and regarding content moderation. Instagram&#39;s content moderation record is far from perfect, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/11/20/masnicks-impossibility-theorem-content-moderation-scale-is-impossible-to-do-well/">but content moderation at scale is impossible to do perfectly</a> . Facebook does it better than anyone, and much better than Twitter.</li></ol><p> I even like the name “Threads” — it&#39;s short, easy to spell, memorable, makes for a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/threads-icon.png">clever icon/logo</a> , and even starts with a “T”, reminding people of Twitter. The word <em>tweet</em> has been a nice thing for Twitter to have stumbled onto. (They didn&#39;t coin it; <a href="https://furbo.org/2013/06/28/the-origin-of-tweet/" title="Craig Hockenberry: ‘The Origin of Tweet’">Twitterrific did</a> .) <em>Tweet</em> works both as a noun and verb and everyone in the world knows what it means, whether they use Twitter or not. I don&#39;t think <em>thread</em> is going to take off as a verb for Threads, but it&#39;s a great noun for posts, and it reinforces the notion that you&#39;re supposed to engage with posts by replying.</p><h2> Elsewhere</h2><p> <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/meta-unspools-threads">Casey Newton has an interview with Mosseri</a> at Platformer. Regarding the EU, Mosseri said:</p><blockquote><p> The more pressing concern at the moment is to launch Threads in all the countries where Meta wants to. It won&#39;t be available in the European Union to launch as Meta works to ensure that Threads complies with the EU&#39;s new data privacy regulations.</p><p> “That&#39;s just going to take a while, unfortunately — and I&#39;m particularly frustrated about this point, because I&#39;ve been living outside of the US for a year now,” said Mosseri, who has been working from London. “I&#39;ve been on a total kick with my teams about stop launching things in only a couple countries, and not in other countries. … But in this case, it was either we wait on the EU, or delay the launch by many, many, many months. And I was worried that our window would close, because timing is important.”</p></blockquote><p> Regarding the opportunity for Threads, as Twitter self destructs, Newton writes:</p><blockquote><p> When the competition is an app <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/06/30/cisgender-twitter-musk-suspension/">where “cisgender” is considered a slur</a> , Threads has an easy time standing out as an oasis of calm and civility.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor">Mosseri also granted an interview to Alex Heath at The Verge</a> , where he had a thoughtful answer to the question of why Threads is a standalone app:</p><blockquote><p> It was a hugely contentious debate internally. You could be in feed. You could be a separate tab. You could be a separate app. The challenge with text posts in feed is that the post and comment model just fundamentally does not support public discourse as well as the model that Twitter pioneered with tweets and replies. Treating replies as equal as opposed to subordinate somehow just allows for a very different and much more broad range of public conversations. People do post text to Instagram all the time, even though we don&#39;t support it first class, and we&#39;re experimenting with that, too. That&#39;s great, but I think it solves a much smaller use case than public discourse more broadly.</p><p> Then there&#39;s a separate app versus separate tab. Separate tab is tough. There&#39;s only so much stuff you can shove in the app. It&#39;s already feeling too complicated. We&#39;re trying to actually simplify right now, and so it&#39;s certainly working against that. And generally, when you build a separate tab, you find you want to push all that distribution through a feed invariably in order to bootstrap it. You kind of end up right back in that first problem.</p><p> A separate app is way less likely to succeed because you have to bootstrap a user base from very little or from nothing. But if you do it, if you succeed, the upside is so much more significant.</p></blockquote><p> Lastly, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230705/p27#a230705p27">Techmeme&#39;s exhaustive compilation of coverage and commentary</a> .</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Threads</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
