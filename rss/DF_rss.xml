<p>CNBC 摘录了沃尔特·艾萨克森 (Walter Isaacson) 的<em>埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk)</em>的另一段摘录，讲述了马斯克和他的表兄弟将数千台服务器从萨克拉门托的一个数据中心迁移到波特兰的另一个数据中心的故事：</p><blockquote><p> “你必须聘请承包商来抬起地板，”亚历克斯说。 “它们需要用吸盘来举起。”他说，另一组承包商必须进入地板下方并断开电缆和地震杆。</p><p>马斯克转向他的保安，要求借用他的小刀。使用它，他能够抬起地板上的一个通风口，这使他能够撬开地板面板。然后他自己爬到服务器地板下，用刀撬开电气柜，拔掉服务器插头，然后等着看会发生什么。什么都没有爆炸。服务器已准备好移动。</p><p> “嗯，这看起来并不难，”他说道，乌兹别克人亚历克斯和其他人都盯着看。马斯克对此非常兴奋。他大声笑着说，这就像翻拍的<em>《碟中谍》</em>萨克拉门托版。</p></blockquote><p>一切都是一堆令人厌恶的事情，直到它变成了令人厌恶的事情：</p><blockquote><p>服务器上有用户数据，詹姆斯最初并没有意识到，出于隐私原因，它们应该在移动之前被清除干净。 “当我们了解到这一点时，服务器已经被拔掉并推出，因此我们无法将它们回滚，插入，然后擦除它们，”他说。另外，擦除软件无法运行。 “妈的，我们该怎么办？”他问。埃隆建议他们锁定卡车并跟踪它们。</p><p>因此，詹姆斯派人去家得宝购买大挂锁，然后他们将电子表格上的密码发送到波特兰，以便在那里打开卡车。 “我不敢相信它有效，”詹姆斯说。 “他们都安全抵达波特兰。”</p></blockquote><p>在某种程度上，深刻的紧迫感对领导者是有益的。尽管 CNBC 有这样的框架，但马斯克显然已经远远超出了这一点。整个努力是荒谬且不必要的鲁莽。除了侵犯隐私之外，不顾 Twitter 基础设施团队的直接建议将这些服务器从萨克拉门托撤出，还直接导致用户数月的不稳定。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“至少‘疯狂’这个词适合”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>高通宣布与苹果续签 5G 调制解调器协议</title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40226</id><published> 2023-09-11T15:54:05Z</published><updated> 2023-09-11T20:10:27Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg">影响市场的新闻</a>。当新闻在其他地方重新报道时，他们希望自己的独家新闻得到赞扬。所以相信我，他们将这一独家新闻归功于《华尔街日报》，这让他们很痛苦。但这就是彭博机构的白痴暴露的地方：查看上面引用中“报告”一词的链接。<em>提示：</em>它与爆料该消息的《华尔街日报》报道没有链接。]</p><blockquote><p>如果北京继续实施，史无前例的封锁将是多年来根除外国技术在敏感环境中使用的努力的顶峰，同时北京也在努力减少对美国软件和电路的依赖。</p></blockquote><p>这引起了我对这项法令的强烈好奇心。其中有多少是民族主义——中共对警察国家固有的沙文主义心态进行了调整——有多少（如果有的话）是因为iPhone是安全的，而它们的安全超出了政府的能力范围。中共？中国政府肯定希望监视政府雇员在手机上的行为，而 iPhone 让这变得更加困难。</p><p>最后，苹果与中国政府的独特关系在哪里发挥了作用？苹果公司仍然依赖中国制造，尤其是iPhone。他们<a href="https://bgr.com/tech/india-expected-to-assemble-1-in-10-iphone-15-models-in-2023/">在其他地方生产一些iPhone</a> ，但绝大多数是在中国组装的，目前世界上没有其他供应链可以取代它。对于任何谈判来说，这都是一个糟糕的起点。但是：中国从苹果那里得到了很多。在我的一生中，中国一直在努力改变人们对“中国制造”的看法。它总是意味着便宜。它曾经也意味着粗制滥造。苹果是中国帽子上的羽毛。 iPhone 不仅是世界上最好的手机，而且可以说是所有类别中最好、最复杂的量产消费品。而且它们几乎完全是在中国制造的。</p><p>中国政府肯定对<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-is-huaweis-new-smartphone-generating-so-much-buzz-2023-09-01/">华为在全球的贱民地位</a>感到愤怒，但任何中国公司都不可能获得苹果那样的声誉。华为手机<em>充其量</em>就是三流，这是所有人都知道的，包括中国的所有人。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-10"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-10">2</a></sup>如果中国保持与苹果的共生关系，中国将与世界上最负盛名的科技品牌保持牢固的联系。如果不是这样，苹果公司将其主要制造转移到其他地方，中国将再次下降到只与二流和三流产品联系在一起。更糟糕的是，在这种情况下，最好的公司也会选择放弃中国。中国从苹果公司获得了巨大的声誉；苹果公司因其对<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre">残酷</a><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/crackdown-in-xinjiang">侵犯人权的</a>共产主义独裁政权的依赖而受到声誉<em>打击</em>。</p><p>也许中国认为苹果<em>无法</em>消除对中国制造的依赖，所以可以随意对抗苹果。但即使这是真的，向其他考虑转向中国组装的公司（例如汽车制造商）传达的信息是：一旦你变得越来越依赖中国，我们就会像对待苹果公司一样对待你。中国想要向世界传达的信息不仅是中国是最有制造能力的国家，而且是值得信赖和可靠的合作伙伴。</p><p>苹果公司针对政府雇员使用 iPhone 的行为提出了相反的观点：中国作为合作伙伴不值得信任。</p><p>这就是我计算缓和情况的方法。如果苹果能够摆脱对中国制造的依赖，他们<em>可能会这样做</em>。但这样做的风险在于，这样做会惹恼习近平政权，而苹果公司在中国的消费品销售也会受到影响。 （也许这就是我们现在所看到的？）</p><p>但如果苹果真的放松对中国的依赖，中国可以用谁来取代他们呢？他们能把谁吹捧为依赖中国制造的世界级科技公司呢？第二名落后苹果太远了，你看不到它。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-10"><p>当然，彭博社是 2018 年 10 月发表“ <a

<p>Horace Dediu, writing at the newly refreshed Asymco:</p><blockquote><p> So the picture becomes clearer. The iPhone customer is <em>7.4 times</em> more valuable than the Android customer. This is more impressive than the 4× rule I had 10 years ago. The reasons are mainly that my anecdotes were from developers who sold products in the US or EU whereas expansion of smartphones to 7 billion global users has drawn in more lower spending customers.</p><p> But Apple&#39;s base has also grown to over 1 billion users (650 million store users). This highlights that Apple has effectively grown <em>and</em> discriminated customers effectively. It obtained not just 1 billion customers but <em>the best</em> 1 billion customers.</p><p> How to discriminate effectively is the holy grail of marketing. The naïve approach is to keep prices high. But that usually only results in a “luxury” branding and a small base that tends not to grow. The alternative “premium” approach is to offer functionality and multiple tiers and distribution options and financing and merchandising. There is no simple formula.</p></blockquote><p> I really enjoyed this piece, but I will quibble with “There is no simple formula”. It&#39;s the <em>execution</em> that is difficult and complex. But at a high level the formula Apple has applied to make the iPhone (and iPad) the unprecedented success that they are is remarkably simple.</p><p> First, make something people care deeply about. Computers are the biggest advance in human society since the industrial revolution; <em>revolution</em> is a strong word but it applied then and applies again today. People care about their computers and what they do on their computers very much, and they care most about the most personal of personal computers: their phones. They use them for communication, photography, entertainment (music and video), games, and more. They carry them almost everywhere they go, all day every day, and sleep next to them.</p><p> Second, make the best version of that thing people care deeply about. The people who care the most will perceive the superiority of your product, and gladly — not begrudgingly — pay a premium for it.</p><p> Third, keep iterating, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">tirelessly and continuously</a> , to improve that product year after year. Focus on aspects that cannot be copied or imitated. In the iPhone&#39;s case, those are things such as custom chips, superior hardware components and manufacturing techniques, software frameworks <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-deep-history-of-your-apps-steve-jobs-nextstep-and-early-object-oriented-programming/">decades</a> in the making, a culture that prioritizes great design, and an ever-expanding ecosystem that keeps customers in the flock <em>by making them happy</em> .

<p>Ian Betteridge:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is very good at taking a stand when it&#39;s easy. It refused to carry various small right-wing social platforms on its App Store, because the content moderation policies weren&#39;t up to scratch. Meanwhile, Twitter gets a pass despite having no practical control over hate speech and an owner who actively encourages it.</p><p> Should we be considering boycotting Apple and other companies that advertise on Twitter? Let&#39;s frame that another way: if you found out that a company was actively funding hate speech, would you want to buy products from them?</p><p> I know I wouldn&#39;t.</p></blockquote><p> Betteridge is without question correct that Apple is in a difficult position here. If you think it would be easy, recall last year, when Apple had drawn Musk&#39;s ire over the App Store&#39;s policies. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/30/cook-musk-apple-park">As I wrote then</a> , “Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.”</p><p> But it&#39;s hard to imagine any other ad venue — website, billboard, magazine, TV channel — where Apple would run ads that run alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/k_pendergrast/status/1697385443040653479">ads like this one</a> . No need for a statement. Just cease running ads on Twitter/X, and stop paying for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/29/hashmoji-iphone-15-apple-event/">these promotional “hashflags”</a> . When inevitably asked why, respond how Apple responds best: no comment.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Should Apple Cease Advertising on Twitter?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Little Musk Who Cries &#39;Wolf&#39; Daily Now Claims Twitter/X Is Going to Sue the Anti-Defamation League </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/04/elon-musk-to-sue-adl-for-falsely-accusing-him-x-of-antisemitism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v12" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40214</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:51:58Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T02:00:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Rebecca Bellan, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> In the newest uproar you might have missed, Elon Musk says X, formerly Twitter, will file a defamation lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League. Musk accused the ADL, an organization that works to combat antisemitism, extremism and bigotry, of falsely accusing him and X of being antisemitic.</p><p> “To clear our platform&#39;s name on the matter of anti-Semitism, it looks like we have no choice but to file a defamation lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League … oh the irony!” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698828606598734225">tweeted</a> the billionaire celebrity on Monday.</p><p> Musk also blamed the ADL for X&#39;s falling US advertising revenue. “Our US advertising revenue is still down 60%, primarily due to pressure on advertisers by @ADL (that&#39;s what advertisers tell us), so they almost succeeded in killing X/Twitter!” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698755938541330907">said Musk</a> .</p><p> Musk started off this latest tirade by claiming to be pro-free speech, but “against anti-Semitism of any kind.”</p></blockquote><p> Musk claims he&#39;s going to do all sorts of crazy shit. Sometimes he actually goes through with it, like the time he said he was going to buy Twitter and take it private. Most of the time, though, he doesn&#39;t. We need to stop reporting on what he says and focus mostly on what he does. Just two weeks ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">I began using this headline play on the proverbial Little Boy Who Cried Wolf</a> when Musk declared that Twitter/X was going to get rid of the block feature. He might still go through with that threat, but it hasn&#39;t happened, and I suspect it won&#39;t.</p><p> So why am I even linking to this threat against the ADL? Because what has already happened is odious and noteworthy. A weekend-long trending “BanTheADL” hashtag that not only wasn&#39;t suppressed, but was bolstered by Musk himself. Now this “ <em>It&#39;s all the Jews&#39; fault</em> ” excuse in the form of the lawsuit threat — it doesn&#39;t really matter if Musk follows through and sues (it&#39;d be a nonsensical suit), the damage is that Twitter&#39;s most popular user — who happens to own it — is openly courting antisemites.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Little Musk Who Cries ‘Wolf’ Daily Now Claims Twitter/X Is Going to Sue the Anti-Defamation League’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;The MacOS App Icon Book&#39; by Michael Flarup </title><link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-macos-app-icon-book" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v11" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40213</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:06:46Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T19:06:47Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Speaking of Kickstarter projects, Michael Flarup is working on a sequel to his outstanding <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> — this one dedicated to Mac app icons. Given my interests, I&#39;d have been delighted by <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> even if it had merely been pretty good. But it&#39;s a splendid book — carefully curated, exquisitely well-designed, and very nicely printed and bound. It&#39;s no small trick to reproduce icons meant for screens in a printed book. <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> is also very well-written and considered, particularly regarding the seminal design shift introduced by iOS 7 in 2013.</p><p> So a sibling volume dedicated to Mac app icons? Hell yes.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘The MacOS App Icon Book’ by Michael Flarup’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Studio Neat&#39;s Keen: The World&#39;s Best Box Cutter </title><link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/keen-a-compact-durable-and-retractable-utility-knife" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v10" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/studio-neat-keen" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40212</id><published> 2023-09-05T17:39:10Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T02:02:38Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>New from the dynamic duo at Studio Neat: Keen, a $95 box cutter.</p><p> Yes, a box cutter/utility knife that costs about $100. A $100 tool to replace the sort of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lnchett-12-Pack-Retractable-Cardboard-Mechanism/dp/B07DXTP9M9/?tag=df-amzn-20">disposable thing</a> that costs like a $1 a pop. Until about a year ago, those disposable plastic jobbies were what I used, and I kept losing them. About a year ago, after losing track of the last one in my office, it occurred to me that I lose them because I don&#39;t care about them. I already owned a nice keychain-sized pocket knife from The James Brand, which I love, so I bought <a href="https://thejamesbrand.com/products/the-palmer">the Palmer</a> , their $59 box cutter. 11 months later and I haven&#39;t misplaced it once. And I&#39;m happier for owning it: it&#39;s way nicer to use than any disposable I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p> A few weeks ago, though, my pals at Studio Neat sent me a pre-production Keen. I prefer it to the Palmer in every single regard. First, it&#39;s thinner and smaller, but in no way <em>too</em> small. Second, it&#39;s easier to change the blade. But most importantly, the Keen offers a completely original design for opening and closing the blade: a spring-loaded slider. It&#39;s so different from any box cutter design I&#39;ve ever seen that I wondered if I&#39;d even like it at all, let alone prefer it, because it does not lock into place. Turns out though I <em>much</em> prefer it. It feels both more convenient and safer, because it&#39;s impossible to leave the blade extended while you aren&#39;t holding it. And when released, it springs back so quickly that if you drop it, the blade will retract by the time it lands.</p><p> Pens are so cheap you can get them free at most bank counters, but many people who care spend more to get a really nice one. (Studio Neat, in fact, has you covered there as well, if you&#39;re interested, with their <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone">Mark One</a> and <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/marktwo">Mark Two</a> . Me personally, I remain devoted to the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/6387">$1.75 Zebra Sarasa</a> .) A box cutter is no different. Given how many packages I receive each and every week of the year, it&#39;s one of my most-used tools. So why not buy the best? The Kickstarter is already fully-funded, but the eventual retail price will be around $25 higher than the Kickstarter price.</p><p>也可以看看：</p><ul><li><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5bFsyRSTp4">Chase Reeves made a fun little YouTube video about the Keen</a> .</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C3J93DWH/?tag=df-amzn-20">These ceramic utility razor blades</a> are sharper than steel ones, supposedly last longer, and work especially well with the Keen in that they aren&#39;t attracted by the Keen&#39;s magnetic closure.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Studio Neat’s Keen: The World’s Best Box Cutter’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/studio-neat-keen">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://ohdear.app/?via=daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0z" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/09/oh_dear" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40211</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-09-04T21:46:16Z</published><updated> 2023-09-10T19:55:09Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The Iconfactory:</p><blockquote><p> All of us here at the Iconfactory love the classic video games we played in our youth. Many hours were spent in front of titles like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol">Moon Patrol</a> , and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)">Battlezone</a> , as well as cherished handheld electronic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/N14UCRZsN3U?si=ewAgv7QK9J9RWeD_">Mattel Football</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/NI4yTsvauTs?si=S7RtQUvxLD2FVEUG">Simon</a> , and <a href="https://youtu.be/m-OkKHxH1xo?si=Voc2r1s8taEHx_v7">Merlin</a> . Ollie&#39;s Arcade recaptures a little bit of this magic and gives players a chance to turn their iPhone or iPad into a retro gaming experience.</p><p> Two of the games in Ollie&#39;s Arcade — Ollie Soars and Tranquility Touchdown — were inspired by simple Easter eggs in <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2023/01/twitterrific-end-of-an-era/">Twitterrific</a> , our beloved Twitter app. We polished Tranquility Touchdown, completely revamped Ollie Soars, and added an all-new third game — our own take on the classic Snake. All of Ollie&#39;s mini-games are easy to learn and designed to be accessible for everyone. You can even play with your favorite game controller or via wireless keyboard.</p></blockquote><p> Ollie Soars is free of charge; the other two games are just $2 each. What a novel idea: pay once, play them forever. Tranquility Touchdown gets so many little details from the vector graphics arcade era right.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ollie’s Arcade’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/ollies-arcade">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Pleading the Fifth&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/08/31/ep-384" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/the-talk-show-384" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40208</id><published> 2023-09-03T22:53:40Z</published><updated> 2023-09-03T22:53:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-thunderbolt-cable/">Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple may offer a USB-C data transfer accessory cable for iPhone 15 Pro models that is capable of Thunderbolt or USB4 speeds of up to 40Gbps. That is <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1694893349705240598">the latest claim made by Kosutami</a> , who posted details of the cable on Twitter (now X). According to the leaker, the length of the cable is 0.8 meters, which is shorter than <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN713AM/A/thunderbolt-4-pro-cable-18-m">Apple&#39;s existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a> (1.8m), and it is said to support charging up to 150W. Apple will allegedly sell the cable separately.</p></blockquote><p> Lest you think it nickel-and-dime-y for Apple to sell a Thunderbolt 4 cable separately, note that Thunderbolt 4 cables are <em>expensive</em> . <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/thunderbolt-cable">Apple currently sells two</a> : the 1.8m one costs $129, and the 3m one costs $159. I bought a 0.8m one made by Razor last year, with very similar feel and quality to Apple&#39;s, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TGBF6DK/?tag=df-amzn-20">that Amazon currently sells for $46</a> . (That&#39;s a make-me-rich affiliate link, if you&#39;re in the market for a Thunderbolt 4 cable.) A 1m Thunderbolt cable from Monoprice (rubber, not braided) <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=44117">costs $30</a> . Apple&#39;s own 0.8m Thunderbolt 3 cable costs $39. I&#39;m guessing this new 0.8m Thunderbolt 4 cable from Apple will cost $99. It&#39;d be downright silly for Apple to include an expensive (and thick, stiff, and short) cable like that with every iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p> The reason to even offer such a cable, and to offer Thunderbolt 4 performance on the phones, is for data transfer, specifically video. The single biggest frustration regarding iPhones sticking with Lightning until this year is that 4K video files are <em>very</em> large, but USB 2.0 data transfer is <em>very</em> slow. iPhones have been capable of shooting 4K video since the 6S models in 2015, and as their image quality has improved each year, the data transfer limitations of Lightning has seemed more and more incongruous. <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-29">1</a></sup></p><p> I ran into this twice, when we used iPhones to shoot the COVID-era episodes of The Talk Show Remote From WWDC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg9F1Qjv3iU&amp;t=6s">in 2020</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SzbucgATjA">and 2021</a> . The footage looked great, but it took hours to transfer it off the phones. Heretofore, iPhones have offered pro-quality video cameras limited to decidedly consumer-level data transfer rates.</p><p> Speaking of “pro”, though, faster data transfer speeds might literally be capital-P Pro features this year. Hardwick continues:</p><blockquote><p> Speculation therefore remains rife about the USB-C port capabilities of the iPhone 15 lineup, and nothing is certain beyond the switch from Lightning. Rumors suggest the cables supplied in iPhone 15 boxes are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-usb-c-cable-usb2-transfer-speeds/">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> at a rate of 480 MBps, which is the same as Lightning.</p><p> In contrast, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to be supplied with cables capable of USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 transfer speeds, as per Kuo&#39;s original claim. Images from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/some-iphone-15-models-feature-thunderbolt-speeds/">ChargerLab</a> suggest that some iPhone 15 models will include a Thunderbolt/USB 4 retimer chip, seemingly confirming the rumor of higher-speed data transfer for the Pro models.</p><p> Each iPhone 15 will include a braided USB-C charging cable in the box that is thicker (ie more durable) and 50% longer than the Lightning cable that comes with current iPhone models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/">according to reports</a> . The cables are also rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">color-matched</a> to possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/five-iphone-15-color-options-to-expect/">new iPhone colors</a> , coming in at least black, white, yellow, blue, and orange.</p></blockquote><p> Even most Pro-model iPhone buyers never transfer data over a cable, so differentiating the iPhone 15 Pro models from the non-pro ones in this way feels fair. Including color-matched braided cables with all new models would be a nice touch (and lines up with other recent products, like the M1 iMacs and M2 MacBook Airs, that ship with color-matched braided cables). But the fact that some of these phones (the non-pro ones) might support only USB 2 speeds (480 Mbps), while others (the Pro models) will support up to Thunderbolt 4 (40 Gbps — roughly 80× faster), yet all the ports and cable connectors will look the same to the naked eye, only goes to show just how confusing “USB-C” is. Glenn Fleishman&#39;s headline from 2021 remains as apt as ever: “ <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/12/03/usbefuddled-untangling-the-rats-nest-of-usb-c-standards-and-cables/">USBefuddled: Untangling the Rat&#39;s Nest of USB-C Standards and Cables</a> ”.</p><hr /><p> While I&#39;m writing about the switch to USB-C, let me make a prediction how this will be received when it&#39;s officially announced in two weeks. The small number of filmmakers who shoot using iPhones (small compared to the aggregate number of iPhone users overall) will rejoice. The larger number of nerds, and even semi-nerds, who travel with multiple computing devices and just want USB-C charging connectors on all them will be happy. But the vast silent majority of normal iPhone users? I think there&#39;s going to be a backlash that most USB-C proponents don&#39;t see coming, premised on accusations that this switch is a money grab from Apple to get people to replace all their Lightning cables with new <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/usb-c-cable?src=globalnav">$30 USB-C cables from the Apple Store</a> .</p><p> <em>You</em> , dear reader, of course know that USB-C is an industry standard and you can buy <a href="https://www.anker.com/collections/usb-c?ref=naviMenu">high-quality cables</a> from <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/category/cables/usb-&amp;-lightning-cables/usb-c-cables">stores</a> other than Apple. I don&#39;t think everyone knows that. And even those who will buy their new USB-C charging cables from companies other than Apple are likely to grouse about the need to buy new cables at all.</p><p> When Apple switched from the 30-pin iPod connector to Lightning with the iPhone 5 in 2012, there was a <em>lot</em> of grousing. And that was a port switch where you could easily <em>see</em> how much better the new one was. (The old 30-pin connector and port really do look absurd to modern eyes.) At a glance USB-C doesn&#39;t look any better than and barely different from Lightning. My gut feeling is that not much has changed since 2012 on the “new iPhone connector” front, other than the fact that there are, quite literally, over a billion more iPhone users today than then, and thus perhaps <em>billions</em> of extant Lightning cables in use. Typical users put more value on being able to just keep using the old cables (and chargers) they already have <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-29">2</a></sup> — at their bedsides, in their kitchens, on their desks, in their cars, in their backpacks and purses — than reducing the number of different <em>types</em> of cables they need in their lives.</p><p> I don&#39;t know how many people are going to be irritated, if not downright angry, about this switch, but it&#39;s going to be a <em>lot</em> more people <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-29">3</a></sup> than most “ <em>the iPhone should have already switched to USB-C</em> ” proponents expect. Me, I&#39;ll gladly take the vastly-improved data transfer speeds. But I won&#39;t be the one answering the phone at 1-800-MY-APPLE.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-29"><p> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2391101/what-it-was-like-filming-unsane-on-an-iphone-according-to-the-cast">Steven Soderbergh shot the feature film <em>Unsane</em> using iPhone 7&#39;s in 2017</a> .

I think they wanted to introduce MagSafe first, let people accumulate a few MagSafe cables in the places where they charge their iPhones, and then switch from Lightning to USB-C. Three years of iPhones (12, 13, 14) have already had MagSafe, so that&#39;s about an average upgrade cycle for most users. But anecdotally, the normals in my family don&#39;t use MagSafe, they use Lightning, probably because the cables are cheaper. <a href="#fnr2-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-08-29"><p> And a lot more clickbait-y “Look What Apple Is Forcing iPhone Users to Buy” headlines. <a href="#fnr3-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 3。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Idle Speculation on the Widely-Assumed Switch to USB-C Ports on the Upcoming iPhones 15</title></entry><entry><title> Apple Announces &#39;Wonderlust&#39; Event on Tuesday 12 September </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/29/apple-wonderlust" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40203</id><published> 2023-08-29T17:00:02Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T17:37:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Apple&#39;s Developer News site has a nice interview with three indie developers who&#39;ve visited the Vision Pro labs, including Michael Simmons from <a href="https://flexibits.com/">Flexibits</a> and David “Underscore” Smith, of <a href="https://www.david-smith.org/apps/">Widgetsmith</a> fame:</p><blockquote><p> For his part, Simmons saw Fantastical work right out of the box. He describes the labs as “a proving ground” for future explorations and a chance to push software beyond its current bounds. “A bordered screen can be limiting. Sure, you can scroll, or have multiple monitors, but generally speaking, you&#39;re limited to the edges,” he says. “Experiencing spatial computing not only validated the designs we&#39;d been thinking about — it helped us start thinking not just about left to right or up and down, but beyond borders at all.”</p></blockquote><p> Simmons&#39;s remarks echo my biggest takeaway from my demo experience: the lack of a “frame” encompassing windows.</p><blockquote><p> And as not just CEO but the lead product designer (and the guy who “still comes up with all these crazy ideas”), he came away from the labs with a fresh batch of spatial thoughts. “Can people look at a whole week spatially? Can people compare their current day to the following week? If a day is less busy, can people make that day wider? And then, what if like you have the whole week wrap around you in 360 degrees?” he says. “I could probably — not kidding — talk for two hours about this.”</p></blockquote><p> Two hours, you say? <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/04/30/ep-345">I know a guy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inside the Apple Vision Pro Developer Labs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/inside-vision-developer-labs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface </title><link href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40200</id><published> 2023-08-28T18:45:16Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T21:58:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Remember <em>last</em> year at WWDC, when Apple previewed the next generation of CarPlay, with support for screens that span the entire dashboard? Here&#39;s a MotorTrend report on the 2024 Porsche Cayenne SUV. <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay?slide=2">Slide 2</a> shows a CarPlay interface that I had first wrongly presumed spans the entire dashboard, but in fact does not.</p><p> <strong>Update 1:</strong> A few readers have chimed in to suggest this is <em>not</em> next-gen CarPlay 2, it&#39;s just extended use of CarPlay 1. It&#39;s definitely improved, but it is not the new stuff Apple previewed last June. My question: If this is <em>not</em> CarPlay 2, when, if ever, will we actually see a carmaker announce CarPlay 2 support? ( <em>Voice from the cheap seats: “When Apple makes their own car.”</em> )</p><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/28/hands-on-porsche-new-carplay-app/">Here&#39;s a hands-on report by Jameson Dow</a> for 9to5Mac from last month:</p><blockquote><p> We got a chance to test out some of its features on a 2024 Cayenne, and it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve felt an Apple-like experience from software made by a traditional automaker.</p><p> We&#39;re still waiting for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/03/new-carplay-interface-features-release/">next-gen CarPlay experience</a> which Apple announced last year, which promises greater integration with vehicle functions than today&#39;s version of CarPlay. In the meantime, though, Porsche has taken it upon itself to build its own app which offers the best of both worlds — a snappy, CarPlay-like user interface, along with control of some vehicle functions which were heretofore unavailable through Apple&#39;s software.</p></blockquote><p> So it might be the best CarPlay interface yet to ship in a car, but it&#39;s <em>not</em> the next-gen CarPlay announced by Apple last year. It&#39;s just CarPlay in the middle with other displays showing built-in stuff from Porsche based on <a href="https://www.porscheirvine.com/research/porsche-communication-management.htm">PCM</a> , their own in-house software platform.</p><p> <strong>Update 3:</strong> I&#39;ve now received feedback from three different readers who&#39;ve all said more or less the same thing: they paid extra for these extra screens in their Cayennes or Taycans, and the software experience on them is terrible. They regret paying for it. “A wasted useless screen” said one.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40199</id><published> 2023-08-28T17:28:39Z</published><updated> 2023-08-28T17:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.

<p>Clay Risen, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> John Warnock, a founder of Adobe Systems whose innovations in computer graphics, including the ubiquitous PDF, made possible today&#39;s visually rich digital experiences, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 82.</p><p> The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started in 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.</p></blockquote><p> It was just a month ago that pancreatic cancer took Kevin Mitnick, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip">I remarked</a> on how many people this specific cancer has taken of late.</p><blockquote><p> Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an arduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on either a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or a specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $10,000 and take up most of a room.</p><p> Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop printers themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer sent them. Adobe&#39;s first such protocol, PostScript, went into Apple&#39;s revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a few years it was the industry standard.</p><p> PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware companies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely unknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a program designed to render and read files in what it called a Portable Document Format, or PDF.</p></blockquote><p> PDF was an enormous breakthrough, and is more relevant today than ever. A true document format for the ages. But Adobe was well on its way before 1993. <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/02/20/a-blast-from-the-past-demos-of-adobe-photoshop-1-0/">Photoshop 1.0 launched in early 1990</a> . They began shipping their library of original <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5141">PostScript fonts and the essential Adobe Type Manager software</a> in 1989. And Illustrator 1.0 launched back in 1987, shipping with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjPTMfVBDh0">this video tour demonstrated by Warnock himself</a> .</p><p> Warnock and Geschke understood what Steve Jobs often preached: technology alone was not enough. PostScript was — <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html">and remains</a> ! — excellent technology. But it was not a product. The LaserWriter was a product. You hooked it up, went to File → Print in <em>any</em> application, and you got professional-grade 300 DPI output with no technical expertise necessary. It was as easy to print high-quality output on a LaserWriter as it was to print junk output on a slow, noisy dot-matrix printer. <em>That</em> was a product.</p><p> And Illustrator turned PostScript from a rather difficult but highly-capable programming language into a tool designed for use by artists. They didn&#39;t just make a nice code editor for writing PostScript. They created an app that presented a visual framework in which you directly manipulated shapes, lines, and curves as objects. Even expert Illustrator users were never exposed to PostScript directly. The Illustrator metaphor was a complete <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/eps-file.html">encapsulation</a> . That too was a product, and Illustrator remains an essential tool. If Warnock and Geschke had been satisfied merely with shipping great technology alone, Adobe Systems would be a nearly forgotten Silicon Valley footnote. Instead, they pushed to make Adobe the great tool-making product company we know today.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Adobe Co-Founder John Warnock Dies at 82’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/26/john-warnock-rip">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Threads Web App Launches </title><link href="https://www.threads.net/@threads/post/CwVVlQlOe53" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/threads-web" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40196</id><published> 2023-08-25T23:16:06Z</published><updated> 2023-08-26T19:25:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> In the battle between iPad and Mac, I&#39;m a longtime member of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2016/02/ipad-vs-mac-im-on-team-both/">Team Both</a> — I use my Mac most of the day at my desk, but when I write elsewhere in the house or backyard, I switch to an iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard case. And that iPad (in a regular case) is my primary computing device when I&#39;m not in work mode.</p><p> I&#39;m not at all ready to declare the “use iPad to get work done” experiment dead. With the forthcoming release of iPadOS 17, Stage Manager has thrown in a bunch of improvements that suggest the iPad&#39;s progression to more functional status continues, albeit at a pace that&#39;s a bit too slow for my liking.</p><p> But here I sit at my mother&#39;s dining room table, typing on a MacBook Air. Something has changed in my approach to travel, and I&#39;m trying to understand just what it is and what it tells me about the trajectory of the iPad as a productivity tool.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve written <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air">at length</a> , multiple times, about my decidedly mixed feelings regarding the iPad — most stridently in January 2020, in a piece titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10">The iPad Awkwardly Turns 10</a> ”. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/stage+manager">Stage Manager</a> is the biggest change to the iPad interface since I wrote that, and its existence certainly helps on that “power user” front. (And Stage Manager sees some <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/with-ipados-17-stage-manager-is-finally-moving-in-the-right-direction/">nice improvements</a> in this year&#39;s iPadOS 17.) But for me personally, I continue to find that I&#39;m most productive when I spend my working time in front of my Mac. Gobs of people thrive using their iPads for writing and other creative endeavors. But I know I&#39;m best off, productivity-wise, using my iPad basically as a single-tasking consumption device for long-form reading and video watching.</p><p> The reason this topic remains evergreen is that I <em>want</em> to use my iPad more. There&#39;s something ineffable about it. It&#39;s a thrill when I use my iPad to do something that an iPad is actually best at. I honestly think I&#39;d be more productive if I owned no iPad at all, yet I keep trying to find ways to use it more.</p><p> So when I travel, it&#39;s never a question whether I&#39;ll pack my MacBook Pro. Even if I don&#39;t plan or want to work during a particular trip, the one-man-show nature of Daring Fireball means I feel that I need to be able to. (I was on a family vacation, preparing to head to dinner, when <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned">this news broke 12 years ago yesterday</a> .) The question is whether I even pack my iPad Pro at all, or just go it alone with iPhone and Mac. When I&#39;m packing, I generally wind up tossing the iPad in my bag, thinking I&#39;ll miss it if I don&#39;t. But when I do just leave the iPad at home, I don&#39;t miss it. It&#39;s confounding, though, because I&#39;m going on a trip next week and I bet I&#39;ll take my damn iPad.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Giving Up the iPad-Only Travel Dream’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/ipad-only-travel-dream">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Lends Support to California &#39;Right to Repair&#39; Bill </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/?guccounter=1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40194</id><published> 2023-08-25T00:50:13Z</published><updated> 2023-08-25T22:46:08Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Brian Heater, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> In a surprise move, Apple this week penned a letter to California state senator Susan Talamantes Eggman, voicing support for SB 244, a “right to repair” bill currently making its way through Sacramento&#39;s State Capitol building. [...] Apple has, of course, softened its stance on right to repair legislation in recent years, including last year&#39;s addition of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/iphone-14-and-m2-macs-get-added-to-apples-self-service-repair-program/">Self Service Repair program</a> . The offering, which was viewed by many as a preemptive measure against looming state and federal legislation, provides users with rental tools to repair iPhones and Macs at home.</p><p> In the letter, Apple expresses its support on the grounds of offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, without risking privacy or data issues. “Apple supports California&#39;s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “We create our products to last and, if they ever need to be repaired, Apple customers have a growing range of safe, high-quality repair options.”</p><p> This sort of backing from a specific manufacturer is unusual — particularly from Apple. It is thus far the only major manufacturer to express its support for the bill in this manner. These kinds of statements are generally made through industry consortiums, such as TechNet.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find Apple&#39;s support for this legislation surprising, but <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230823/p29#a230823p29">most people commenting on it do</a> .</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110943929863426254">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This is less of a pivot and more of just accepting reality.</p><p> Apple pushing aesthetics such as no seams in their phones over consumer benefits like being able to replace your phone&#39;s batteries has been deemed unacceptable by a number of governments including the EU.</p><p> Regulation is coming whether they like it or not, so they might as well get some positive PR for “supporting” the regulations.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/">Jason Koebler, writing at 404 Media</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple told a California legislator that it is formally supporting a right to repair bill in California, a landmark move that suggests big tech manufacturers understand they have lost the battle to monopolize repair, and need to allow consumers and independent repair shops to fix their own electronics.</p></blockquote><p> Koebler&#39;s use of “monopoly” hints at the assumption that authorized repairs are a profit center. That is true for some manufacturers in some industries. Koebler himself has copiously documented <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware">the saga with John Deere tractors</a> . All <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">the nonsense</a> inkjet printer makers go through to try to keep people from using third-party replacement ink cartridges is another. That&#39;s never been Apple&#39;s reason for opposing these laws. Apple&#39;s stance is more about control.</p><p> And I&#39;d argue that Obasanjo is missing the possibility that Apple actually thinks California&#39;s SB 244 is a well-written law. Would Apple prefer no such law at all? I think the answer is obviously yes. Providing all the necessary documentation, tools, and parts for every new device the company makes is a pain in Apple&#39;s corporate ass, and I think <em>that’s</em> why Apple resisted such legislation. From their perspective any such law is an unnecessary annoyance. But it&#39;s undeniably reasonable for there to be consumer protection laws, and if there are going to be Right to Repair laws that cover computing devices, those laws ought to be good ones. And the plain language of Apple&#39;s letter is that the company thinks this is a good one.</p><p> I highly doubt we&#39;re going to see any such letter from Apple to the EU endorsing their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/25/22996248/apple-sideloading-apps-store-third-party-eu-dma-requirement">Digital Markets Act</a> , the law that, among numerous other sweeping provisions, is poised to mandate sideloading on all phones. Apple continues to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/23/apple-opposes-eu-plans-to-make-common-charger-port-for-all-devices">oppose</a> the EU law requiring USB-C ports in all rechargeable devices, and that law is already passed. Apple has complied, begrudgingly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with the Netherlands&#39;s rather specific regulations regarding dating apps</a> and in-app payments — but they&#39;ve issued no praise for the law.</p><p> If Apple <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23925286-apple-support-sb-244">says they support California&#39;s SB 244</a> , it probably just means they actually support it.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Lends Support to California ‘Right to Repair’ Bill’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Apple Buying Disney Isn&#39;t the Fairy Tale It Once Was&#39; </title><link href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2032120/apple-disney-merger-netflix-growth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/snell-apple-disney" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40193</id><published> 2023-08-24T22:14:23Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T22:14:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>A Jason Snell daily double — this time his Macworld column, speculating on rumors of an Apple acquisition of Disney:</p><blockquote><p> If this sounds outlandish, well, if I traveled back in time to 2011 and told you that Apple would be producing some of the best TV shows in the world, wouldn&#39;t that seem bizarre? And yet the company has grown and changed–and will continue to.</p><p> But leaving the growth aside for a moment, there&#39;s also this: Apple and Disney <em>do</em> have ties. They do feel similar in so many ways. From the Imagineers working on new Disneyland features to the VFX artists at Industrial Light &amp; Magic to the animators at Pixar, so much of Disney is located at the same intersection of Technology and the Liberal Arts that Apple calls home. (And when I look at the bill for my last family trip to Disneyland, I recognize that both companies are very good at charging me a lot of money.)</p></blockquote><p> Last week when I was working — slowly, as ever — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree">on my own take</a> on the Apple-Disney speculation, I saw in my feed reader that Snell had published his own take. So, I averted my eyes until I finished my own. Glad I did, because I&#39;m not sure I would have been able to resist lifting that keen observation about both companies residing at the intersection of Technology and the Liberal Arts. That&#39;s exactly why this whole notion, though unlikely, <em>feels</em> like a “but, well ... <em>maybe</em> ” idea.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Apple Buying Disney Isn’t the Fairy Tale It Once Was’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/snell-apple-disney">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;How the iMac Saved Apple&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/23830432/imac-twenty-five-years-ago-saved-apple" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/how-the-imac-saved-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40192</id><published> 2023-08-24T22:07:10Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T22:26:31Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing at The Verge last week, marking the iMac&#39;s 25th anniversary:</p><blockquote><p> Upon its release, the iMac became so well known that it may have even eclipsed the Apple brand for a little while. It was at least a strong enough signifier that Apple began using it on other products. The iBook laptop was an obvious choice, but in 2001, the company chose to reuse the branding for its new music player, the iPod.</p><p> The iPod didn&#39;t connect to the internet, but it didn&#39;t matter. Apple was declaring that the “i” stood for another cool Apple product you&#39;d want to buy, and people bought an awful lot of iPods. Apple began slapping the lowercase “i” in front of a lot of its hardware, software, and services, culminating in the release of the iPhone and iPad.</p></blockquote><p> An astute remembrance of a seminal product. Snell rightly emphasizes how controversial some of the iMac&#39;s features were: the lack of a floppy disk drive and dropping all legacy I/O ports in favor of USB. The branding power of that “i” prefix remains so strong that I still hear people calling Apple Watches “iWatches”.</p><p> In hindsight it seems obvious that Jobs and Ive would go on to create not just numerous great new products, but to do so in new (or at least new to Apple) product categories. But they had to start somewhere. The easiest way for Apple to have failed upon Jobs&#39;s return would have been to shoot for the moon out of the gate. The next big things would come. First, they rightly decided to focus on righting the ship that was Apple&#39;s <em>previous</em> big thing: a desktop personal computer. Everything the company has designed, built, and shipped since can be traced back to that Bondi Blue surprise.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘How the iMac Saved Apple’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/how-the-imac-saved-apple">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/kouvakas_uk_surveillance" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0f" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40191</id><published> 2023-08-24T01:20:01Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T01:20:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> What will actually happen, I believe, is that E2EE messaging platforms like WhatsApp (overwhelmingly popular in the UK), Signal, and iMessage *will stop working and be pulled from app stores in the UK*, full stop.

<p><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/87615/changes-to-uk-surveillance-regime-may-violate-international-law/">Ioannis Kouvakas, writing for Just Security</a> :</p><blockquote><p> While the proposal does not specify what technical changes would require notification, these may include changes in the architecture of software that would <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revised-investigatory-powers-act-notices-regimes-consultation/consultation-on-revised-notices-regimes-in-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016-accessible-version#proposed-changes">interfere</a> with the UK&#39;s current surveillance powers. As a result, an operator of a messaging service wishing to introduce an advanced security feature would now have to first let the Home Office know in advance. Device manufacturers would likely also have to notify the government before making available important <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66256081">security updates</a> that fix known vulnerabilities and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/managing-deployed-devices/keeping-devices-and-software-up-to-date">keep devices secure</a> . Accordingly, the Secretary of State, upon receiving such an advance notice, could now request operators to, for instance, abstain from patching security gaps to allow the government to maintain access for surveillance purposes.</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly where I&#39;ve thought, for months, that the United Kingdom is heading with this legislation, but it&#39;s still shocking to see it described so starkly. It&#39;s like watching someone drive toward a cliff, and warning people, “ <em>Hey, I think these guys are driving right toward that cliff</em> ” — and yet I&#39;m still taken aback to see them drive off the cliff.</p><p> It&#39;s a complete fantasy that E2EE can be toggled like a light switch and still allow messages to be delivered. The end-to-end encryption isn&#39;t a sugar coating, some sort of extra layer of protection — it&#39;s fundamental to the messaging protocols themselves. It has to be, when you think about it. If it were possible for, say, Signal, to silently disable E2EE but still have messages go through, how could users ever trust the service? You could neither trust that what you were sending would be delivered securely, nor that what you received wasn&#39;t intercepted by an interloper. There&#39;s an explicit guarantee with all of these E2EE messaging platforms <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">that messages can <em>only</em> go through securely</a> . Removing E2EE wouldn&#39;t require some mere tweak to the protocols, it would require replacing the protocols entirely (with inherently insecure ones).</p><p> And the notion that security updates, for every user in the world, would need the approval of the UK Home Office just to make sure the patches weren&#39;t closing vulnerabilities that the government itself is exploiting — it boggles the mind. Even if the UK were the only country in the world to pass such a law, it would be madness, but what happens when other countries follow?</p><p> As I see it, the most likely outcome is that the UK passes the law, <em>thinking</em> that the grave concerns conveyed to them by the messaging services are overblown. That the platform providers are saying they <em>can&#39;t</em> comply but they really just mean they don&#39;t <em>want</em> to comply because it&#39;s just difficult, not impossible. And when it becomes law, the platforms will hand it off to the nerds, the nerds will nerd harder, and boom, the platforms will fall into compliance with this law. That&#39;s what they <em>think</em> will happen. What will actually happen, I believe, is that E2EE messaging platforms like WhatsApp (overwhelmingly popular in the UK), Signal, and iMessage <em>will stop working and be pulled from app stores in the UK</em> , full stop. The UK seems to think it&#39;s a bluff; I don&#39;t.</p><p> Perhaps the argument — as made by Kouvakas — that these changes would run afoul of international law will resonate with the UK in a way that technical arguments, thus far, have not.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;Changes to UK Surveillance Regime May Violate International Law&#39;</title></entry><entry><title> Rewatch </title><link href="http://www.rewatch.com/resources/daring-fireball/?utm_source=daring-fireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=daring-fireball-newsletter-q3-2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/20/rewatch" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40189</id><published> 2023-08-20T04:39:24Z</published><updated> 2023-08-20T04:39:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Speaking of Twitter/X, Eric Seufert, writing on Threads:</p><blockquote><p> Twitter has seen a dramatic decrease in its Top Downloaded chart position across both platforms since the app was renamed to X. Why? The situation presents a fascinating case study at the intersection of brand equity and mobile platform dynamics.</p><p> The case is somewhat unprecedented: Twitter built a ubiquitous, household-name brand over the course of nearly 2 decades and then simply abandoned it, leaving it to be exploited by competitors, unopposed, through the mobile platforms&#39; branded search ads. [...]</p><p> My hypothesis is that, while the terminally-online are entirely aware of Twitter&#39;s rebrand to X, most consumers aren&#39;t, and their searches for “Twitter” on platform stores surface ads and genuine search results that are in no way redolent of Twitter.</p></blockquote><p> So if you don&#39;t know that Twitter changed its name to X, and search for “Twitter”, the top result is a paid ad from a competitor (Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, etc.), and the result for X doesn&#39;t look anything like Twitter. It doesn&#39;t have the name, doesn&#39;t say “formerly Twitter”, and isn&#39;t even blue. It&#39;s just the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@joannastern/post/CwAxVOGL8Cz/">ugly X icon</a> and the insipid slogan “Blaze your glory!”</p><p> At this moment, Threads is #2 on the App Store&#39;s top free downloads list, and X is #51. On the Play Store, Threads is #6 and X is ( <em>scroll, scroll, scroll...</em> ) #66. This rebranding would be a firing offense if the mastermind behind it didn&#39;t own the company.

The news comes despite the fact that Amazon <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-renewed-season-2-amazon-1235518073/">renewed the show for a second season</a> back in February. The series, based on the William Gibson novel of the same name, debuted on Amazon on Oct. 21, 2022.</p><p> It starred Chloë Grace Moretz and hailed from executive producers Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan under their rich overall deal with Amazon. According to an individual with knowledge of the situation, the decision to not move forward with the second season was heavily influenced by the ongoing writers and actors strikes. In essence, even if the show was to go back into production soon, Season 2 would not be available until close to if not into 2025. [...]</p><p> “The Peripheral” was the first series to debut under Nolan and Joy&#39;s deal with Amazon, which is reportedly worth $150 million. The duo are also prepping a series based on the video game franchise “Fallout,” though that project does not yet have a premiere date. Production was reportedly finished on the series earlier this year.</p></blockquote><p> This sucks. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-Season-1/dp/B0B8TFMYXZ">The Peripheral</a></em> season 1 was really good: smart, entertaining, surprising, great characters and cast. It looked good too. Nolan and Joy were the team behind HBO&#39;s <em>Westworld</em> , and <em>The Peripheral</em> was both stylistically and thematically similar — but just better. It&#39;s like Nolan and Joy took another crack at the same thing. It&#39;s so good I suggest watching it even knowing that there&#39;s no future, and thus it ends very unsatisfyingly.</p><p> I&#39;m pissed that Netflix dropped <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80214497">1899</a></em> after just one season, but knowing that <em>1899</em> has no future, I&#39;m a bit more reluctant to suggest watching it — it wasn&#39;t nearly as good as <em>The Peripheral</em> . But we&#39;re all <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">used to this from Netflix</a> . Sad to see Amazon go that route.</p><p> And I don&#39;t get how the writer and actor strikes justifies this decision at all — <em>everything</em> is going to be delayed by these strikes. This just seems like Amazon <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-05/amazon-ceo-asks-his-hollywood-studio-to-explain-its-big-spending?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=aPhxMSeh">getting cheap after they blew billions</a> on a shitty <em>Lord of the Rings</em> show and the big expensive letdown <em>Citadel</em> .

<p>Adi Robertson, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Elon Musk says X&#39;s — formerly Twitter&#39;s — block feature is on the chopping block, repeating his long-standing gripe against the basic social networking feature. “Block is going to be deleted as a &#39;feature&#39;, except for DMs,” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558414105186796">said in an X reply</a> on Friday. He followed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558493255942213">another post</a> : “It makes no sense.”</p></blockquote><p> Twitter founder and multi-time former CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1692583743884509668">Jack Dorsey</a> (capitalization <em>sic</em> ): “💯. mute only.”</p><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety">Apple&#39;s App Store Guidelines</a> :</p><blockquote><p> 1.2 User-Generated Content</p><p> Apps with user-generated content present particular challenges, ranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous bullying. To prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or social networking services must include:</p><ul><li> A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the app</li><li> A mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concerns</li><li> The ability to block abusive users from the service</li></ul></blockquote><p> Excerpted from <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9876937?hl=en">Google&#39;s Play Store Policy Center on “User Generated Content”</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apps that contain or feature UGC, including apps which are specialized browsers or clients to direct users to a UGC platform, must implement robust, effective, and ongoing UGC moderation that:</p><ul><li> Conducts UGC moderation, as is reasonable and consistent with the type of UGC hosted by the app; [...]</li><li> Provides an in-app system for reporting objectionable UGC and users, and takes action against that UGC and/or user where appropriate;</li><li> Provides an in-app system for blocking UGC and users;</li></ul></blockquote><p> Both platforms thus require social media apps to support users being able to block other users. Google&#39;s language is unambiguous. The rub is how “blocking” is defined. If all Musk wants to do is changing blocking to mean that blocked users can still <em>see</em> tweets from users who blocked them, but can&#39;t interact (reply, quote, retweet) with them, I think that&#39;s fine. Blocked users can see those tweets by just opening a private/incognito browser tab as it stands. But if Musk wants to truly “delete” the block feature, he&#39;s going to run right into Apple and Google&#39;s app store rules. Google is arguably stricter than Apple about enforcing UGC rules, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1129024148/google-truth-social-trump">having kept Donald Trump&#39;s Truth Social app out of the Play Store for months</a> (after it was available in Apple&#39;s App Store) citing insufficient content moderation.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Little Musk Who Cries ‘Wolf’ Daily Claims X Will ‘Delete’ the Block Feature, But No One Knows What That Even Means’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_strategy_charts" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v05" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40181</id><published> 2023-08-18T03:59:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T21:52:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Disney was, and should remain, a serious engineering company. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> co-host Ben Thompson referenced <a href="https://kottke.org/15/06/walt-disneys-corporate-strategy-chart">this famous 1957 Disney org/strategy chart</a> in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/disneys-taylor-swift-era/">a (very good) Stratechery post</a> this week. I just now added a link to it in the footnote regarding company org charts in my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree">Disney/Apple piece</a> from yesterday, but it feels worth a post of its own.</p><p> At the center of the Disney business in the 1957 chart were theatrical films. Everything else — TV, music, magazines and comics, and the then-new Disneyland — funneled into and revolved around the theatrical films.</p><p> Lesser known is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthunterross/7973803710/in/pool-978039@N25/">this 1967 revision</a> . Or at least lesser known to me — I hadn&#39;t seen it before today. Walt Disney died in 1966, so this chart reflects the company as he left it. The differences from the 1957 chart that strike me:</p><ul><li><p> Disneyland moved closer to the core of the company, nearly rivaling the motion picture studio in centrality.</p></li><li><p> “Disney World Florida” is tucked down in the corner, but wouldn&#39;t open until October 1971. The trend is obvious: theme parks (including, eventually, <a href="https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/">floating ones</a> <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-17">1</a></sup> ) would replace movies as the core of the company.</p></li><li><p> Unfamiliar to me was a box named “Mineral King”, illustrated with a skiing Goofy. <a href="https://yesterland.com/mineralking.html">Turns out this was to be a ski resort in Sequoia National Forest</a> in California, with land rights granted by the National Forest Service in 1965. Embroiled in lawsuits from the no-fun Sierra Club for a decade, Disney abandoned the project in 1976.</p></li><li><p> “Comic strips” are listed separately from “publications” on both charts. I&#39;m old enough to remember reading the newspaper comics page daily, but not old enough to remember when Mickey and pals were on them. Pre-TV, a daily newspaper comic strip filled the role that social media does today: a free way to engage everyone with small nuggets of entertainment. <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-17">2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p> Lastly, WED Enterprises — aka Imagineering — is a big part of the 1967 chart, but wasn&#39;t even listed on the 1957 one. [ <strong>Update:</strong> WED was a private company owned by Walt, personally, until 1965, which explains its omission from the 1957 chart for the Disney company.] Disney was, and should remain, a serious engineering company. In 1967, WED engineers were creating everything from theme park animatronics to transportation systems. Sounds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">familiar</a> .

<p>Kim Masters and Alex Weprin, writing for The Hollywood Reporter under the headline “ <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-apple-deal-1235559416/">A Disney Sale to Apple? Don&#39;t Count It Out This Time</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> There clearly is no buyer like Apple, which is sitting on $62 billion in cash and cash equivalents and has a $2.8 trillion market cap. And while it may be very true that Apple doesn&#39;t want to buy <em>a</em> studio, maybe it would want to buy <em>this</em> studio — the one that, despite the challenges of the moment, has a vault full of priceless IP and remains the most valuable brand in entertainment.</p><p> And there has been a long-standing “special relationship” between Disney and Apple: Steve Jobs served on Disney&#39;s board of directors from 2006 until his death in 2011. Iger joined Apple&#39;s board shortly after Jobs died. He resigned from that position Sept. 10, 2019, the same day Apple officially announced that it was getting into the content business through its Apple TV+ service.</p></blockquote><p> I do not think Apple has any interest in buying Disney. Apple frequently acquires small companies — on average, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56178792">about once per month</a> . Many of these acquisitions are so quiet they get no press coverage whatsoever, which is how Apple likes it. When acquisitions <em>are</em> noted, the company <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q="Apple+buys+smaller+technology+companies+from+time+to+time,+and+we+generally+do+not+discuss+our+purpose+or+plans"&amp;ia=web">has a boilerplate response</a> : “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” They&#39;d need a longer statement if they bought Disney.</p><p> Beats, of course, was the exception to the rule. <a href="#fn3-2023-08-16">At $3 billion in 2014</a> , it remains, by far, Apple&#39;s largest-ever acquisition. Disney&#39;s current market cap is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=DIS+market+cap+on+15+august+2023">$158 billion</a> . I&#39;m in no way arguing that Apple couldn&#39;t afford to buy Disney, even at a generous markup, but rather that enormous industry-shuffling acquisitions like that aren&#39;t what Apple does, nor, in my opinion, should do. Apple has a very distinct company culture and focus. PA Semi, which Apple acquired with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/04/23/pa-semi">relatively little fanfare</a> for a mere $278 million in 2008, is Apple&#39;s style of acquisition. Apple is not comprised of divisional fiefdoms like Microsoft, <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-16">1</a></sup> which is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/microsoft-activision-agree-to-extend-deal-deadline-to-oct-18.html">buying Activision for $69 billion</a> , or Amazon, which bought its way into the grocery store market by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/how-whole-foods-has-changed-in-the-five-years-since-amazon-took-over.html">acquiring Whole Foods for $14 billion</a> . Manu Cornet&#39;s <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/organizational-charts">classic 2011 comic strip illustrating tech company org charts</a> remains apt, and is only funny because it&#39;s accurate. <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-16">2</a></sup></p><p> Disney, too, has a very distinct company culture and focus. And there are some obvious areas where Disney&#39;s and Apple&#39;s cultures overlap: they are both family-friendly iconic brands with outsized cultural influence, with reputations for industry-leading design and engineering. What each company does, they strive to do <em>best</em> . And because they prioritize quality over all else, both companies have built enormous devoted customer bases that are really more like <em>fan</em> bases. The reason the notion of an Apple-Disney acquisition has any legs at all is that it&#39;s not crazy. If Apple <em>were</em> to buy a major entertainment/media company, they&#39;d probably want Disney. Why drink Veuve Clicquot when you can afford Dom Perignon? If you&#39;re going to buy, buy the best. <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-16">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnr4-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn4-2023-08-16">4</a></sup></p><p> And if Disney were to look for a buyer, I can&#39;t think of a single big-enough-to-afford-it company other than Apple that they would <em>want</em> to sell to. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-disney-stock-brand-snow-white-mickey-2022-2">Berkshire Hathaway</a> is the only other big-enough company I can think of that might be trusted to let Disney be Disney. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/">Berkshire today holds no Disney stock at all</a> , which strongly suggests Warren Buffett would have no interest in buying the whole company at its current price. Berkshire does, though, own 6 percent of Apple&#39;s stock, <sup id="fnr5-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn5-2023-08-16">5</a></sup> so they would, by proxy, own a sizable stake in Disney if ... Apple bought Disney.</p><p> I just don&#39;t think Apple has any such interest or appetite. Nor do I think Disney envisions its own future as anything but the independent company it has been ever since Walt and Roy Disney founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio 100 years ago.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-16"><p> Microsoft and Apple, forged in the image of their founders, have long been opposites in so many regards. Their contrasting strategies regarding large acquisitions exemplify that. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft">Microsoft has made eight acquisitions larger than Apple&#39;s $3 billion purchase of Beats</a> (all prices in billions): Activision Blizzard ($69), LinkedIn ($26), Nuance ($20), Skype ($8.5), ZeniMax ($8.1), GitHub ($7.5), Nokia ($7.2), and aQuantive ($6.3). I&#39;d even toss in Minecraft-maker Mojang at $2.5 billion, which is just under the price Apple paid for Beats. Would Microsoft consider buying Disney? I think they might, especially if Disney&#39;s stock dips further. (Let&#39;s put aside the regulatory hurdles such a deal would obviously face — Microsoft seems to relish such battles.) Microsoft is big in gaming, of course, but stands alone amongst Apple, Amazon, and Google with no foothold in streaming video. Would Disney consider selling itself to Microsoft? I sure hope not. <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-16"><p> Although I think that if redrawn today, Meta/Facebook&#39;s cartoon org chart ought to look more like a cross between Apple&#39;s and Amazon&#39;s. The buck stops with Zuck. And while we know the bullseye in the 2011 Apple chart was Steve Jobs, Apple&#39;s organization today is not <em>that</em> much more hierarchical than it was then. I&#39;d draw it more like a small council in the center, rather than a singular figure. But it&#39;s still spoke-and-hub.

Practically speaking the timing would seemingly have made it impossible. Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion January 2006, a full year before the iPhone was announced. Apple was thriving by that time — the Mac had completed its software transition from classic Mac OS to Mac OS X, and was beginning its hardware transition from PowerPC to Intel; the iPod was a cultural sensation and smash hit; and the company&#39;s foray into its own retail stores was proving to be an, <em>err</em> , genius decision. But Apple circa 2006 was not <em>acquire another company for $7.4 billion</em> thriving. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/10/11Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results/">In October 2005 Apple announced its then-best-ever financial year</a> : $14 billion in revenue, $1.3 billion in profit. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/10/amid-tech-industry-fears-apple-reports-record-q4-results/">Apple&#39;s fiscal 2022</a> , for comparison: $316 billion in revenue, and a smooth $100 billion in profit. Apple today generates more profit every 5 days than it did in the entire year of 2006. Apple&#39;s market cap in January 2006: $60 billion. Today: $3,000 billion.</p><p> Not to mention that Apple had no strategic reason to acquire Pixar in 2006. Apple TV+ didn&#39;t launch until 2019. The iTunes Store didn&#39;t even start renting movies <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/188954/itunesrent.html">until 2008</a> . Jobs selling Pixar (in which he owned over $1 billion in stock at the price it sold to Disney) to Apple would have looked fishy, to say the least. Also not to mention that Disney held unique leverage over Pixar&#39;s ability to shop itself to other potential suitors — Disney didn&#39;t own Pixar, but they did own the intellectual property for all of the movies Pixar had made to date: <em>Toy Story</em> , <em>A Bug&#39;s Life</em> , <em>Monsters Inc.</em> , <em>Finding Nemo</em> , <em>The Incredibles</em> , and the then-upcoming <em>Cars</em> , <em>Ratatouille</em> , <em>WALL-E</em> , and <em>Up</em> . Buying Pixar without acquiring those rights would have been like, well, buying Disney today without acquiring Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Star Wars, and Marvel.</p><p> But if we wave all that inconvenient historical timing away, in the abstract it&#39;s easy today to imagine Pixar as a film studio ( <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/pixar-adobe-apple-autodesk-and-nvidia-form-alliance-for-openusd/">and engineering</a> ) subsidiary of Apple. It would be both a perfect cultural and strategic fit. <a href="#fnr4-2023-08-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回正文中的脚注 4。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn5-2023-08-16"><p> I was well aware that Berkshire Hathaway owns a 6 percent stake in Apple, but until I looked at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/">this list of its holdings</a> , I had no idea that Berkshire&#39;s Apple holdings account for 46 percent of its entire portfolio. That&#39;s not to say Apple accounts for 46 percent of Berkshire&#39;s entire value — only its public stock holdings. But still, that&#39;s astonishing. Warren Buffett has <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2022ltr.pdf">always measured Berkshire&#39;s success</a> against the S&amp;P 500. Apple is currently weighted at about 7 percent in the S&amp;P 500.
