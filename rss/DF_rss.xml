<p>我很高兴两周前<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_pencil_usb-c" title="有一款带有 USB-C 端口的新款 Apple Pencil，我的想法转向了整个 iPad 产品线的复杂性">我抱怨了当前 iPad 系列的复杂性</a>。三支铅笔，与复杂的 iPad 型号矩阵兼容。 iPad Pro 型号的前置摄像头位于短边，但第 10 代非专业 iPad 已更新，前置摄像头位于长边，这是专业用户想要的。这是一团乱。</p><p>我很高兴，因为现在我有一个反例可以指出，随着 M3 系列芯片的推出，一个广泛的产品阵容近乎完美：MacBook。以下是我对苹果产品阵容的看法： <sup id="fnr1-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn1-2023-11-06">1</a></sup></p><ul><li><strong>预算：</strong> 13英寸M1 MacBook Air：999美元</li><li><strong>消费者：</strong> M2 MacBook Air：<ul><li> 13 英寸：1,100 美元</li><li>15 英寸：1,300 美元</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pro Jr.：14</strong>英寸 M3 MacBook Pro：1600 美元</li><li><strong>专业专业版：</strong> M3 Pro MacBook Pro<ul><li> 14 英寸：2,000 美元</li><li>16 英寸：2,500 美元</li></ul></li><li><strong>工作站级 Pro：</strong> M3 Max MacBook Pro<ul><li> 14 英寸：3,200 美元</li><li>16 英寸：3,500 美元</li></ul></li></ul><p>这个阵容清晰、干脆、不错。 MacBook Air 价格在 1,000 美元至 2,000 美元之间；配备 M3 Pro 的 MacBook Pro 价格范围为 2,000 美元至 3,000 美元，配备 M3 Max 的 MacBook Pro 价格范围为 3,000 美元至<em>yowza 美元</em>。 （配备 M3 Max（16 核 CPU、40 核 GPU）、128 GB RAM 和 8 TB SSD 的最大 16 英寸 MBP 售价为 7,200 美元。）</p><p>苹果 MacBook 系列中的通配符就是我厚颜无耻地称之为“Pro Jr”的产品。模型。在过去的几年里，这款笔记本电脑一直是带有 Touch Bar 的 13 英寸 MacBook Pro，大多数专家用户认为这款笔记本电脑根本不应该存在，但苹果公司表示，它是该公司第二畅销的笔记本电脑。有<em>很多</em>买家想要一台 MacBook Pro，即使他们不需要（或不想付费）真正专业的性能规格。</p><p>随着上周推出配备普通 M3 芯片的 14 英寸 MacBook Pro，苹果已经修复了这一层。我经常注意到，当苹果公司将一款产品描述为“专业”时，它有几个不同的含义——有时意味着<em>专业</em>，但有时意味着<em>更好</em>或<em>更好</em>。普通的 M3 MacBook Pro 体现了后一种含义。它拥有与其 M3 Pro 和 M3 Max 兄弟姐妹相同的行业最佳 14 英寸显示屏、相同出色的 6 扬声器音响系统以及相同的现代外形。从各方面来看，它都是一款名副其实的“MacBook Pro”，即将进入 2024 年。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn2-2023-11-06">2</a></sup></p><p>新款 14 英寸 M3 MacBook Pro 和它所取代的 13 英寸 M2 MacBook Pro 之间的一个主要区别是价格：13 英寸 M2 MBP 起价为 1,300 美元；新款 14 英寸 M3 MBP 起价为 1,600 美元。这是一个显着的跳跃，但也是有道理的。首先，今年 6 月在 WWDC 上推出的新款 15 英寸 M2 MacBook Air 现在占据了价格矩阵中“起价 1,300 美元”的位置。其次，它<em>被</em>命名为“Pro”。</p><h2> M3 Pro 和 M3 Max</h2><p>随着 M1 和 M2 代 Apple Silicon 的推出，消费级 Mac 比配备 Pro 和 Max（以及桌面系统 Ultra）芯片变体的专业型号提前几个月推出：</p><ul><li><p> M1 芯片于 2020 年 11 月<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/introducing-the-next-generation-of-mac/">在 MacBook Air、13 英寸 MacBook Pro 和 Mac Mini 上首次</a>亮相。这些 Mac 的外形尺寸均与其搭载英特尔芯片的前代产品相同。</p></li><li><p> M1 Pro 和 Max 以及新的 14 英寸和 16 英寸“缺口显示屏”外形尺寸<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-m1-pro-and-m1-max-the-most-powerful-chips-apple-has-ever-built/">于近一年后的 2021 年 10 月首次亮相</a>。</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/07/all-new-macbook-air-with-m2-available-to-order-starting-friday-july-8/">M2 芯片于 2022 年 7 月在新型 13 英寸 MacBook Air 中首次亮相</a>。该 M2 芯片也同时出现在带 Touch Bar 的 13 英寸 MacBook Pro 中。</p></li><li><p> M2 Pro 和 Max <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/01/apple-unveils-macbook-pro-featuring-m2-pro-and-m2-max/">于 2023 年 1 月在更新的 14 英寸和 16 英寸 MacBook Pro（以及 Mac Mini 中的 M2 Pro）中首次亮相</a>。普遍的共识是这些机器迟到了，原本计划在 2022 年末发货，但事实是它们是在今年 1 月发货的。</p></li></ul><p>因此，在 M1 一代中，Pro 和 Max 型号的发货时间比普通 M1 晚了近一年。对于 M2，Pro 和 Max 型号比普通 M2 晚大约 6 个月发货。</p><p>现在，随着 M3 一代的出现，M3、M3 Pro 和 M3 Max 相继亮相，而普通的 M3<em>仅</em>在售价 1,600 美元的新款“Pro Jr”中首次亮相。 14 英寸 MacBook Pro。考虑到所有因素，这是有道理的：您可能会认为第一批配备新一代芯片的笔记本电脑将是高端笔记本电脑，而不是消费者价格的笔记本电脑。我怀疑我们在 M1 和 M2 代中看到的是 Apple 芯片更新的副产品——推出新的 PC 芯片架构的本质是，Apple 首先使用“更简单”的芯片，然后才是“更难”的芯片。 。但现在他们已经在这个领域徘徊了几次，并成功引导了全新的 PC 架构，现在他们已经能够凭借最重要的 M 系列芯片占据领先地位：面向专业人士的专业芯片MacBook。</p><p>我预计我们将在春季看到 M3 MacBook Air，无论是在 3 月或 4 月的特别活动中，还是在 WWDC 上。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn3-2023-11-06">3</a></sup>可能与此同时，我们也会看到台式机系列（Mini、Studio 和 Pro）也转向 M3 系列。 （即使 M3 Ultra“只是”两个 M3 Max 桥接在一起，那也应该是一个相当不错的芯片，拥有多达 32 个 CPU 核心、80 个 GPU 核心和 256 GB 的 RAM 上限。如果 M3 Ultra<em>超过</em>那...拿你的爆米花。）</p><p>此外，我认为这将是今后 M4、M5 和未来几代产品的模式：首先是 MacBook Pro，然后是 MacBook Air 和台式机。从营销角度来看，这更有意义。 MacBook Pro 是性能优化的笔记本电脑，专业笔记本电脑的销量远远超过专业台式机。</p><p>在 M1 和 M2 代中，Pro 芯片基本上是 Max 芯片的一半。 M3 芯片的情况并非如此。从广义上讲，M3 Pro 更像是增强版的普通 M3，而 M3 Max 则完全不同。查看按性能和效率核心划分的 CPU，以下是每个芯片的最佳配置：</p><ul><li> M3：4/4</li><li> M3 Pro：6/6</li><li> M3 最大：12/4</li></ul><p> M3 Pro 型号面向的是我认为 MacBook Pro 买家的最佳选择，在性能和效率核心之间取得了平衡。 M3 Max 型号显然面向需要最高性能的专业人士。总共 16 个 CPU 核心听起来并不比 12 个多多少，但 M3 Max 核心在性能和效率方面的分配并不均匀——它们严重偏向于性能核心。</p><p>还有 M3 Pro（总共 11 个 CPU 核心：5 个性能核心/6 个效率；14 核 GPU）和 M3 Max（总共 14 个 CPU 核心：10 个性能、4 个效率；30 核）的较小（<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/glossary-binning-definition,5892.html">大概</a>是分箱）变体图形处理器）。所有这些芯片的 RAM 选项在带宽和容量方面都各不相同：</p><ul><li> <strong>M3：</strong> 2个RAM芯片，100 GB/s内存带宽：<ul><li> 2 × 4 GB = 8 GB</li><li> 2 × 8 GB = 16 GB</li><li> 2 × 12 GB = 24 GB</li></ul></li><li> <strong>M3 Pro：</strong> 3个RAM芯片，150 GB/s内存带宽：<ul><li> 3 × 6 GB = 18 GB</li><li> 3 × 12 GB = 36 GB</li></ul></li><li> <strong>M3 Max配备14核CPU：</strong> 3个RAM芯片，300 GB/s内存带宽：<ul><li> 3 × 12 GB = 36 GB</li><li> 3 × 32 GB = 96 GB</li></ul></li><li> <strong>M3 Max配备16核CPU：</strong> 4个RAM芯片，400 GB/s内存带宽：<ul><li> 4 × 12 GB = 48 GB</li><li> 4 × 16 GB = 64 GB</li><li> 4 × 32 GB = 128 GB</li></ul></li></ul><p>这些 RAM 选项还清楚地表明，M3 Pro 更像是增强版的普通 M3，而 M3 Max 则是不同的野兽。 M3 Pro 提供了更多 RAM 的选项，速度比基准 M3 快 1.5 倍。 M3 Max 提供了<em>更多</em>RAM 的选项，速度提高了 3 倍或 4 倍。</p><p>乍一看，看到“M3 系列 MacBook Pro”支持 8、16、18、24、36、48、64、96 等 RAM 层以及高达 128 GB 的 RAM，您可能会感到不知所措。但一旦你把注意力集中在特定的 CPU 上，你实际上就只有两三个 RAM 的选择。我对 RAM 唯一的抱怨是：</p><ul><li><p>如果基础 M3 型号的起始内存为 16 GB，而不是 8 GB，那就太好了。从任何意义上来说，8 GB 都不给人“专业”的感觉。但我们不能忽视苹果的利润率和营销方面的诱惑，即降低价格点。保持利润率不变，但将基本 RAM 提高到 16 GB，意味着入门型号的起价为 1,800 美元；将价格保持在 1,600 美元，但将 RAM 提高到 16 GB 将大大侵蚀该型号的利润——该型号再次成为苹果第二畅销的 Mac。我们都喜欢花蒂姆·库克的钱，但他是十多年来一直经营着世界上最赚钱的公司的人。如果你对仅仅 8 GB 的 RAM 感到不爽，那就多付 200 美元吧。</p></li><li><p>我个人属于这样的类别，我的第一性能需求是 RAM，因为我倾向于打开数十个应用程序和数百个 Safari 选项卡。就我的 CPU 和 GPU 需求而言，我认为我不会注意到 M3 Pro 和 M3 Max 之间的差异。但要获得大量 RAM（这是计算机科学术语），您需要购买 M3 Max 型号。我希望 M3 Pro 至少多一种 RAM 配置，例如 3 × 16 GB = 48 GB。这仍然会将 64 GB 及以上的配置留给 M3 Max，但对于那些最大的高级用户需求是 RAM 的人来说，这将是一个不错的选择。</p></li></ul><p>这些极端的选择都不便宜。配备 16 核 M3 Max 和 40 核 GPU 的 14 英寸 MacBook Pro 起价为 3,700 美元；配备相同芯片的 16 英寸型号起价为 4,000 美元。该芯片的<em>基本</em>RAM 为 48 GB，是普通 M3<em>最大</em>RAM 的两倍。从 48 GB RAM 升级到 64 GB 的成本为 200 美元（对于一台大约 4,000 美元的计算机来说，这确实是微不足道的）；不过，从 48 GB 升级到 128 GB 需要花费 1,000 美元。</p><h2>表现</h2><p>过去五天我测试了配备 M3 Max 的 14 英寸 MacBook Pro，配备 16 核 CPU、40 核 GPU、64 GB RAM 和 2 TB SSD。这是一个 4,300 美元的配置。不便宜，但你确实得到了你所付出的代价：这台机器绝对尖叫。</p><p>我最喜欢的基准测试是<a href="https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.1/">基于浏览器的 Speedometer</a> （当前版本 2.1）。 Web 浏览器渲染非常耗费资源，部分原因是现代 HTML、CSS 和 Javascript 非常复杂，部分原因是大多数 Web 开发人员都是非常缺乏才华且粗心的程序员。 <sup id="fnr4-2023-11-06"><a href="#fn4-2023-11-06">4</a></sup> Javascript 是一种单线程语言，因此 Web 浏览器渲染本质上与 CPU 的单核性能相关。多核性能很重要，但对于大多数用户的大多数任务来说，单核性能更重要。车速表可以测量这一点。我的结果是多次运行的平均值：

差异之外，这些结果彼此一致。我怀疑 Cinebench 2.7 倍的差异将更能代表现实世界的结果，但这只是一种预感。但可以公平地说，M3 Max 以及整个 M3 代产品“足够快”。在短短两年内，与同类 MacBook Pro 相比，这些都是非常可靠的改进。</p><p>苹果自己的营销材料与基于英特尔的 Mac 进行了几点比较，这才是新款 MacBook Pro 真正的亮点。这对英特尔这家公司来说并不完全公平，因为自苹果上次在 2019 年推出配备英特尔笔记本电脑芯片的新款 Mac 以来，英特尔的笔记本电脑芯片当然已经变得更快了。但这与所有仍在使用基于英特尔的 Mac 的 Mac 用户完全相关，他们，据我在 Apple 采访过的人士透露，Mac 的用户群中仍占大多数。 Mac 的升级周期很长——更像是汽车的升级周期，而不是手机的升级周期。那些推迟升级到 Apple Silicon 硬件的 Mac 用户一旦升级，将会大饱口福。</p><p>我要指出的是，我唯一一次听到 M3 Max MacBook Pro 的风扇噪音是在运行 Cinebench 基准测试时。机器很热，不热，但风扇的声音绝对是可以听到的。 Cinebench 是长期运行的基准测试，每个基准测试需要 10 分钟。在实际使用中，我一次也没有听到过风扇的声音，就像苹果硅 Mac 上常见的情况一样。</p><h2>深空黑</h2><p>不出所料，值得庆幸的是，我的评测单位是深空黑色——这是一种仅适用于 M3 Pro 和 M3 Max 型号的新颜色选项。所有新款 M3 系列 MacBook Pro 均有银色可供选择，但常规 M3 型号的深色选项与旧的深空灰色相同。</p><p>苹果的产品摄影在准确传达这种“太空黑”有多暗方面非常公平——尽管它的名字是这样的，但它是一种非常深的灰色，而不是黑色。但为什么不是<em>黑黑</em>呢？苹果公司生产了大量真正黑色的铝制设备。我想到了 iPhone 7——<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/09/apple-introduces-iphone-7-iphone-7-plus/">有亮光黑和哑光黑两种颜色</a>。我只能推测，这是苹果认为最适合 MacBook Pro 的深色——总体而言，任何较暗的颜色看起来都会更糟。我内心有一部分希望看到它更暗，但这已经足够暗了，我可以相信，再暗也不会看起来更好。</p><p>我热爱它。我的个人 Mac 是深空灰色 14 英寸 M1 Max MacBook Pro，配备 64 GB RAM（该机器的最大 RAM 分配）。我没有正当的性能相关理由升级到 M3 Max MacBook Pro，但我非常想要，只是因为我渴望这种太空黑色的外观。并排放置时，这款深空黑色 M3 MacBook Pro 使我的深空灰色 M1 MacBook Pro 看起来像银色。深空灰色 MacBook 只是颜色更深<em>而已</em>。太空黑，虽然不是黑色，但实际上是<em>黑暗的</em>。这是一个表面的方面，但却很重要。如果没有，苹果就会把它们全部变成银色，然后就到此为止了。</p><p>苹果多年来在 MacBook 和 iPad 上提供的深空<em>灰色</em>之所以没有变深，原因之一似乎是深色的阳极氧化铝更容易留下指纹。例如，对于“午夜”M2 MacBook Air 来说，明显的指纹是一个常见的抱怨，因为它实际上相当暗。在上周<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctkW3V0Mh-k" title="苹果公司的“Scary Fast”活动主题演讲。">推出新的深空黑色选项时</a>，苹果特别提到了他们开发的一种新工艺，用于降低指纹的可见度。它<em>不是</em>涂层。相反，它是一种“突破性化学”，是阳极氧化过程的一部分。触摸起来感觉没有任何不同，而且似乎确实减轻了指纹的可见度。我称之为合法的突破。自从使用这台 MacBook Pro 以来，我从未清洁过它的表面，除了掌托区域上有一些眯着眼睛就能看到的污迹之外，没有太多使用过的迹象。</p><p>另外：MagSafe 电源线是黑色的，看起来很酷。如果达斯·维德用 MagSafe 为胸甲鳐鱼充电，这就是他的电缆。</p><h2>结论</h2><p>这些新款 14 英寸和 16 英寸 MacBook Pro 是有史以来最好的笔记本电脑。不仅仅是最好的 MacBook，最好的笔记本电脑，句号，而且我认为还差得远。他们看起来很棒，感觉也很棒。他们拥有世界上最好的键盘和最好的触控板。就其强大功能而言，它们非常轻薄。它们很耐用。他们提供了各种各样的端口，包括三个 Thunderbolt 4 端口（ <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Pro-14-M3,MacBook-Pro-14-M3x,MacBook-Pro-16-M3">但 14 英寸基本型号上只有两个</a>- 常规 M3 的那个）、HDMI 输出、SD 卡插槽和 MagSafe。甚至还有一个非常小的圆形端口，您可以在其中连接使用有线连接的耳机。这些显示屏是世界上所有笔记本电脑中最好的，具有出色的色彩准确性和卓越的亮度。对于笔记本电脑来说，扬声器系统听起来好得令人难以置信。</p><p>自 2021 年 10 月推出 M1 Pro 和 M1 Max MacBook Pro 以来，两年来一直如此。</p><p>现在它们甚至变得更好：M3 系列芯片不仅仅是 M2 的减速带。苹果为三个不同层次的用户设计了三种完全不同的芯片。它们的单核性能更快，多核性能更快，并且 GPU 引入了三项突破：硬件加速光线追踪和网格着色（Apple 芯片的新功能），以及他们称之为动态缓存的新内存分配技术（苹果公司声称，这是该行业的新手）。我怀疑这可以解释 Cinebench 的 GPU 基准测试中将 M3 Max 与我的非常相似的 2021 M1 Max 进行比较时的非凡增益。 Apple 的 M 系列芯片团队简直火力全开，完成了计算机架构设计和工程史上一些最令人印象深刻的工作。此类笔记本电脑的<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850863/asus-rog-strix-scar-17-review-qhd-gaming-laptop">重量超过 6.5 磅</a>，并且电池寿命很差； 16 英寸 MacBook Pro 的重量为 4.7-4.8，14 英寸 MacBook Pro 的重量仅为 3.4-3.6，并且所有型号的电池续航时间都非常长。苹果的芯片团队并没有在 2020 年取得突破性时刻，然后就一直回归平均水平——他们在每瓦性能方面继续<em>扩大</em>相对于行业其他公司的领先优势。 Mac 和 PC 笔记本电脑硬件之间的差异与 MacOS 和 Windows 软件之间的差异一样巨大和明显。也许更是如此。</p><p>那么你应该买一个吗？</p><p>任何今年早些时候购买了 M2 MacBook Pro 的人：我很同情你。第一轮酒由我来。</p><p>任何像我一样在两年前购买了 M1 MacBook Pro 的人：您都会受到诱惑。如果你一心想把钱包放在口袋里，再等一代再升级，请不要——我再说一遍，不要——让你的目光落在深黑色的 M3 MacBook Pro 上。</p><p>任何仍在使用基于英特尔的 MacBook Pro 的人：如果您还没有订购，请立即订购。当您体验这些优质苹果硅机器的使用方式时，我很嫉妒您所享受的待遇。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li

<p>Jess Weatherbed 为 The Verge 撰文，标题为“苹果说‘用 iPhone 拍摄’时的真正含义”：</p><blockquote><p>这是提升 iPhone 摄像头录制质量的好方法，但普通人不可能在家里重现这些结果，除非他们碰巧拥有一堆昂贵得离谱的设备。 “Scary Fast”幕后花絮中展示的装备对于大型工作室制作来说是相当标准的，但苹果公司通过这些所谓的“用 iPhone 拍摄”促销活动的含义是，只要购买最新的 iPhone，任何人都可以做到这一点。</p></blockquote><p>我也在 Mastodon 和<a href="https://www.threads.net/@blakersdozen/post/CzENNTQAD6G/">Threads</a>上看到一些人嘲笑苹果的做法。这是荒唐的。这些人是否认为以前的苹果主题电影都是由一名摄影师使用一台价值 4 万美元的红色电影摄影机拍摄的，没有工作人员、没有灯光、没有起重机？ iPhone“需要帮助”而传统电影摄影机不需要？我的意思是，你猜怎么着，他们也使用了专业麦克风。</p><p>苹果偶尔会指出，他们所有的软件——iOS、MacOS、Safari 和 Webkit、Final Cut、iWork 套件、照片和相机……所有这些——都是使用 Xcode、Swift、Objective-C 以及 AppKit、UIKit 和他们免费向所有开发人员提供 SwiftUI 框架。对苹果公司在主题演讲中使用昂贵的制作设备而撒尿，同时宣传他们使用 iPhone 相机拍摄的事实就像对苹果的开发者产品撒尿，因为单独的开发者或小团队无法创建整个操作系统或非线性专业视频编辑系统。</p><p>重点是，iPhone 15 Pro 相机非常出色，可以完美适合高预算的商业电影拍摄，并产生世界一流的效果。并不意味着普通用户只需按 iPhone 相机应用程序中的快门按钮即可获得这样的结果。这就是为什么苹果制作了一部完整的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast">幕后纪录片</a>！向我们展示如何才能让某件事看起来如此美好。</p><p>为何如此愤世嫉俗？苹果在这里取得的成就是非凡的。他们使用向世界各地数亿人出售的手机摄像头拍摄了一部 30 分钟的电影，镜头看起来非常好，以至于<em>没有人能看出它是用 iPhone 拍摄的，直到他们告诉我们这一点</em>。</p><p>这就是苹果最好的一面：他们为我们制造工具，自己也使用这些工具。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“淡化苹果 iPhone 速度‘快得吓人’的事实”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/downplaying-shot-on-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>脱口秀：“实际情况是什么” </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/31/ep-388" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v46" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/the-talk-show-388" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40326</id><published> 2023-11-01T00:58:49Z</published><updated> 2023-11-01T00:58:50Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Peter Coy, in a subscriber-only column for The New York Times (I&#39;m using a gift sharing link, which I hope works for all of you):</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. sells a lot of smart watches during the holidays, but this year its sales of most Apple Watch models may well drop 100 percent — to literally zero — the day after Christmas.</p><p> That&#39;s because of a <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files?file=secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1276_notice10262023sgl.pdf">ruling</a> Thursday by the International Trade Commission that most Apple Watches contain parts that infringe on patents held by Masimo Corp., a producer of medical technology, and its sister company, Cercacor Laboratories Inc., both of Irvine, Calif. An import ban and a cease-and-desist order on sales both take effect on Dec. 26 — unless President Biden reverses the decision by Dec. 25, which appears unlikely. (Presidents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">rarely</a> overrule the <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/">independent, nonpartisan agency</a> , which was <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub0000.pdf">founded</a> in 1916 as the US Tariff Commission.) [...]</p><p> Apple declined to provide an executive to speak on the record. The company&#39;s position is that Masimo is pursuing a strategy of litigation over innovation, hoping to generate a fresh stream of royalties because royalties from past litigation have dried up.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> On Monday, October 30, at Apple&#39;s Scary Fast special event unveiling the all-new MacBook Pro with the M3 family of chips and 24-inch iMac with M3, there was an unseen star of the show working behind the scenes. All of the presenters, locations, and drone footage in the event were filmed using iPhone 15 Pro Max, the preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers. Led by documentary film director Brian Oakes, known for the award-winning <em>Jim: The James Foley Story</em> and <em>Living with Lincoln</em> , Scary Fast put iPhone 15 Pro Max right in the middle of the action.</p></blockquote><p> I noticed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/shot-on-iphone.jpeg">the credit at the end of the video</a> last night: “This event was shot on iPhone and edited on Mac”, but until I saw that, I never would have guessed that the video was shot on iPhones. It looked every bit as good as Apple&#39;s previous pre-recorded keynotes, which presumably were shot on dedicated professional digital film cameras. To my eyes Apple didn&#39;t sacrifice an iota of image quality.</p><p> Even better, the behind-the-scenes documentary is fascinating. Given their cinematic quality, I&#39;ve always assumed these videos were major productions behind the scenes, but now we can <em>see</em> it — everything from lighting, directing, cinematography, sound, set design, talent, crew, editing, color grading — every single aspect of these keynotes aspires to the highest levels of production quality. Not merely “ <em>this looks and sounds good for a marketing video</em> ”, but “ <em>this looks and sounds good for a movie</em> ”.</p><p> It&#39;s impressive what the iPhone 15 Pro camera is capable of. And it&#39;s really fun that Apple finally took us behind the scenes of one of these keynotes.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Behind the Scenes at ‘Scary Fast’ — Shot With iPhone 15 Pro Max’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/best_leather_cases_for_iphone_15_pro" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v41" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40321</id><published> 2023-10-30T13:53:21Z</published><updated> 2023-10-31T19:44:29Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Two companies — Bullstrap and Ryan London — make high-quality leather iPhone cases with a cutout along the bottom lip. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Stephen Robles tested 11 leather cases for the iPhone 15 Pro, and <a href="https://youtu.be/6WNnw9Swhyc?si=ydQemaV8V6iubGZN">put together a nice video review</a> . If you&#39;re in the market for a leather iPhone case for your new iPhone 15, you should definitely watch his video.</p><p> For the last three or four years now, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll">I&#39;ve been buying</a> leather iPhone cases from <a href="https://bullstrap.co/products/magsafe-iphone-cases-sienna?variant=43515355300034">Bullstrap</a> . They&#39;re expensive — $89 — but they check every box for me:</p><ul><li> High-quality leather. Feels good, smells good, ages well.</li><li> A cut-out bottom lip. This design used to be common, but is getting harder and harder to find on <em>any</em> iPhone cases. I presume that&#39;s because people prefer cases with a lip that goes around the entire circumference of the front face of the phone, “for protection”, but the additional protection of covering the bottom lip seems negligible to me. I strongly prefer the way a no-bottom-lip case feels when swiping up from the bottom of the phone — an action I perform dozens of times a day. This design also solves <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+case+usb-c+cable+doesn't+fit">any problems</a> regarding USB-C or Thunderbolt cables fitting while your iPhone is encased.</li><li> Good buttons. Not great buttons, but good. This includes a button, not a cutout, for the Action button.</li><li> A unique (well, sort of — see below) “gentle hump” design around the camera cutout. I think this looks good, and it <em>feels</em> great. I don&#39;t like a sharp plastic ring around the camera cutout.</li></ul><p> Robles ranked the Bullstrap highly, but behind <a href="https://ryanlondon.com/collections/leather-iphone-cases/products/leather-iphone-15-pro-max-shell-case-magsafe-saddle-brown?variant=46641687822656">the case from Ryan London</a> . I don&#39;t know what the deal is between these two companies, but their cases are nearly identical. Same shape (no bottom lip), same buttons, same gentle hump around the camera cutout. I suspect both companies use the same manufacturer in China. Robles prefers the Ryan London because he prefers the way their leather both looks and feels. It definitely looks like a slightly different texture. Also, the Ryan London cases are a bit cheaper: $59 (with an optional $8 add-on to personalize your case with some embossed text).</p><p> <strong>Previously:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll">My reader poll from April</a> regarding case usage amongst DF readers. I posted <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/bullstrap-case-before-after.jpeg">this photo comparing a year-old Bullstrap case next to my then-brand-new one</a> for last year&#39;s iPhone 14.</p><p> <strong>Postscript</strong> : I actually like Apple&#39;s FineWoven cases. I spent a week vacationing in Florida with my iPhone 15 Pro in one. (I go caseless most of the time, but like using a case while traveling, when I&#39;m more likely to be taking a lot of pictures with my phone. An encased iPhone feels more like a camera to me, with better grippiness.) The dealbreaker for me is not the FineWoven material, which I actually kind of like. Rather, it&#39;s the bottom lip. If Apple&#39;s FineWoven cases had a cutout along the bottom, that would probably be the only case I&#39;d use.</p><p> <strong>Holy Crap Another Postscript:</strong> I, uh, just happened to run into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dan-seifert">Dan Seifert</a> from The Verge this morning, and wouldn&#39;t you know it, he had a brand-new Ryan London leather case on his iPhone 15 Pro. I had my Bullstrap with me, we compared, and we both agreed that the Ryan London leather looks just as good but has a slightly different — and better — feel. You can&#39;t go wrong with either of them — they really are remarkably similar cases overall, almost certainly made by the same Chinese manufacturer — but given that it&#39;s $30 cheaper, I suppose I&#39;d recommend the Ryan London. I actually like the Bullstrap embossed logo, though.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The Best Leather Cases for iPhone 15 Pro</title></entry><entry><title> &#39;Matthew Perry Was the Sarcastic Soul of “Friends”&#39; </title><link href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/matthew-perry-death-friends-chandler-bing-sarcasm-sitcom-1234865183/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v40" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40320</id><published> 2023-10-29T20:28:47Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T21:44:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alan Sepinwall, writing for Rolling Stone:</p><blockquote><p> There&#39;s not a lot of Matthew Perry in the pilot episode of <em>Friends</em> , but he gets to deliver one of its funniest jokes. As the gang sits around Central Perk, a newly-divorced Ross admits that he just wants to be married again. A second later, Rachel wanders into the coffee shop, soaking wet and wearing a wedding dress. Without missing a beat, Perry&#39;s Chandler Bing declares, “And I just want a million dollars!”</p><p> Like a lot of Chandler punchlines, it&#39;s quick and biting in its sarcasm. And like a lot of Chandler punchlines, Perry&#39;s delivery elevates it from a smartass quip that a few dozen actors could say into something you can&#39;t imagine leaving anyone else&#39;s mouth.</p><p> Note the timing and the emphasis of the thing. The pause after “And I,” the way he hits the “I” as hard as he does, and the way his voice goes full game show host as he says “million dollars,” all combine to give the gag a musicality beyond what <em>Friends</em> creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane wrote on the page. It&#39;s a small moment in an episode that is primarily concerned with characters who are not Chandler Bing. But you watch it and you want to hear him say things like it, again and again and again.</p></blockquote><p> Perry was so great on <em>Friends</em> , but my favorite show he was on was the short-lived <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/studio-60-on-the-sunset-strip/umc.cmc.2shyb7anow8v1rlv12c6lsx7v">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em> , a 2006 Aaron Sorkin show that I&#39;ve always thought failed in part <sup>*</sup> because it was a few years ahead of its time. Its lone 22-episode season aired on NBC. It was too smart, too cinematic, for network TV. It should have been on a cable channel like HBO, or, if it aired a decade later, a streaming service. The show was so good (at times — 22 episodes was way too many for a show striving for such quality), and Perry was sublime.</p><p> Perry, too, deserves accolades for his remarkable openness regarding his long struggle with addiction, and his heartfelt willingness to help anyone and everyone else with The Problem. Rest in peace.</p><p> <small>* I don&#39;t know if it hurt <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em> , but another weird thing about it was that it debuted the same year, on the same network, as Tina Fey&#39;s hall-of-fame-funny sitcom <em><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/30-rock/6240863759978157112">30 Rock</a></em> . Both shows shared the same fundamental premise: they were about fictionalized versions of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> . They even both had numbers in their titles, and those numbers were oddly similar. <em>Studio 60</em> was a funny drama, and <em>30 Rock</em> a sitcom&#39;s sitcom, but I always wondered if it was a bad idea to launch two <em>roman a clefs</em> about <em>SNL</em> at the same time.</small></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Matthew Perry Was the Sarcastic Soul of “Friends”’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-chandler-bing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3z" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40319</id><published> 2023-10-29T20:17:26Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T20:17:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alexis Soloski, writing for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> A confession: When I received a news alert that the actor Matthew Perry had died, my mind adopted the particular cadence that Perry perfected as Chandler Bing, the character he played for 10 seasons on the NBC sitcom <em>Friends</em> . Here is what I thought, “Could this <em>be</em> any sadder?”</p><p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html">Perry, 54, died</a> nearly a year after the publication of <em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething">Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a></em> , an unusually candid memoir of addiction and recovery. As he detailed in that book, he spent many of the best years of his career oblivious, avoidant, numb — conditions that don&#39;t typically encourage great acting. But he was great. And it had seemed reasonable, if rose-colored, to hope that sobriety might make him better, returning him to the nervy, instinctive brilliance of his peak years. That hope is now foreclosed. [...]</p><p> To say that he never did anything quite as good as <em>Friends</em> , before or after, is not to diminish his achievement. Even among the irrepressible talents of his co-stars, Perry stood out, for a rubbery, heedless way with physical comedy and a split-second timing that most stopwatches would envy. If you have seen more than a few episodes of the show — and many, many millions have, including fans born years after its initial airing — you will have absorbed Chandler&#39;s rhythms, his catchphrases, the way Perry&#39;s handsome, moony face would stretch like spandex, the better to sell a reaction. He had both an absolute commitment to what a line required and a way of gently ironizing that line. His character was the butt of jokes. Perry was in on those same jokes. There was a boyishness to him that seemed to excuse his characters&#39; worst behavior, on <em>Friends</em> and in subsequent roles.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Are There Ever Too Many Love Songs?&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/27/ep-387" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/the-talk-show-387" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40317</id><published> 2023-10-28T01:51:01Z</published><updated> 2023-10-28T01:51:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors on the new “use an emoji as a sticker reaction in Messages” feature in iOS 17.2, which just came out today as a public beta:</p><blockquote><p> Instead, to send a sticker response you have to tap and hold on a message and then choose Add Sticker from the resulting contextual menu, then choose a sticker or emoji. It&#39;s an extra step that really shouldn&#39;t be necessary and makes stickers feel like an afterthought, which they apparently are.</p><p> It gets worse. When you add a sticker reaction, it&#39;s placed on top of the message you&#39;re reacting to, obscuring part of the text! Why in the world would Apple choose a placement that makes it impossible to read the text being responded to? The right placement for these reactions is … wait for it … the same place that Tapbacks appear, in a little bubble snuggled up against the message that&#39;s being reacted to.</p></blockquote><p> This design feels more than a bit spiteful to me. I suspect there are two contingents inside Apple: the “ <em>Tapbacks are perfect just as they are</em> ” side (who prefer there are only six of them — heart, thumbs-up, thumbs-down, ha-ha, “!!”, and “?” — and who insist that they&#39;re monochrome), and the “ <em>Jesus H. Christ, every single other popular messaging platform in the world lets users react with any emoji they want, in full color</em> ” side. This new emoji-as-stickers feature is a small win for the latter contingent, but the Tapbacks-are-perfect side is calling the shots, and keeping Tapbacks as the only reactions that (a) are super-easy to apply, and (b) don&#39;t obscure the text of the message.</p><p> I&#39;ve been playing with the feature, and the one emoji I&#39;ve found that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/emoji-stickers-finger.jpeg">only <em>barely</em> obscures the text of the message</a> it&#39;s applied to just happens to be the perfect emoji to express my feelings about how this feature currently works: 🖕.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iOS 17.2 (Beta) Sticker Reactions Stink’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/ios-17-sticker-reactions-stink">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Google Spends $26 Billion Annually to Be the Default Search Engine Almost Everywhere (and Most of It Goes to You Know Who) </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934961/google-antitrust-trial-defaults-search-deal-26-3-billion" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40314</id><published> 2023-10-27T20:31:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T20:53:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>David Pierce, writing for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates"><em>US v. Google</em> antitrust trial</a> is about many things, but more than anything, it&#39;s about the power of defaults. Even if it&#39;s easy to switch browsers or platforms or search engines, the one that appears when you turn it on matters a lot. Google obviously agrees and has paid a staggering amount to make sure it is the default: testimony in the trial revealed that Google spent a total of $26.3 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones, and platforms. [...]</p><p> Just to put that $26.3 billion in context: Alphabet, Google&#39;s parent company, announced in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23929496/google-alphabet-q3-2023-earnings-ads-ai-sge">its recent earnings report</a> that Google Search ad business brought in about $44 billion over the last three months and about $165 billion in the last year. Its entire ad business — which also includes YouTube ads — made a bit under $90 billion in profit. This is all back-of-the-napkin math, but essentially, Google is giving up about 16 percent of its search revenue and about 29 percent of its profit to those distribution deals.</p><p> Most of that money, of course, goes to Apple. The New York Times recently reported that Google&#39;s deal to be the default search engine in Safari across Google products cost the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion">about $18 billion</a> in 2021.</p></blockquote><p> Goldman Sachs analysts have been estimating this number for years, and $18 billion in 2021 is pretty much in line with their estimates. (Goldman <em>conservatively</em> estimates about $17 billion in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traffic-acquisition-cost-tac.asp">TAC</a> payments from Google to Apple for this year, 2023. That would be the low end — Apple gets <em>at least</em> that much from Google for their partnership on this.)</p><p> Apple reports this revenue under Services, which has <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/">just grown past $20 billion per quarter</a> for Apple. So somewhere between 20-25 percent of Apple&#39;s Services revenue comes from these payments from Google alone. You can see why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google">Apple is rooting for Google</a> in this lawsuit.</p><p> This whole partnership with Google is the weakest link in Apple&#39;s overall privacy stance. Google generates so much money from search through user tracking that Apple would consider contrary to its own internal values. If Apple were to run its own search engine, it would be <em>far</em> more private than Google Search.

<p>Axios:</p><blockquote><p> New House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told Fox News&#39; Sean Hannity in his first interview as speaker that now is not the time to discuss legislation to address the scourge of mass shootings, adding: “The problem is the human heart, not guns.”</p></blockquote><p> Since no other civilized country on the planet has massacres like this, Johnson is implicitly arguing that the problem isn&#39;t the <em>human</em> heart, but the <em>American</em> heart.</p><p> Or, maybe the problem is the fact that America is the <em>only</em> country where military-grade assault rifles are not just legal, but legally obtainable by mentally ill angry men like this lunatic in Maine.</p><p> Either we are the worst people on the planet, or we have the worst gun laws.</p><blockquote><p> Why it matters: President Biden and Democrats in Congress are urging action in the wake of the shooting in Lewiston, Maine that left 18 people dead. Johnson argued that it was inappropriate to discuss gun control “in the middle of the crisis,” and that he believes, “it&#39;s not the weapon, it&#39;s the underlying problem.”</p></blockquote><p> This “ <em>now is not the time</em> ” argument gets trotted out by Republicans after each and every gun massacre. Right after their tweets offering “thoughts and prayers”. Bullshit. The aftermath of a massacre is <em>the</em> time to demand sane gun control measures. That&#39;s when the issue is clarified. Would Republicans argue that October 8 was “not the right time” for Israel to discuss Hamas terrorism? Was September 12, 2001 “not the right time” to discuss Al-Qaeda? Should FDR have delivered an address to the nation on December 8, 1941, advising that we relax, let cooler heads prevail, because the aftermath of Japan&#39;s attack on Pearl Harbor “was not the time” to consider retaliating?</p><p> Imagine a Venezuelan refugee illegally crosses the US-Mexico border next week and kills 18 US citizens with a bomb he carried across. Would Hannity have a guest on Fox News — say, Mike Johnson — arguing that “now is not the time, in the middle of the crisis, to talk about border security”?</p><p> Our emotional responses to these massacres are valid. Strike while the iron, and our blood, is running hot. Let our emotions fuel the urgency of our attempts to respond with <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/instant-intel/house-gun-legislation-background-checks-polling">overwhelmingly popular gun control legislation</a> , and let Republicans head into elections in two weeks opposing them.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Aftermath of a Massacre Is Always the Time to Push for Gun Legislation’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/aftermath">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CT Scans Reveal the Complexity of Apple&#39;s $129 Thunderbolt Cable </title><link href="https://twitter.com/jonbruner/status/1714696044356005949" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/apple-thunderbolt-cable" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40309</id><published> 2023-10-26T01:00:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T01:57:06Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">Joe Rossignol, MacRumors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced that it is increasing the prices of some of its subscription-based services, including Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+, for new and existing subscribers in the US and <a href="https://www.macg.co/services/2023/10/augmentation-imminente-des-abonnements-apple-arcade-apple-tv-et-apple-one-140063">many other countries around the world</a> .</p><p> The price changes in the US are as follows:</p><ul><li> Apple TV+: $6.99 per month → $9.99 per month</li><li> Apple Arcade: $4.99 per month → $6.99 per month</li><li> Apple News+: $9.99 per month → $12.99 per month</li></ul><p> For those who subscribe to Apple TV+ on an annual basis, the price has increased from $69 per year to $99 per year accordingly.</p><p> Prices for the Apple One bundles that include these services are also increasing as a result:</p><ul><li> Individual: $16.95 per month → $19.95 per month</li><li> Family: $22.95 per month → $25.95 per month</li><li> Premier: $32.95 per month → $37.95 per month</li></ul><p> [...] There are no price increases for Apple Music and Apple Fitness+ today.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d have linked to the Apple Newsroom announcement of these price increases, but there&#39;s not a word about them there. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple Newsroom</a> is sort of a “good news only” company blog.</p><p> At the Apple One bundle level, these increases are pretty modest, but at the standalone level, these hikes are notable. TV+ is now double the price <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">it debuted at just four years ago</a> .</p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1717188520123445666">Tom Warren, on Twitter/X</a> , makes a keen observation regarding the ever-escalating prices of streaming services:</p><blockquote><p> If Apple TV, Netflix, and Disney+ keep raising prices then it will only force more people into piracy. It&#39;s already surprising how many in the UK use modified Fire TV sticks to access pirated TV shows and movies.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ll quibble with his verb choice and suggest “push” not “force” — no one is <em>forced</em> to bootleg content — but the point stands. Ever since the iTunes Music Store opened 20 years ago, at the height of MP3 file sharing via Napster and similar platforms, I&#39;ve always thought of media bootlegging as a form of negotiation. It&#39;s like ad hoc collective bargaining between users and the corporations that set the prices and define the experience of consuming the media.</p><p> Subscription pricing requires a form of calculus to find the sweet spot that generates the most money. Set the price too low and you&#39;ll reduce piracy but leave money on the table. Set the price too high and you&#39;ll generate less money because more users — ones who might otherwise have subscribed at a lower price — will choose to bootleg. (Some people, of course, will always choose to bootleg. There&#39;s no point trying to find a price to appease them.)</p><p> But pricing isn&#39;t the only factor in this equation. The experience is too. Bootlegging&#39;s obvious appeal is the price: zero. But it&#39;s always been a bit of a pain in the ass. Weird apps and sketchy sources. Steve Jobs emphasized this aspect of the iTunes Music Store when he introduced it: 99 cents was an appealing price, but not as appealing as free. But the overall experience of searching for and downloading music from iTunes was so much better than bootlegging that it made you happy to pay for the songs.</p><p> Apple still gets that part: their apps for consuming their services are generally very low on annoyances. You almost never have to sign back in because your previous sign-in expired. So many of the streaming video services I use on my Apple TV make me jump through hoops with those incredibly annoying sign-back-in flows where you have to open a URL on the web using another device (probably your phone, if you&#39;re on your couch), and enter a code that&#39;s on the TV screen. Then you have to wait like 20 seconds and they let you back in. Then a few months from now you have to do it again for unexplained reasons.</p><p> Every time the official service makes you watch an unskippable ad, every time their shitty custom video player makes fast-forwarding or rewinding janky, every time their shitty app feels slow or forgets where you were in a movie that you paused days ago — those little annoyances add up, and they reduce the user experience advantage that paying for content should provide compared to bootlegging it.</p><p> If the “pirate or pay?” debate for users were just about price, zillions more people would bootleg their music and content and games. It&#39;s more like this:</p><ul><li><p> <strong>Pirate:</strong> Pay nothing (good), feel guilty about stealing the content (bad), go through all the hassle of obtaining pirated content and cracked copies of games and apps, and managing your own local library of content that&#39;s fallen off the back of these proverbial trucks (bad). Also, there&#39;s a risk of legal trouble, getting your internet service disabled, or just plain embarrassment if some piracy watchdog catches you (bad).</p></li><li><p> <strong>Pay:</strong> Cough up the monthly subscription fee for the service (bad), feel no guilt because you&#39;re not stealing anything (good), avoid the hassles of obtaining and managing bootlegged media content (good), and enjoy the ease of use of the official app for the service.</p></li></ul><p> I didn&#39;t put a “(good)” or “(bad)” after that last one, because it varies so wildly from one service to another. The only content I&#39;ve bootlegged in years are those rare films that aren&#39;t available through legitimate channels, like the wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition">“de-specialized” editions of the original Star Wars trilogy</a> . In addition to the fact that I have more money than sense, I&#39;m incredibly lazy when it comes to consuming entertainment. I don&#39;t want to work, at all, to find it, download it, or manage it. But some streaming apps are so bad they make it feel like as much work to watch their content legitimately as it would be to pirate it.</p><p> That&#39;s one thing that is vastly under-remarked-upon regarding Netflix: they&#39;ve always provided a terrific user experience. Their apps are fast, reliable, and well-designed. Netflix never forgets or expires my sign-in credentials. You can tell that everyone at Netflix, right up to Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings, <em>cares</em> about the entire user experience. Netflix, culturally, is much like Apple in that regard: they have good taste baked into the company DNA.</p><p> As for Apple&#39;s price hikes today, I&#39;m an Apple One Premier subscriber, and I&#39;m fine — not happy, of course, but fine — with paying an extra $5/month for everything I get. Of the three component services whose standalone prices went up, TV+ and Arcade seem justified. News+, however, does not.</p><p> I&#39;ve been saying for a few years that Apple TV+ is becoming the new HBO — a channel dedicated to prestigious original content, quality over quantity — and that feels more true than ever now that HBO is being <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/warner_max">watered down inside Max</a> . Apple TV+ is home to a steady stream of original shows that my family really enjoys. I&#39;m pretty sure we have more favorite shows on TV+ than any other service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">Unlike Netflix</a> , Apple sticks with all its good shows and renews them for multiple seasons, allowing them to end satisfyingly. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-25">1</a></sup> TV+&#39;s average content quality is way higher than that of Disney+, which has been cranking out <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CyHm6Ots64Q">embarrassing franchise-tanking turds</a> like <em>Ahsoka</em> and <em>Secret Invasion</em> , relative disappointments like <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> (a bloviating six-part series which should have been cut down to one solid two-hour movie), and only occasional gems like <em>Andor</em> . And while Apple TV+ has long stood out for its relative dearth of old library content, in terms of original new content, it has way more good stuff — for my taste at least — than Amazon Prime, Hulu, Max, or the also-rans like Peacock and Paramount+. I just don&#39;t care as much about streaming access to old library content compared to new original stuff, and I don&#39;t think most other people do either.</p><p> As for Apple Arcade — I personally don&#39;t play many video games, but more and more, the ones I <em>do</em> play on my iPhone are from Arcade. No ads, no in-app-purchase pay-to-win chicanery, and an ever-growing library of really good games that span a wide range of genres. $7/month feels more than fair.</p><p> But News+? The primary and obvious appeal of Apple News+ is getting access to paywalled content from <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/publications/">participating publications</a> like The Wall Street Journal. That&#39;s a long list of newspapers and magazines. But the actual reading experience often stinks — most articles from most publishers in Apple News are lousy with huge ugly ads, breaking up each article every few paragraphs. And the ads are often almost comically low-class <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/">chumbox</a> scams. I posted <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">screenshots of a few of them</a> just a few weeks ago on Mastodon. Just look at them. <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-25">2</a></sup> These ads — and the quantity of them — do not look or feel like something you should experience in a premium $10/month subscription — let alone the new price of $13/month. The only way this price increase for News+ can be justified is if Apple is planning to use the increased subscription fee revenue to both reduce the number of ads in articles <em>and</em> increase their quality.</p><p> As with bootlegging media and pirating games and apps, ad blocking is a negotiation between users and publishers. Reading the same article in a web browser, with extensions installed that block user-hostile ads, is, for me at least, almost always a far better experience than reading in Apple News. Given that News+ is a not-cheap paid subscription, that user-experience equation should be the other way around: it should be nicer to read in Apple News than on the web. But it&#39;s not. And yet Apple is raising the price.</p><p> Finally, I&#39;ll note with mild annoyance but absolutely zero surprise that while Apple is now steadily <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/apple-price-increase-apple-tv-plus-music-1235412633/#">raising prices for its media content services every year or so</a> , the data storage tiers for iCloud — whether free or paid — have remained <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9341083/apple-icloud-storage-plans-cheaper">unchanged since 2015</a> except at the highest tier. Eight years! Steady increases in media subscription pricing are annoying but understandable. Never increasing the amount of storage most users get with iCloud feels stubborn and spiteful.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-25"><p> I said <em>good</em> shows, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/business/media/jon-stewart-the-problem-ends.html">not all shows</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-25"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-10-25"><p> If you scroll through the replies to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">my post on Mastodon</a> , you&#39;ll see a few people suggesting that the reason I&#39;m getting served bottom-of-the-barrel chumbox ads like this is that I must have “Personalized Ads” turned off in Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Apple Advertising.

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> The new double tap gesture for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available today with watchOS 10.1, bringing a fast and convenient new way to interact with Apple Watch.</p><p> With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display.

This new feature complements existing gestures like tap, swipe, raise to wake, and cover to mute that make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been testing a Series 9 watch with beta software enabling double tap for the last month or so. It&#39;s a good feature, but it&#39;s not nearly as useful — yet? — as I was hoping. The one thing you have to get used to is that the watch only listens for the double tap gesture when the display is fully-on. You need to tilt your wrist to look at your watch before double tapping. Usually, that&#39;s natural — the reason you want to double tap to <em>do something</em> is because you see the thing you want do or dismiss.

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/spooktacular-apple-event-on-halloween-eve/">Dan Moren, Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Chalk this one up as something I&#39;ve never seen before: an Apple event in the <em>evening</em> . The company on Tuesday announced a “Scary Fast” event coming Monday, October 30 at 5pm Pacific time.</p><p> It&#39;s largely expected that this event will feature new Macs, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">reported by Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman this weekend</a> : the money seems to be on a refreshed 24-inch iMac, though other announcements are possible.</p></blockquote><p> Broadcasting an event at 8pm ET / 5pm PT is new, but we&#39;re still relatively early in the era of pre-recorded keynotes. Unusual to say the least — makes me wonder if there&#39;s some other shoe to drop that will make the timing make sense.</p><p> If it&#39;s the iMac, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the upgrade is to the M2, not the M3. Gurman reported that the iMac would skip the M2 and go straight to the M3, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-26/apple-aapl-plans-iphone-14-apple-watch-series-8-m2-macs-for-2022-and-2023-l4vd5unx">that report was all the way back in June <em>2022</em></a> :</p><blockquote><p> Outside of the Mac and iPad Pro, there&#39;s another place I expect the M2 to appear: Apple&#39;s mixed-reality headset. I&#39;m told the latest internal incarnations of the device run the base M2 chip along with 16 gigabytes of RAM. [...]</p><p> Apple is also already at work on the M2&#39;s successor, the M3, and the company is planning to use that chip as early as next year with updates to the 13-inch MacBook Air code-named J513, a 15-inch MacBook Air known as J515, a new iMac code-named J433 and possibly a 12-inch laptop that&#39;s still in early development.</p></blockquote><p> He was correct about the Vision Pro using the M2 — and remember, that was a full year ahead of it being announced — but it doesn&#39;t feel right to me that the M3 chip would debut in the iMac. Gurman has also pointed out that MacBook Pros — both the not-really-all-that-“pro” 13-inch model, and the truly-pro 14- and 16-inch models — are in short supply at the moment, with mid-November shipping dates for most configurations. But it just feels too early for the M3 Pro/Max chips to start shipping, when the A17 Pro — the chip the M3 is presumably based on — only started shipping last month. Given what I&#39;ve heard about TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability — particularly obtaining wafers — I think their hands are full just producing A17 Pro chips for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p><p> So I&#39;m just guessing here, but I&#39;m thinking this event might be about iMacs only, with an upgrade to the M2, and maybe some design changes — like, say, fresh colors. It&#39;d be a lot more fun if it&#39;s the debut of the M3, but my spidey sense says that&#39;s not happening yet.</p><p> <em>Also</em> : It would sort of feel awkward to start launching $1,300 M3-based iMacs (or $1,000 iPad Pros) months ahead of the $3,500 Vision Pro, which will have the M2. It feels natural to me that M3-based Macs and iPads will only launch <em>after</em> the Vision Pro, so that when the Vision Pro is announced, the M2 is still the “current” Apple silicon generation.</p><p> <em>But</em> : The event is named “Scary Fast”, so maybe it <em>is</em> about the debut of the M3 series? I still don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have the M3 Pro/Max chips ready, but maybe it&#39;s a refresh across the line for all the Macs that use the regular M2 (and in the iMac&#39;s case, M1)?</p><p> So it looks like Gurman is going to beat Ming-Chi Kuo in the “are new Macs coming this year?” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Thunderdome face-off</a> , but it&#39;s fun that no one seems to know what exactly is coming.</p><h2> Postscript</h2><p> OK here&#39;s a spitball idea that fits all the puzzle pieces together:</p><ul><li> Regular 24-inch iMacs get upgraded to the M2.</li><li> These new iMacs might also be the source for those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">purported color-matched braided USB-C cables</a> that were assumed to be for the iPhones 15. All iPhone 15 models ship with plain white braided cables, but the existing M1 iMacs shipped with fun color-matched Lightning cables.</li><li> New “pro” iMacs are launched, with the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, like the ones in the current 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros (which only debuted early this year). Maybe these hypothetical iMac Pros will have bigger displays too? 27 inches would match both the Studio Display and the old Intel-based “big” iMacs.</li></ul><p> M2 Pro and Max iMacs would justify “Scary Fast” in a way that just plain M2 iMac speed bumps would not. This would still allow the Vision Pro to launch “early next year” while the M2 remains the current Apple silicon generation. And this would fit with the scuttlebutt that TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability is, for the near future, almost entirely dedicated to keeping up with demand for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple to Broadcast &#39;Scary Fast&#39; Event Next Monday Night</title></entry><entry><title> The End of iTunes? </title><link href="https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/apple-is-finally-killing-off-itunes-for-real-this-time/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40305</id><published> 2023-10-24T18:33:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-26T00:42:42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Kirk McElhearn, writing at The Mac Security Blog:</p><blockquote><p> While some can cast aside the accumulated goodwill of a brand name on a whim, Apple doesn&#39;t like to do so. Even after splitting the iTunes app, Apple retained the iTunes Store name for selling digital content. You access the iTunes Store in the Music app on the Mac to buy music, and the iPhone and iPad still have iTunes Store apps. But there is some overlap: you can buy and rent movies, for example, in both the iTunes Store and TV apps, as Apple tries to shift purchases to the latter.</p><p> Soon, all that will be left of the iTunes brand is the iTunes Store for music. And people buy much less music [than] in the past, having mostly shifted to streaming. Will the iTunes name finally fade away as music sales dwindle? It&#39;s hard to imagine Apple stopping digital music sales entirely; even if fewer people buy digital music, the market isn&#39;t dead, not by a long shot. Global digital music sales peaked in 2012 at around $4.4 billion, and in 2021 they had dropped to $1.1 billion. That&#39;s a decline of about 75%, but Apple still earns a hefty amount of money from selling digital music.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been wondering about the same thing for a few years. I purchase/rent all my movies and TV shows on my Apple TV, where “iTunes” isn&#39;t mentioned. (And in the age of streaming, I really only purchase/rent movies — the TV shows I watch are all streamed nowadays.) So why keep the iTunes Store app around on iOS — they could just add a Store tab to the Music app. Buy your music — if you buy music — in Music, and buy your movies in TV.</p><p> The only reason I can think not to do this is that the Music app is already so jam-packed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The End of iTunes?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_and_ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3j" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40303</id><published> 2023-10-23T23:33:57Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T01:37:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Speaking of</a> Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">he has an interesting bit about Apple&#39;s AI efforts in his latest Power On column</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The company has some catching up to do. Apple largely sat on the sidelines when OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT took off like a rocket last year. It watched as Google and Microsoft Corp. rolled out generative AI versions of their search engines, which spit out convincingly human-like responses to users&#39; queries. Microsoft also updated its Windows apps with smarter assistants, and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled an AI-enhanced overhaul of Alexa.</p><p> All the while, the only noteworthy AI release from Apple was an improved auto-correct system in iOS 17.</p></blockquote><p> I would argue that the improved autocorrect in iOS 17 is a major feature — in my use it&#39;s clearly an improvement, and autocorrect is a feature used every day, in almost every app, by almost every iOS user. It&#39;s one of the most used and most important features in the entire OS. I&#39;d also argue that Apple has done some terrific work with AI features in Photos. The search feature in Photos works <em>really</em> well.</p><p> But I think Gurman&#39;s summary does get at an essential truth. If I asked you “Which companies are at the forefront of AI-powered products?”, I doubt you&#39;d put Apple on the list. And AI is proving so useful — and yet is a nascent field — that Apple needs to soon be on that list, lest their products begin to fall behind competitively. “Which companies are best at integrating AI into products?” is going to be like “Which companies are best at creating hardware at scale?” and “Which companies are best at human interface design?”</p><p> Gurman continues:</p><blockquote><p> Now, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook says that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years. But I can tell you in no uncertain terms that Apple executives were caught off guard by the industry&#39;s sudden AI fever and have been scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time.</p><p> “There&#39;s a lot of anxiety about this and it&#39;s considered a pretty big miss internally,” a person with knowledge of the matter told Power On.</p><p> As I first reported in July, the company built its own large language model called Ajax and rolled out an internal chatbot dubbed “Apple GPT” to test out the functionality. The critical next step is determining if the technology is up to snuff with the competition and how Apple will actually apply it to its products.</p></blockquote><p> What I have heard from little birdies in Cupertino is <em>not</em> that there was a miss on this already. Apple is almost never at the forefront of stuff like this. They&#39;re a deliberate company. Their goal, as with any new technology, is to integrate it into products in meaningful ways <em>best</em> , not <em>first</em> . That&#39;s why there&#39;s no internal anxiety that they&#39;ve already missed anything related to AI.</p><p> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver, but that the company — if only for privacy reasons — will only use what comes from its own AI/ML team.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple and AI</title></entry><entry><title> Kolide — Device Trust for Okta </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40304</id><published> 2023-10-23T23:30:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T23:39:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is chock-a-block with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: drafting emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk: malware, data governance, and prompt injection attacks.</p><p> Kolide is taking a two-part approach to governing AI use: allowing you to draft AI policies <em>as a team</em> , and using Kolide to block malicious tools. <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Rumor Pundit Thunderdome </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40302</id><published> 2023-10-23T19:16:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T19:16:54Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors on Friday:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</p><p> Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.</p><p> Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a> , ruling out an update to the all-in-one desktop computer this year. All other desktop Macs, including the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, were already updated in 2023 and are highly unlikely to be updated again until 2024 or later.</p></blockquote><p> But then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">here&#39;s Hartley Charlton on the latest from Mark Gurman</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple is planning a Mac-focused product launch, likely including the announcement of a refreshed 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> , for the end of this month, Bloomberg&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">Mark Gurman reports</a> .</p><p> In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">“Power On” newsletter</a> , Gurman said that Apple is “planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month” that could see the the release of a refreshed 24-inch iMac model, which is long overdue a hardware update. The current model launched in April 2021 and it is the only current-generation Mac left with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Gurman has repeatedly said that Apple&#39;s next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/">iMac will skip the M2</a> and feature the M3 chip instead, but he declined to mention which chip the new machine will feature in this newsletter.</p><p> Gurman noted that Apple retail stores are now in short supply of the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and many configurations now will not arrive until mid-November, in what he believes is “a clear sign that something is about to happen” regarding these three machines.</p></blockquote><p> Claim chowder tastes great with a side of popcorn.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Rumor Pundit Thunderdome’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> YouTube Music Is Now Available Natively on HomePods </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/youtube-music-integration-comes-to-homepod/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/homepod-youtube-music" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40301</id><published> 2023-10-23T18:46:17Z</published><updated> 2023-11-01T01:12:58Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick, MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> YouTube Music is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9231765?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;oco=1#zippy=%2Capple-homepod">now available</a> directly on Apple&#39;s HomePod and HomePod mini, thanks to new Siri integration support in the YouTube Music app. The change means subscribers to the streaming service can now choose to use voice commands to start YouTube Music on a HomePod, without having to append “on YouTube Music” to every request.</p></blockquote><p> Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s support document for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/use-siri-to-play-music-on-homepod-apd3399d3179/homepod">using Siri to play music on HomePods</a> , which includes the (pretty simple) directions for setting a default music service.</p><p> There&#39;s a big — and to me, a little weird — difference between music services and streaming video services. Every streaming video service is available on almost every device capable of playing video. Whatever box or built-in “smart TV” software you&#39;re using in your living room, it almost certainly has access to every major streaming video service. When Apple TV+ launched in 2019, Apple already supported Samsung TVs, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">pre-announced versions for Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony, and Vizio</a> .</p><p> But with these smart audio devices, it&#39;s been more drip-by-drip. It seems clear that each of the major smart audio device makers — Apple with HomePod, Amazon with Echo devices, and Google with their Nests — originally conceived of them as being companion products for the respective company&#39;s own music service, not open platforms. You can see how they&#39;d think that way: most people subscribe to multiple streaming video services, because each service has its own original shows and movies. But with music, most people subscribe to just one service, because each service pretty much has all popular music.</p><p> But in the long run it&#39;s better for everyone to do what&#39;s best for users, and clearly that means giving users a choice of which music service they want to use, no matter which hardware system they&#39;ve bought.

<p>Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica:</p><blockquote><p> An advertising industry group urged Comcast to stop its “10G” ads or modify them to state that 10G is an “aspirational” technology rather than something the company actually provides on its cable network today. The National Advertising Division (NAD), part of the advertising industry&#39;s self-regulatory system run by BBB National Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged by T-Mobile.</p><p> In its decision <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g">announced</a> Thursday, the NAD recommended that Comcast “discontinue its &#39;10G&#39; claims” or “modify its advertising to (a) make clear that it is implementing improvements that will enable it to achieve &#39;10G&#39; and that it is aspirational or (b) use &#39;10G&#39; in a manner that is not false or misleading, consistent with this decision.”</p><p> Comcast plans to appeal the decision, so it won&#39;t make any changes to marketing immediately. If Comcast loses the appeal and agrees to change its practices, it would affect more than just a few ads because Comcast now calls its entire broadband network “10G.”</p></blockquote><p> This is absolutely hilarious.

<p>Charlie Gile and Katherine Doyle, reporting for NBC News from Atlanta:</p><blockquote><p> Trump campaign legal adviser Kenneth Chesebro struck a deal with prosecutors from the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney&#39;s office in its 2020 election interference case on Friday.</p><p> Chesebro, who was charged alongside Donald Trump and more than a dozen other codefendants with attempting to delay the transfer of power after the 2020 election, was scheduled to stand trial this week. He accepted the offer as jury selection was underway on Friday, after 450 potential jurors had completed a lengthy questionnaire on what would be asked. He had rejected an earlier deal late last month.</p><p> Standing beside his attorney in court, Chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents and agreed to testify in the case as part of the deal.</p><p> The Trump attorney faces five years probation, a $5,000 fine, 100 hours of community service, and must continue to provide documents and evidence to the state, according to the terms of the deal.</p></blockquote><p> Yesterday crackpot Sidney “The Kraken” Powell <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/politics/sidney-powell-plea-takeaways/index.html">flipped</a> . Today, with Chesebro, they flipped a cooperating witness who isn&#39;t nuts. Prosecutors offer probation only when they&#39;re building a stronger case to send those higher up in the conspiracy to prison. If Rudy Giuliani has any sense he&#39;ll flip next.

<p>Joseph Simonson in The Washington Free Beacon, “NYU Law Students Say Classmate Losing Job Offer Over Pro-Hamas Statement Is &#39;Violence&#39;”:</p><blockquote><p> New York University law students are rallying behind a student who lost a spot at a white-shoe law firm for defending Hamas, saying the firm&#39;s decision to rescind their offer constitutes “violence.”</p><p> The Chicago-based Winston &amp; Strawn withdrew its offer of employment to Ryna Workman after the nonbinary NYU student issued a statement claiming “Israel bears full responsibility” for the terrorist attacks that have left more than 1,300 dead, including at least 30 Americans. The firm&#39;s decision is just one instance of “systemic, concentrated violence” Workman has experienced since issuing her anti-Israel pronouncement, according to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STpCTTPP2xLTyTJdFmHqxftF0jPb6jl30S_-ozqbdC4/edit">letter</a> of support obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.</p><p> The letter&#39;s signatories, which include the Black Allied Law Students Association and the Women of Color Collective, accuses NYU of being complicit “in the abuses of the Israeli government,” and condemns “the broader NYU administration for not protecting Ryna as a student and important member of our community.”</p></blockquote><p> Words have meaning. The far left has been mangling the definition of <em>violence</em> for years now, inverting the age old adage that sticks and stones can break your bones but words will never hurt you. Words can hurt, of course — deeply. But it&#39;s a different kind of hurt than pain and carnage inflicted through violence. We&#39;d be in a far better place if the only exchanges between Gaza and Israel were words, no matter how hateful those words be.</p><p> These students should be expelled from college, not placated. Misusing <em>violence</em> in this context — a terrorist attack that has killed 1,300 innocent Israelis, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-biden/card/latest-death-toll-in-israel-hamas-conflict-vGjRIHmG7vlGZUdBE5hn">maimed many thousands more</a> , and killed thousands of Palestinians in the resulting still-unfolding war — is outrageously offensive. Many of the dead can&#39;t be identified. They&#39;ve just been blown apart. That&#39;s violence. Everyone knows <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violence">what the word really means</a> — “the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy”. These left-wing nuts are obtusely pretending the word means something else for reasons that might surprise even Orwell, <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/">the master of identifying the decline of language in the name of politics</a> .

<p>I&#39;ve surfaced this 2013 gem from Forbes before, but it feels worth another link in light of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">that new Piper Sandler survey</a> pegging the iPhone&#39;s market share amongst US teens at a staggering 87 percent:</p><blockquote><p> Ultimately, in the eyes of today&#39;s youth, massive popularity has watered down Apple&#39;s coolness. “Teens are telling us Apple is done,” says Tina Wells of the youth marketing agency Buzz Marketing Group. “Apple has done a great job of embracing Gen X and older [Millennials], but I don&#39;t think they are connecting with Millennial kids. [They&#39;re] all about Surface tablets/laptops and Galaxy.”</p></blockquote><p> This take looks really goofy 10 years later, but at the time, there was a really strong, persistent media narrative that Apple couldn&#39;t thrive without Steve Jobs, and that Samsung in particular was going to surpass them. 2013 was the year of Phil Schiller&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple">Can&#39;t innovate any more, my ass</a> ” ad lib during the WWDC keynote.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Vintage 2013 Claim Chowder: ‘Is Apple’s iPhone No Longer Cool to Teens?’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/claim-chowder-iphone-cool">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Color Palettes From Dieter Rams Products for Braun </title><link href="https://www.presentandcorrect.com/blogs/blog/rams-palette" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/rams-palette" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40295</id><published> 2023-10-19T00:46:38Z</published><updated> 2023-10-19T00:46:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/apple-announces-new-apple-pencil-with-magnetic-storage-and-usb-c-port/">Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This pencil is clearly designed for use with the tenth-generation iPad: while it attaches magnetically to the long edge of the iPad for storage, it still charges via a physical port. Unlike the old Lightning model, which had a removable (and easily lost) cap hiding its charging and pairing connector, the new Apple Pencil features an innovative sliding design that reveals a USB-C port into which you can plug a cable (which, naturally, is <em>not</em> included). Its design is otherwise very similar to the second-generation Pencil.</p><p> At $79, this Pencil is cheaper than both the first-generation model at $99 and the second-generation model at $129. But that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t have all the features of <em>either</em> of them: it lacks the pressure sensitivity of either of the previous models, as well as the double-tap controls, wireless pairing and charging, and free engraving of the second-generation. However, the new Pencil <em>does</em> support the “hover” feature on M2 iPad Pro models.</p></blockquote><p> On the one hand, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUWA3AM/A/apple-pencil-usb-c">this new Pencil</a> makes complete sense. Lightning is quickly fading away, and this new slider seems like a much better design than the old cap. On the other hand, though, the fact that there are now <em>three</em> Apple Pencil models, all with different features and which are supported by different iPads, exemplifies just how over-complicated the iPad product lineup is.</p><p> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/the-price-of-apples-old-products-strategy/">Jason Snell hits that point in his own take</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Still, it&#39;s hard to look at the shenanigans in the iPad product line over the last few years and not get the sense that things are kind of a mess. This new Pencil should&#39;ve shipped last year with the 10th-generation iPad. The new iPad has features that higher-end models don&#39;t. There&#39;s insufficient differentiation between the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. (Leaving old models aside, it just feels like there are too many iPads, doesn&#39;t it?)</p><p> It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re witnessing a reset, however. There hasn&#39;t been a single new iPad announcement this year, and given Tuesday&#39;s Apple Pencil announcement, it sure feels like there won&#39;t be one. Perhaps 2024 will bring us a new wave of iPads that will finally make the product line make more sense. But don&#39;t get your hopes up too much: Apple will probably still keep selling some old models, too. It&#39;s what today&#39;s Apple does.</p></blockquote><p> Off the top of my head, what I&#39;d like from Apple on the iPad front next year:</p><ul><li> Drop the old 9th-gen iPad from the lineup. That iPad is so old it still has a home button.</li><li> Lower the price of the 10th-gen iPad by $100. (And maybe give it a speed bump from the A14 to A15 chip? But it&#39;s probably wishful thinking to hope for a price cut <em>and</em> a newer chip.)</li><li> Update the iPad Air (and Mini?) models to be more like today&#39;s iPad Pros, with Face ID instead of Touch ID. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-18"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-18">1</a></sup></li><li> Major revision of the iPad Pros, which haven&#39;t seen a major form factor change since 2018. Put more <em>pro</em> in the iPad Pros, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video">just like Apple has done</a> with the iPhone 15 Pro models.</li><li> Update the Magic Keyboard, ideally in a way that continues to support both iPad Airs and 11-inch iPad Pros. The Magic Keyboard is a great idea, and I think a popular one. But it ought to be better — thinner, lighter, and more durable. (The white ones especially age quickly. Keep your eyes out for them in the wild, in cafes and airports — they often look quite grungy. Compare and contrast with MacBooks, which often look great even after years of daily use.) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-magic-keyboard-aluminum-laptop/">Mark Gurman has reported</a> that just such a revision to the Magic Keyboard is in the works.</li></ul><p> That would clarify the iPad&#39;s three tiers: good (regular iPad, 10th-gen), better (iPad Air — the best choice for most people), and best (iPad Pros, with advanced new features and capabilities). The point should be to make the question “ <em>Which iPad should I buy?</em> ” as easy to answer as possible. I think Apple <em>has</em> made that question pretty easy to answer for iPhones, MacBooks, and Watches — and for peripherals like AirPods. <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-18"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-18">2</a></sup> Now do it for iPads.</p><p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol></p><p><li id="fn1-2023-10-18"><p> It feels like a very safe assumption that the issue here is cost: Face ID components are expensive, so the non-Pro iPads are saddled with Touch ID buttons instead. I&#39;m sure there are many happy iPad Air owners who aren&#39;t bothered by Touch ID. But if you&#39;ve ever used an iPad Pro with Face ID, it&#39;s impossible not to be annoyed when using an iPad Air. Face ID isn&#39;t just a different form of bio-authentication than Touch ID, it a clearly superior one. When I&#39;ve reviewed them, it&#39;s been a large focus of my attention. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_ipad_air">From my year-ago review of the current iPad Air</a> :</p><blockquote><p> For <em>me</em> , Face ID alone is worth $150. I use my iPad in a Magic Keyboard frequently, perhaps even a majority of the time. It&#39;s my kitchen computer. And I find using Touch ID on the power button somewhat awkward when the iPad Air is in the Magic Keyboard. But the Magic Keyboard is a $300 peripheral. It&#39;s not a niche product but it&#39;s certainly not for everyone. iPads are fundamentally handheld tablets, and handheld, the iPad Air&#39;s Touch ID instead of Face ID is much less of a difference. I still decidedly prefer Face ID, though. Touch ID on the iPad Air makes it feel easy to unlock. Face ID on the iPad Pro makes it seems like it wasn&#39;t even locked in the first place.</p></blockquote><p> With iPhones, Face ID is now in every model they sell but the SE. That&#39;s how it ought to be for iPads too: in every one of them but the price-focused entry model. It&#39;s too good of a feature, and a key advantage for iPads when compared to MacBooks. <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p><p></li></p><p><li id="fn2-2023-10-18"></p><p> The one weird MacBook is the 13-inch MacBook Pro. From a purely logical perspective, I don&#39;t think Apple should even sell that device. The M2 MacBook Air is cheaper, lighter, and equally capable. Study <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Air-M2,MacBookPro-13-M2,MacBook-Pro-14-M2">Apple&#39;s tech spec comparison page for 13/14-inch MacBooks</a> and it&#39;s hard to find a reason to recommend the 13-inch MacBook Pro. But I do think it sells surprisingly well. My theory is that there&#39;s a segment of the market that would be served better by the MacBook Air but who believe that they need a “Pro” MacBook. The specs don&#39;t matter to them — it&#39;s the name. Or maybe there are a surprising number of Touch Bar fans out there? <a href="#fnr2-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎</a></p><p></li></p><p></ol></div></p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ There&#39;s a New Apple Pencil With a USB-C Port, and My Thoughts Turn to the Complexity of the Overall iPad Lineup</title></entry><entry><title> Piper Sandler&#39;s Annual &#39;Taking Stock With Teens&#39; Survey </title><link href="https://www.pipersandler.com/teens" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v38" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40292</id><published> 2023-10-18T23:04:58Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T23:09:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Notable results from Piper Sandler&#39;s survey of over 9,000 US teenagers:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p> 70% of teens have used Spotify over the last six months (up from 68%), with 46% of teens opting to subscribe/pay for Spotify (up from 44%)</p></li><li><p> TikTok improved slightly as the favorite social platform (38% share) by 80 bps vs. spring &#39;23. SNAP was No. 2 with 28% share, followed by Instagram (23%)</p></li><li><p> Teens spend 28.7% of daily video consumption on Netflix (-220 bps vs. spring &#39;23) and 29.1% on YouTube (+100 bps vs. spring &#39;23)</p></li><li><p> 87% of teens own an iPhone; 88% expect an iPhone to be their next phone; 34% own an Apple Watch</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> The iPhone&#39;s market share among US teenagers has been remarkably high for as long as I can remember such surveys. Years ago, though, there was a split between how many teens actually <em>had</em> an iPhone vs. how many wanted one for their next phone. Now those numbers are effectively even. I suspect this is the primary driving force in the iPhone&#39;s continuing market share growth in the US It&#39;s easy to think only short-term and believe that just about everyone who might ever get a phone already has one, but there are teenagers (and pre-teens) getting their first phone <em>every</em> day.</p><p> That teens spend slightly more time every day watching video on YouTube than on Netflix isn&#39;t surprising, at least if you&#39;ve observed any teens recently. But it&#39;s rather remarkable given how different their business models are. Netflix spends a veritable fortune on new original content and old library content. YouTube content is mostly uploaded from users and content creators <em>for free</em> .</p><p> I&#39;d be curious to know if there&#39;s a noticeable split between which devices teens use to watch video on different services. Like, maybe YouTube viewing skews more toward watching on their iPhones, but Netflix on bigger-screen devices like laptops and iPads? TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram are surely viewed almost entirely on their iPhones.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Piper Sandler’s Annual ‘Taking Stock With Teens’ Survey’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Log Is the “Pro” in iPhone 15 Pro&#39; </title><link href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v37" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40291</id><published> 2023-10-18T22:40:45Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T22:40:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Stu Maschwitz, writing at Prolost:</p><blockquote><p> The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max</a> feature <a href="https://prolost.com/log">log</a> video recording.

<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> When a customer buys a new iPhone from an Apple retail store, the device sometimes comes with outdated software. For instance, the first iPhone 15 models out of the factory shipped with iOS 17, but iOS 17.0.1 was already available by the time the devices were available for purchase. Buying a new iPhone without the latest software isn&#39;t ideal, especially if there are some high-profile bugs. But that situation is about to change.</p><p> Apple is planning a new system for its retail stores that will update the software on iPhones prior to sale. The company has developed a proprietary pad-like device that the store can place boxes of iPhones on top of. That system can then wirelessly turn on the iPhone, update its software and then power it back down — all without the phone&#39;s packaging ever being opened. The company aims to begin rolling this out to its stores before the end of the year.</p></blockquote><p> Fascinating idea, but I have so many questions. What exactly is the trigger here? Something related to MagSafe? When the system is put into place, will it work with existing still-in-the-box iPhones or will it only work with <em>new</em> units, that ship from the factory running iOS 17.2 or whatever? Will the same system eventually come to other products, like iPads and Apple Watches? Maybe even Macs?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gurman: Apple Is Readying System to Apply Software Updates to Still-in-Box iPhones’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/gurman-inbox-software-update">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iMazing 3: Coming Soon </title><link href="https://imazing.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=imazing3beta&amp;coupon=FIREBALL-IMAZING3" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v35" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/15/imazing-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40289</id><published> 2023-10-15T23:23:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-15T23:23:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to iMazing for sponsoring last week at DF to promote iMazing 3, the world&#39;s favorite iPhone manager. Version 3.0 is nearing release — the biggest in their 15-year history. There&#39;s no other iPhone management utility like iMazing.</p><p> Rethought, rewritten, and redesigned from the ground up, Daring Fireball readers are invited to check out the MacOS beta of iMazing 3 today. Even better: DF readers can save 30% on any personal license for a limited time. All purchases are valid for the MacOS and Windows versions of iMazing 2 and iMazing 3, due out later this year.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iMazing 3: Coming Soon’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/15/imazing-3">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
