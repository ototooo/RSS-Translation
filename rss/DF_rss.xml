<p>几周前，当 Twitter 更名为 X 时，我们得知埃隆·马斯克以某种方式认为人们会同时使用“x”作为动词和名词，我记得曾经偶然发现过 1983 年<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/10/10/maven">晚期的</a>“论语言”专栏。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/10/10/maven">伟大的</a>威廉·萨菲尔：</p><blockquote><p> “联邦官僚机构发明了一个新动词，”纽约邱园的 Charles DeLaFuente 说道，他刚刚向国税局提交了 1040 所得税申报表。他附上了一个从美国国税局收到的写好地址的信封；在纳税人的纳税人的纳税人地址所属的左上角，是一个粗黑的方框轮廓。盒子旁边写着“如果退款，则 X 盒”。</p><p> “别介意这个悬而未决的问题，‘如果退还怎么办？’，”这位愤怒的纳税人说道。 “我们都知道，如果你收到退款，他们就会把盒子拆掉。也许他们在这些指示上节省的墨水将用于支付下一轮减税的费用。”</p><p>德拉富恩特先生——他的名字的意思是“喷泉的”——正在以错误的理由吹间歇泉。 x 这个动词并不新鲜。 1849 年，埃德加·爱伦·坡 (Edgar Allan Poe) 在他的一篇故事中写道：“‘我必须在段落之前解决这个问题，’他一边读一边对自己说。” 1935 年，乔纳斯·拜尔 (Jonas Bayer) 在《惊人侦探》杂志中将这个划掉的比喻带入了机械时代：“一个进口的打手用 0.45 口径的打字机可以消灭危险的金丝雀。”韦氏词典第一次引用单字母动词的字面意义来自 Henry Cassidy 1943 年的书《莫斯科日期线》：“我在第三个问题中去掉了‘西’这个词，将其改为‘东’。”</p></blockquote><p>整个专栏就像一座金矿，其中有一个关于费城口音的部分（Eagles =“Iggles”），还有一个部分提到了也许是有史以来最酷的美国人的名字，Pussyfoot Johnson。 （《纽约时报》订阅者可以阅读<a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1983/04/24/issue.html">《星期日》杂志原版的扫描件</a>。）</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“X 标记动词”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/11/x-marks-the-verb">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> David Rumfelt 的“著名 F40”矢量图</title><link href="https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2023/07/15/the-famous-f40-vector-illustration/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzq" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/11/famous-f40" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40166</id><published> 2023-08-11T21:20:31Z</published><updated> 2023-08-11T21:45:34Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Rachel Weiner 昨天为《华盛顿邮报》报道，“ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/09/twitter-fine-jan-6-trump/">Twitter 因未能移交特朗普数据而被罚款 35 万美元</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>正如一份报告所披露的，社交媒体公司 Twitter 被迫将前总统唐纳德·特朗普账户的记录移交给调查导致 2021 年 1 月 6 日袭击事件的特别检察官，并因未能更快地这样做而支付制裁费用。上诉法院周三公布裁决。 [...]</p><p> Twitter 的律师并不反对搜查令，但辩称，阻止该公司向特朗普发出搜查令的禁言令违反了第一修正案。该公司辩称，在该问题得到解决之前，它不应该交出记录。 2 月 7 日，豪厄尔站在政府一边，认为 Twitter 因未能遵守搜查令而被藐视法庭。她要求 Twitter 在下午 5 点之前提供记录，每天将受到 5 万美元的制裁，如果 Twitter 不遵守规定，制裁金额每天都会增加一倍。三天后，Twitter 公布了这些记录。</p></blockquote><p> 《华盛顿邮报》的报道重点关注 Twitter 的阻挠行为——考虑到这件事发生在今年，我认为这是由埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 推动的。但我对搜查令的目的非常感兴趣。这不是特朗普的推文，而是公开的。所以显而易见的结论是：他的直接信息。众所周知，特朗普 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/politics/donald-trump-computers-internet-email/index.html">不使用电子邮件</a>，而且<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/trump-texting.html">直到今年</a>，显然也没有使用短信。但他在 Twitter 上发送或接收过私信吗？他是否愚蠢到在其中放入任何有罪的东西？难道他就要被推特的未加密的恶果吊起来了吗？</p><p>从表面上看，不使用电子邮件或短信的人不太可能使用私信，但如果特别检察官没有寻找私信，我什至不确定搜查令的<em>目的是</em>什么。没有太多与非公开的 Twitter 帐户相关的内容。最不令人满意的答案可能是，特别检察官发布逮捕令<em>是为了防止</em>特朗普是 DM 用户，但他不是，而且那里什么也没有（或没有任何相关的内容）。但特别检察官让法庭相信特朗普的推特账户信息包含犯罪证据。 <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513.1208541751.0.pdf">来自未密封的上诉法院裁决</a>：</p><blockquote><p> 2023 年 1 月 17 日，政府申请并获得了搜查令，指示 Twitter 提供与“@realDonaldTrump”Twitter 帐户相关的数据和记录。与此同时，政府申请并获得了保密令，禁止 Twitter 向任何人披露搜查令的存在或内容。根据<em>单方面</em>宣誓书，地方法院认为有可能搜索 Twitter 帐户以寻找刑事犯罪证据。此外，地方法院认为，有“合理的理由相信”，向前总统特朗普披露逮捕令“将严重危及正在进行的调查”，因为这会给他“销毁证据、改变行为模式、[或]通知”的机会。同盟者。”该搜查令要求 Twitter 在 2023 年 1 月 27 日之前交出所有要求的信息。保密令在发布后 180 天内有效。</p></blockquote><p>这听起来不像是一次钓鱼探险。</p><p>众所周知，Twitter 私信<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">未加密</a>。使用 iMessage、Signal 和 WhatsApp 等 E2EE 消息传递平台，消息不会神奇地受到搜查令的保护，但此类消息只能从参与者自己的设备中生成，或者根据平台的不同， <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/reuters_report_on_apple_dropping_plan_for_encrypted_icloud_backups">从这些设备的备份中</a>生成。但对于未加密的 Twitter DM，消息只是存放在 Twitter 的服务器上。我们还<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/twitter-bug-deleted-tweets">从几个月前的这个故事中</a>知道，“已删除”的推文只是被隐藏，而不是真正删除——并且一个错误导致已删除的推文重新出现。对于“已删除”的直接消息来说，这也是（或者仍然是）吗？我认为 Twitter 上发送的每条私信很可能仍然存在。</p><p>说到推特漏洞，未密封的法庭裁决中的这段话让我笑了：</p><blockquote><p>政府首次尝试向 Twitter 提供搜查令和保密令时遇到了困难。 2023 年 1 月 17 日，政府试图通过 Twitter 网站提交文件以寻求法律请求，却发现该网站无法运行。两天后，即 2023 年 1 月 19 日，政府成功通过该网站为 Twitter 提供服务。</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 特朗普使用 Twitter 私信吗？ （请回答“是”。）</title></entry><entry><title> Gizmodo 主编 Dan Ackerman 起诉苹果公司，指控《俄罗斯方块》电影抄袭了他的书</title><link href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/apples-tetris-movie-ripped-off-tech-writers-book-lawsuit-says-2023-08-08/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzm" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/10/ackerman-apple-tetris-lawsuit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40162</id><published> 2023-08-10T19:29:20Z</published><updated> 2023-08-10T19:56:38Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>在研究上<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad">一篇文章</a>的过程中，当时的《纽约时报》餐厅评论家咪咪·喜来登 (Mimi Sheraton) 于 1976 年陪桑德斯上校去曼哈顿的一家肯德基，我了解到她几个月前去世，享年 97 岁。这确实是一个开创性的职业生涯：</p><blockquote><p>喜来登女士是一位冒险家，热衷于另类体验，对食物有着不拘一格的品味，并且能够独立地抵抗餐馆老板和广告商的压力，她是第一位为《泰晤士报》评论餐厅的女性。她开创了乔装点评、戴着假发和有色眼镜就餐以及使用化名进行预订的先河，主要是在高端场所，否则人们会通过重复访问而认识她并对她倾注大量注意力。</p><p>她在 2004 年的回忆录《吃我的话：一生的胃口》中写道：“我对餐馆进行评论的时间越长，我就越相信，这位不知名的顾客与一位尊贵的顾客或一位公认的美食评论家相比，有着完全不同的体验。” ” “出于所有实际目的，他们还不如在不同的餐厅。”</p></blockquote><p>以我对餐饮业的了解，很难相信评论是<em>不</em>经过伪装的。常客（和公认的评论家）得到更好的服务和食物是再明显不过的了，这就是为什么<a href="https://kottke.org/13/09/on-the-regular">找到你最喜欢的地方并成为这些地方的常客是如此令人高兴</a>。</p><blockquote><p>同事和其他餐厅评论家形容她的评论严厉但公平，并且经过严格研究。 《纽约时报》要求在发表评论之前访问一家餐厅三次；她吃了六到八次才做出判断。在一篇有关熟食三明治的文章中，她在一天内收集了 104 个咸牛肉和熏牛肉样本，以评估肉类和三明治的制作技术。 [...]</p><p>她的另一篇评论基于几位《纽约时报》工作人员的盲品，她更喜欢自有品牌酒，而不是苏格兰威士忌、波本威士忌、黑麦、伏特加和杜松子酒等流行品牌。这篇评论是在圣诞节前几周进行的，圣诞节是酒类销售旺季。</p><p> “我听说价值 200 万美元的广告被取消了，”喜来登女士在她的回忆录中回忆道。她找到了执行主编。 “我问阿贝·罗森塔尔这是否属实。他说：‘这不关你的事。这是一个很棒的故事。”</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接“纪念纽约时报美食评论家咪咪·喜来登”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/remembering-mimi-sheraton">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “对于上校来说，这真是令人舔手指” </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzh" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40157</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:40:55Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T20:17:00Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MrBeast 对 MrBeast Burgers 的质量不满意让我想起了肯德基的创始人哈兰·桑德斯上校，他于 1964 年将公司卖给了一家企业集团，然后在余生中一直担任肯德基的付费代言人，尽管事实上他他鄙视他们的食物，并对卖掉连锁店表示深深的遗憾。 1976 年，《纽约时报》餐厅评论家咪咪·喜来登 (Mimi Sheraton) 陪着当时 86 岁的桑德斯去了曼哈顿市中心的一家肯德基：</p><blockquote><p>进入厨房后，上校走到一个装满炸鸡块的大桶前，宣布：“那太黑了。它应该是金棕色的。你要煎 12 分钟——这太长了 6 分钟。更重要的是，你的煎炸油应该在一周前就换掉。这是我见过的最难吃的炸鸡。让我看看你的肉汁土豆泥，你是怎么做的？”</p><p>当辛格尔顿先生解释说他首先将沸水混合到速溶土豆粉中时，上校打断了他。 “然后你就可以粘贴壁纸了，”他说。 “接下来假设你添加一些棕色肉汁，然后你就会得到污泥。” “没有人能让我吞下这些土豆，”他尝了一些后说道。 “还有这个凉拌卷心菜沙拉。这个凉拌卷心菜！他们就是不听我的。应该是切碎的，而不是切碎的，而且应该是用奇迹鞭制作的。其他任何东西都会变成灰色。除了卷心菜之外，里面应该什么也没有。没有胡萝卜！”</p><p>辛格尔顿先生回答说：“我只是按照吩咐去做，先生。”桑德斯上校随后温和地对目瞪口呆的经理说：“好吧，这不是你的错。你只是在为一家不知道自己在做什么的公司工作。”</p></blockquote><p>桑德斯当时代表该连锁店拍摄广告的年薪为 20 万美元。但他们要做什么——解雇他？我想知道今天有多少孩子意识到桑德斯是一个真正的人，他实际上创立了这家连锁店，而不是像麦当劳叔叔或伟大的披萨鉴赏家查尔斯娱乐奶酪那样虚构的吉祥物？</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“对于上校来说，这太糟糕了”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> MrBeast 被其虚拟汉堡连锁餐厅背后的公司起诉索赔 1 亿美元</title><link href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/mr-beast-sued-burger-company-100-million-1235689127/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzg" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/mrbeast-burger-suit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40156</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:05:58Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T18:26:37Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Casey Liss:</p><blockquote><p> When I watch a movie or TV show, I&#39;m <em>constantly</em> trying to figure out who that actor is, who the director is, and so on. Early this year, I wanted a way to look this up that was native to iOS/iPadOS, but also fast, with no fluff that I wasn&#39;t interested in. I wanted a bespoke version of the IMDB app.</p><p> So I wrote it. It&#39;s called Callsheet, and I&#39;d love for you to try it. Callsheet is a subscription-based app, but all subscription plans have a one-week free trial. Additionally, your first twenty searches are free, before you&#39;re compelled to subscribe.</p></blockquote><p> A few years ago I switched from IMDB to The Movie Database (TMDB) for my movie/TV lookups. IMDB, once great, is now laden with obtrusive ads to an extent that is user-hostile. But I&#39;d been vaguely wishing that there were a top-notch native iPhone TMDB app. Callsheet is that app. I&#39;ve been beta-testing it for months, and ever since, Callsheet has been one of the few apps I use almost daily.

<p>My thanks to Warp for sponsoring last week at DF. Warp is a blazingly fast, Rust-based terminal reimagined from the ground up to work like a modern app. A lot of “modern” terminal apps just offer ways to make your windows look cool — colors, transparency, stuff like that. Warp offers all of that in spades — it&#39;s a very cool-looking terminal. But Warp is highly innovative in <em>functional</em> ways too. Even if you don&#39;t care at all how your terminal looks, Warp is definitely worth checking out.</p><p> Warp lets you edit your commands like in an IDE, with selections, auto-suggestions, and completion menus. Generate commands from natural language using AI so you don&#39;t have to context switch to Google (or whatever your preferred search engine is) anymore. Navigate through your terminal output command-by-command instead of scrolling through a wall of text.</p><p> And with the newly released Warp Drive, there&#39;s a secure place to save your commands as workflows so you can annotate, share, and execute them on-demand.</p><p> Warp works with bash, zsh, and fish (my favorite shell) and requires zero config.

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/meta-threads-engagement-has-dropped-off-sensor-tower-similarweb.html">Hayden Field, reporting for CNBC last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Last week, the text-based social media platform reported a record 100 million sign-ups in just five days, but according to data from Sensor Tower and Similarweb, the service has seen some dropoff in growth and engagement.</p><p> “The Threads launch really did &#39;break the internet,&#39; or at least the Sensor Tower models,” Anthony Bartolacci, managing director at Sensor Tower, a marketing intelligence firm, told CNBC. “In the 10-plus years Sensor Tower has been estimating app installs, the first 72 hours of Threads was truly in a class by itself.”</p><p> But, he added, Sensor Tower data suggests a significant pullback in user engagement since Threads&#39; launch: On Tuesday and Wednesday, the platform&#39;s number of daily active users were down about 20% from Saturday, and the time spent for user was down 50%, from 20 minutes to 10 minutes.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/nobody_uses_threads_anymore" title="Nobody Uses Threads Anymore, It's Too Crowded">I wrote earlier this week</a> about the onslaught of “ <em>turns out Threads is a bust</em> ” news stories following in the wake of “ <em>Threads launches as a sensational hit</em> ” stories. One thing that&#39;s struck me while following this is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=threads+sensor+tower&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news">just how many of these stories cite Sensor Tower data</a> . But how much should we take Sensor Tower&#39;s usage data at face value? Sensor Tower can only estimate these numbers, it can&#39;t <em>know</em> them. They aren&#39;t Apple or Google (the owners of the app stores through which Threads remains exclusively distributed, and mobile OSes that report back analytics data from all users who opt-in), nor do they have any access to Meta&#39;s own copious data.</p><p> Here&#39;s what Sensor Tower claims about their data collection, under “ <a href="https://sensortower.com/responsibly-sourced-data" title="Sensor Tower: Responsibly Sourced Data">Where our data comes from</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Our data scientists and algorithms process and enrich trillions of aggregated data points contributed to us from millions of devices, to cultivate our one-of-a-kind data estate. They get this data from a statistical panel of consumers we have built to continuously learn from millions of people around the world. Our panelists provide us data as they use our popular privacy-compliant mobile apps. We employ best practices to ensure that our panelists understand what data they are providing us in exchange for the use of our apps.</p><p> The team in our app studio publishes apps in several categories:</p><ul><li><p> Wellbeing [ <em>sic</em> ] apps aid in improving our users&#39; quality of life, such as ActionDash and StayFree</p></li><li><p> Games provide entertainment and escape for users, such as Melodies Run [ <em>sic</em> , sort of <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-05">1</a></sup> ]</p></li><li><p> Advanced apps and browser plugins provide convenience, such as Friendly Streaming, Friendly Retail, Stayfocusd and Adblock Luna</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> So Sensor Tower&#39;s information comes from analytics it collects from its own apps. They name these apps, but don&#39;t link to them, so I will:</p><ul><li><p> ActionDash — <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actiondash.playstore">Exclusive to Android</a> , ActionDash is described as a “screen time helper” that is “trusted globally by over 1 million users to break their phone addiction”. The developer is listed as “ActionDash”, not Sensor Tower, but the <a href="https://actiondash.com">app&#39;s website</a> says “Copyright © 2020 Sensor Tower, Inc” in the footer. As a screen-time monitor, you can see how this app would, by definition, provide Sensor Tower with information about everything a user does on their phone.</p></li><li><p> StayFree — Another “screen time tracker”, available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burockgames.timeclocker">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stayfree-web-stay-focused/id1631132311">iOS</a> . The Android description:</p><blockquote><p> StayFree - Screen Time &amp; Limit App Usage is a self control, productivity and phone addiction controller app that allows you to show how much time you spend on your smartphone and helps you focus by restricting the usage of apps. You can set usage limits for your apps and receive alerts when exceeding those usage limits.</p></blockquote><p> The iOS description:</p><blockquote><p> StayFree - Web Analytics &amp; Screen Time Tracker is an analytics, self control, productivity, and web addiction controller extension. This app works with the Safari web browser on your iOS device. StayFree provides analytics to help you understand how you are using the internet (daily website usage statistics) and focus your time by restricting the usage of distracting websites.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a very different description. But the latest iOS release, version 2.2, claims:</p><blockquote><p> We are introducing usage monitoring for applications in addition to websites! This marks the first stage of the feature, which is currently in beta. Although it may initially be somewhat sluggish and prone to errors, we anticipate ongoing improvements in future updates.</p></blockquote><p> StayFree observes your Safari usage through an extension that prompts for permission to observe every single website you visit. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/08/stayfree-safari-permission-confirmation.jpeg">Here&#39;s the alert I OK&#39;d to permit this</a> . It monitors your app usage by asking for access to your Screen Time. I installed StayFree last week and, in the name of science, granted it access to both my web browsing and Screen Time. (I plan to delete it as soon as I publish this story.) I have found it to be exactly as described: very slow and prone to errors. What it does report can be viewed faster and with a better presentation in the Screen Time section of Settings. The StayFree Safari extension keeps many web pages from even loading for me.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://melodiesrun.apppage.net/">Melody Run</a> — An infinite runner game, where you slide the hero left/right to hit squares, and each square you hit plays the note from a song. You score gems that can be cashed in to unlock new songs, and you can collect hundreds of gems at a time by watching video ads, which seem to all be for other games. It strikes me as neither fun nor challenging but it is a real game, and there&#39;s apparently a level editor you can unlock if you play more than I was willing to. The game seems identical on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/melodies-run/id1599540626">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativetechnology.melodies3d&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us">Android</a> , but only the iOS app asks whether you agree to let the game track you while using other apps. Even with tracking permitted, though, I fail to see how this game is able to collect the sort of detailed usage data Sensor Tower reports, except for your usage of other apps that embed the same tracking frameworks. There&#39;s no way, for example, that playing Melody Run would allow Sensor Tower to gain any information about Threads. Not how long you use it, not how often you launch it, not even whether you have it installed. That&#39;s the whole point of <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/security-of-runtime-process-sec15bfe098e/web">sandboxing</a> .</p></li><li><p> Friendly — Sensor Tower mentions apps named Friendly Streaming and Friendly Retail. I can&#39;t find any apps with those exact names, but I believe they&#39;re referring to a small suite of apps from <a href="https://friendly.io">a company called Friendly</a> , which publishes apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id400169658?pt=2051617&amp;ct=friendly.io&amp;mt=8">iOS</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/friendly-streaming/id553245401?mt=12">MacOS</a> , and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7399185471421849469">Android</a> . <a href="https://friendly.io/insights/privacy/">Friendly&#39;s privacy policy</a> declares that they&#39;re “an affiliate of Sensor Tower Inc.” Friendly Social Browser is a web browser with built-in bookmarks for sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Friendly Streaming Browser is a Mac app that&#39;s just a web browser with built-in bookmarks for YouTube and major streaming sites. (Somehow Friendly Streaming Browser was deemed by Apple worthy of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1655204439">this App Store feature story</a> .) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-shopping-browser/id6443906359">Friendly Shopping Browser</a> is, you guessed it, a web browser with built-in bookmarks for shopping sites like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-shopping-insights/id6444090373">Friendly Shopping Insights</a> is an app dedicated to Amazon — you log in with your Amazon credentials and it shows you your spending history and habits. Basically it&#39;s an app that, I think, lets Sensor Tower see everything you buy or look at in Amazon, along with your purchase history. I say “I think” because I didn&#39;t actually log into my Amazon account after installing it. Why anyone would ever use any of these apps I have no idea.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.stayfocusd.com/">StayFocused</a> — “a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend on time-wasting websites.”</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://adblockluna.com/">Adblock Luna</a> — Adblock Luna is a VPN promoted specifically for ad blocking. When a VPN is installed and active, all network traffic is tunneled through the VPN. Your VPN provider can see (and thus track) <em>everything</em> you do on the internet, whether it&#39;s through a browser (including private/incognito tabs) or an app. Sensor Tower claims “more than 15 million users have already installed Luna”. These users are an incredibly rich source of information for Sensor Tower.</p><p> Adblock Luna <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensortower.luna">is in Google&#39;s Play Store</a> , but when you tap the “Install for Android” button on the Luna website, instead of linking to the Play Store, they instead <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/08/adblock-luna-android-install.png">show this popover</a> instructing you to (1) enable the Android setting to allow apps to be installed from unknown sources (aka sideloading); then (2) install the .apk app bundle that was just downloaded to your device. I don&#39;t know why they steer users to sideloading rather than the version of Adblock Luna in the Play Store, but to me that&#39;s a red flag.</p><p> Adblock Luna is not in Apple&#39;s App Store. For iOS devices, they direct you to <a href="https://adblockluna.com/install">this page</a> . First, they require you type the year you were born to “prove” you&#39;re over 18. Then you download a VPN profile and they walk you through the steps in Settings to enable their root trust certificate. It&#39;s obvious why this isn&#39;t in the App Store. This is about as close as you can get to installing third-party system software on iOS.</p></li></ul><hr /><p> So, I see three ways Sensor Tower collects usage information for apps and websites that aren&#39;t their own: (1) ad-blocking web browser extensions, (2) screen-time monitoring apps for Android and iOS, which on iOS requires access to Screen Time, and (3) the Adblock Luna VPN. (Perhaps I&#39;m underestimating how much data they can collect from users who play Melody Run.)</p><p> These apps may well be popular — again, they claim that Adblock Luna has been installed by over 15 million users — but is the data they collect from them representative of the general public? ActionDash and StayFree are advertised for people who are looking to “break their phone addiction”. Data collected from these apps might be accurate for those users, but are users who self-identify as having an “addiction” to their devices representative of typical users? This seems a bit like trying to glean beverage consumption statistics by polling self-professed alcoholics — neither those actively struggling with an addiction nor those who are successfully managing one strike me as likely to be representative of the general public.</p><p> The user base for these apps must be comprised largely of technically naive, uninformed users. (Also: cheapskates, given that Sensor Tower&#39;s tools are free of charge. Quite literally, their users are their product.) Both iOS and Android have built-in screen-time monitoring features, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982">Screen Time</a> on iOS, <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en">Digital Wellbeing</a> on Android. Both allow you to track usage and set limits. If there&#39;s a single advantage to installing ActionDash or StayFree instead of using the built-in system features, I don&#39;t know what it is. Ad blocking, of course, is very popular, but using a VPN for ad blocking, instead of a web browser extension, is like using a chainsaw to remove the kernels from a cob of corn — not just overkill but dangerous. There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s not in the iOS App Store, and why Sensor Tower steers Android users to a self-hosted version that&#39;s not in the Play Store.</p><p> The vast majority of the public would never even think to install a third-party screen-time monitor. And by most estimates, only <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+percentage+of+people+use+ad+blockers">40 percent of people use ad blockers</a> . Anyone looking for screen-time monitoring and controls should use the built-in features on their device. I find it hard to believe that anyone who truly understands the nature of a VPN, when looking for an ad-blocking tool, would choose to use a free VPN from a data analytics company. But those are the people whose internet usage Sensor Tower tracks, and thus the people whom the mainstream news media blindly cites, by way of Sensor Tower&#39;s pronouncements, <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-05">2</a></sup> as representative of the world at large.</p><p> The installation instructions for Adblock Luna are surely scary to non-technical laypeople, and they&#39;re downright terrifying to anyone expert enough to understand how VPNs works. So who is left? The ignorant but brazen. Perhaps such people&#39;s web and app usage really is representative of the public at large. But there&#39;s no way to know. We can judge the accuracy of, say, political pollsters by comparing their data to the actual results of elections. There&#39;s no such reckoning for the usage data published by Sensor Tower and their ilk. It&#39;s all unverifiable, but never reported as such. The news media so badly wants to know usage data that they just accept Sensor Tower and other such firms&#39; pronouncements at face value, without ever describing — let alone questioning — how they ostensibly know what they claim to know about very private data. <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-05">3</a></sup></p><p> Color me dubious.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-05"><p> There&#39;s a 2-star review in the Play Store that starts, “I rated 2 cause of this: you changed your name to melody run when its supposed to be melodies run. I can&#39;t get to the level editor!” So I guess that explains why Sensor Tower&#39;s website claims the game&#39;s name is “Melodies Run” — that actually <a href="https://melodiesrun.apppage.net/">used to be the name</a> . And at least one user is upset about the name changing to Melody Run. <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-05"><p> There are other companies in the same racket as Sensor Tower. The next-most-frequently cited, at least in my reading, is Similarweb. <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/corp/ourdata/">Similarweb&#39;s own description of how they source their data</a> is far more opaque than Sensor Tower&#39;s, and thus strikes me as even more dubious. <a href="#fnr2-2023-08-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-08-05"><p> Here&#39;s a thought exercise. Imagine if Apple and Google issued weekly reports revealing how many people used, say, the most popular 1,000 apps in their respective App Stores, along with how much time, on average, they spent using them. That would be data that could fairly be assumed to be accurate. But would not the major news media — publications such as The New York Times, that generally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=big+tech">report on “Big Tech” in an unflattering light</a> — object to such reporting as a violation of users&#39; collective privacy? As further proof that these companies know too much about us? But yet they echo the same information, when reported by Sensor Tower and Similarweb, without batting an eye or ever raising a question as to how this very private data is collected. <a href="#fnr3-2023-08-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ What&#39;s the Deal With Sensor Tower?</title></entry><entry><title> Android Spyware Maker LetMeSpy Shuts Down After Hacker Deletes Server Data </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/letmespy-spyware-shuts-down-wiped-server/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz9" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/05/letmespy" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40149</id><published> 2023-08-05T19:52:12Z</published><updated> 2023-08-05T19:52:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Zack Whittaker, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> Poland-based spyware LetMeSpy is no longer operational and said it will shut down after a June data breach wiped out its servers, including its huge trove of data stolen from thousands of victims&#39; phones.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686828350289887232">Elon Musk, on Twitter/X</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting. People from every corner of the world post incredible content on X, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred dollars a month changes their life.</p><p> While we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%. First 12 months is still free for all.</p><p> Apple does take 30%, but I will speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook">@tim_cook</a> and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30% of what X keeps in order to maximize what creators receive.</p></blockquote><p> A couple of thoughts on this. First, it strikes me as exceedingly unlikely that Apple is going to carve out any sort of exception for X Corp. And even if Apple <em>were</em> to carve out an exception for Twitter creator subscriptions, it certainly wouldn&#39;t be to only take 30 percent of what X Corp keeps from these subscriptions, especially given these — admittedly creator-friendly — terms.</p><p> Second, even if Apple were in the habit of carving out case-by-case exceptions to their in-app-purchase revenue split terms — and they&#39;re not — why in the world would they grant such an exception to X Corp, when Musk&#39;s oft-stated goal is to grow the platform into an “everything app” that encompasses chat, shopping, banking, entertainment, publishing, ride-hailing, and more. Gaming, of course, would be an area near and dear to Apple&#39;s financial interests. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">As I wrote about this “everything app” pipe dream last October</a> , the exemplars in Asia — WeChat in China, Line in Japan, etc. — are best thought of not as <em>apps</em> but as <em>platforms</em> , and we already have platforms that encompass everything: iOS and Android. This is why Apple (and Google) feel fully justified in taking their cuts of digital-goods transactions on their platforms — they&#39;re the ones who built the platforms that enable this commerce. If Musk were to succeed in building X into an “everything app”, it would implicitly mean usurping the role iOS and Android play today as the everything platforms. Why would Apple help X Corp get started down that path by agreeing to let them conduct reduced-fee — let alone no-fee — transactions?</p><p> Third, it&#39;s striking to me that Musk only mentions Apple and Tim Cook. Not a word about Android. One factor is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738370/google-play-cut-music-streaming-apps-10-percent-regulation">Google dropped the Play Store&#39;s revenue split for content subscriptions to 85/15</a> two years ago. I think Apple should drop their entire App Store fee structure to a flat 85/15, for purchases and subscriptions alike, for everything <em>other</em> than gaming (which is both where the money is and where a 70/30 split remains commensurate with the rest of the industry). But still, Google is charging 15 percent on every Twitter/X creator subscription made using the Android app. I suspect they&#39;re escaping Musk&#39;s attention simply because people on Android spend so much less money than people on iOS.</p><p> Last, Musk doesn&#39;t mention that these creator subscriptions can be made on X Corp&#39;s website (twitter.com). Why not just pull the in-app subscriptions from X&#39;s iPhone app and steer all purchases to the web? Probably because people are far less likely to subscribe over the web — which makes Apple&#39;s case for them that they&#39;re entitled to a hefty cut for having built a platform where people are so willing to buy and subscribe to things.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Oh to Be a Fly on the Wall During the Conversation Where Elon Musk Asks Tim Cook to Help X Corp Replace iOS as the Bedrock Everything Platform</title></entry><entry><title> Apple Q3 2023 Results </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-results" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40146</id><published> 2023-08-04T00:28:18Z</published><updated> 2023-08-04T00:28:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> Apple announced its results for its fiscal third quarter on Thursday. As expected, it was a down quarter — though at a 1% drop over the year-ago quarter, it&#39;s a better result than the previous quarter, which was down 3% year-over-year. The company reported $81.8B in revenue and $19.9B in profit.</p><p> The three key hardware categories were all down year-over-year: Mac was down 7%, iPad was down 20%, and the all-important iPhone was down 2%. Things were a little different in the two portions of Apple&#39;s business that have shown indefatigable growth in recent years: Services revenue was up 8% and the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category was up 2%.</p><p> In <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">a press release accompanying the results</a> , Apple CFO Luca Maestri trumpeted that it has broken the billion paid subscriptions barrier.</p></blockquote><p> No big surprises. Still lots of switchers coming to iPhone and Mac, and a lot of first-time iPad buyers. That, to me, is a healthy pulse check.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Q3 2023 Results’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-results">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Card&#39;s Savings Account Reached $10 Billion in Deposits </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-cards-savings-account-by-goldman-sachs-sees-over-10-billion-usd-in-deposits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-card-savings" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40145</id><published> 2023-08-03T22:26:07Z</published><updated> 2023-08-04T00:08:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Today, Apple announced that Apple Card&#39;s high-yield Savings account offered by Goldman Sachs has reached over $10 billion in deposits from users since launching in April. Savings enables Apple Card users to grow their Daily Cash rewards with a Savings account from Goldman Sachs, which offers a high-yield APY of 4.15 percent.</p></blockquote><p> Last week, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-the-partnership-between-apple-and-goldman-soured?rc=jfy0lk">in The Information</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As of earlier this year, the Apple Card had roughly 10 million users, according to a person with direct knowledge of the figure, which hasn&#39;t been previously reported.</p></blockquote><p> That works out to a nice even $1,000 average per Apple Card user. I&#39;m guessing though, that the <em>median</em> is much lower, and the mean average is $1,000 because a smaller number of users have transferred large amounts to take advantage of the 4.15 percent interest rate. (I currently get 3.93 percent from TD Bank, so I just use my Apple Card savings account for my cash back rewards.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Card’s Savings Account Reached $10 Billion in Deposits’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-card-savings">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Watch Ultra 2 to Be Available in Dark Titanium, Says Leaker </title><link href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1686388137633918976" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/dark-apple-watch-ultra" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40144</id><published> 2023-08-03T15:18:36Z</published><updated> 2023-08-03T15:30:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Leaker ShrimpApplePro, on Twitter/X: <sup>*</sup></p><blockquote><p> Apple Watch Ultra 2. Same design. And I can confirm this year we will have the black titanium this year along with the current standard titanium.</p></blockquote><p> Yours truly, reviewing the Apple Watch Ultra last year:</p><blockquote><p> I don&#39;t own the silver link bracelet to try it, but I suspect it <em>doesn&#39;t</em> play paired with the Ultra. Brushed stainless steel and titanium are too different to be considered a match, but too similar to have deliberate contrast. I wish Apple were committed enough to the Link Bracelet to make a new one in titanium to match the case of the Ultra. (I also hope that future generations of Apple Watch Ultra are available with a space gray or black coating.)</p></blockquote><p> The last Apple Watch I bought for myself was a Series 7 in space black titanium. Given that the original Ultra was a hit, it seems like a no-brainer to offer it in a dark option this year. I think the biggest logistical complication for Apple with this is that it will multiply <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands/apple-watch-ultra-49mm">the number of Ultra straps they need to offer</a> — the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands have titanium fixtures that ought to match the watch case, and ideally, they&#39;d color match the buckle hardware on the elastomer Ocean Bands too. But there&#39;s a reason they put the COO in charge of Apple Watch.</p><p> One question I have: is the Action button going to remain orange, or is that color going to change each year? I&#39;m hoping it stays orange. (The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">orange hints on Vision Pro&#39;s head strap</a> suggest the color is more than a seasonal fad.)</p><p> ( <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/">Via MacRumors</a> .)</p><p> <small>* I&#39;ll drop the “Twitter” when twitter.com starts redirecting to x.com, and not the other way around. Even with the slapdash way they&#39;ve enacted this name change, you&#39;d think that would&#39;ve happened by now. Must be a complicated mess behind the scenes.</small></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Watch Ultra 2 to Be Available in Dark Titanium, Says Leaker’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/dark-apple-watch-ultra">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Arc 1.0 </title><link href="https://arc.net/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz3" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/arc" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40143</id><published> 2023-08-02T22:11:38Z</published><updated> 2023-08-03T01:03:28Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Upstart web browser Arc, which remains exclusive to the Mac <a href="https://arc.net/">for now</a> , is out of beta. I find Arc hard to explain in a nutshell, and personally, it&#39;s not for me. But I&#39;ve got some friends who really dig it, and I can see why. It&#39;s a rethinking of how a web browser should look and work. It&#39;s less like a traditional browser and more like a virtual environment/platform unto itself, where tabs are more like apps inside a parent Arc window.</p><p> The reason it doesn&#39;t resonate with me is that I&#39;m both deeply accustomed to <em>and really like</em> Safari. But if you find yourself dissatisfied with Safari and other traditional browsers like Chrome, you should definitely give Arc a look. It&#39;s clever and ambitious. Ultimately they&#39;re a company that&#39;s just trying to make a really great, novel web browser for power users. I even love the name of the company: <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company of New York</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Arc 1.0’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/arc">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Flighty 3.0 </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/flight-tracker-flighty-adds-a-private-social-network-for-tracking-loved-ones-travels/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz2" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/flighty-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40142</id><published> 2023-08-02T21:17:22Z</published><updated> 2023-08-04T16:55:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch last week:</p><blockquote><p> With today&#39;s launch of Flighty 3.0, users will have a new way of sharing their flight information with trusted others, without having to rely on forwarding airline confirmation emails or sending texts.</p><p> Instead, Flighty is introducing the concept of “Flighty Friends,” a way to track loved ones&#39; flight details automatically. The concept builds on the friends&#39; flights feature already available in previous versions of Flighty, which allowed users to share their live flight information with others through the app.</p><p> Now, users can connect directly with one another in Flighty — similar to how you would “friend” someone on a social network. Afterward, the connected users would receive updates about their family members&#39; or friends&#39; flights on an ongoing basis. The app&#39;s notifications would then read something like “mom has landed,” instead of just noting a flight number has landed, and would include the user&#39;s profile photo.</p></blockquote><p> Terrific update to one of my very favorite iOS apps. We don&#39;t fly a ton, but my family flies often enough that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1358823008">Flighty</a> &#39;s $89/year family plan feels like a bargain. It&#39;s just $49/year for a single-user account. Everything about Flighty is just so nice, and so convenient. Its Live Activities widget is so well done that Apple featured Flighty in the WWDC keynote, and gave it an Apple Design Award this year.</p><p> Last year I had a flight get cancelled about an hour before it was supposed to start boarding. I got an alert from Flighty, immediately dashed over to the nearest gate agent, and got rebooked on another flight <em>before</em> American Airlines notified me that the original flight had been cancelled.</p><p> Back in January <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/meanwhile_over_in_androidtown" title="Daring Fireball: Meanwhile, Over in Androidtown">I wrote about the vast discrepancy between best-of-breed apps on iOS compared to Android</a> , using Mastodon clients as an example.

Biden Jr.</p><p> The indictment was filed by the special counsel Jack Smith in Federal District Court in Washington.

This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications.

<p>Katie Paul and Sheila Dang, reporting for Reuters, “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/meta-plans-retention-hooks-threads-more-than-half-users-leave-app-2023-07-28/">Meta Plans Retention &#39;Hooks&#39; for Threads as More Than Half of Users Leave App</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Meta Platforms executives are heavily focused on boosting retention on their new Twitter rival Threads, after the app lost more than half of its users in the weeks following its buzzy launch, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday. Retention of users on the text-based app was better than executives had expected, though it was “not perfect,” said Zuckerberg, speaking at an internal company town hall, the audio of which was heard by Reuters.</p><p> “Obviously, if you have more than 100 million people sign up, ideally it would be awesome if all of them or even half of them stuck around. We&#39;re not there yet,” he said. Zuckerberg said he considered the drop-off “normal” and expected retention to grow as the company adds more features to the app, including a desktop version and search functionality.</p></blockquote><p> Of course there was going to be a drop-off in usage after the initial influx. When brick-and-mortar stores and restaurants have successful grand openings, no one expects that opening traffic not to drop off. By <em>all</em> accounts, Threads has tens of millions of daily users despite being brand new and not yet offering a web interface.</p><p> [ <strong>Sidenote:</strong> It is a bit depressing that among normal people, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/CvAkXe3LOpc/">web apps are equated with “desktop”</a> . But it&#39;s not surprising. People want to use Threads from their desktop computers, and to them, that means typing “threads.net” in their web browser.]</p><p> But this narrative that Threads is a bust <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230727/p38#a230727p38">took hold over the weekend</a> :</p><ul><li> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/zuck-says-threads-doing-better-than-expected-despite-losing-over-half-of-users/">Ars Technica</a> : “Most of the 100 Million People Who Signed Up for Threads Stopped Using It”</li><li> <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/28/elon-musk-touts-record-number-of-x-users-as-threads-stumbles/">The New York Post</a> : “Elon Musk Touts Record Number of X Users as Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Threads Stumbles”</li><li> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-lost-more-than-half-its-users-mark-zuckerberg-says-2023-7?op=1">Insider</a> : “Over Half the People Who Signed Up for Threads Have Stopped Using It Already, Prompting Mark Zuckerberg to Push for &#39;Hooks&#39; to Entice Users, Report Says”</li></ul><p> Dare Obasanjo, writing on Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@carnage4life/post/CvTYp1AJ00Z/">retorted perfectly</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The idea that an app that is clearly an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) doesn&#39;t have 100 million active users is a failure is the sort of addle brained thinking that the tech media has saddled us with.</p><p> The tech press can only write 3 stories:</p><ul><li> This company is a success</li><li> This company is a failure</li><li> Look how much funding this company got</li></ul></blockquote><p> Arguably, “look how much funding this company got” stories are just variations on the first two, depending on the sum of the funding.</p><p> A retention rate of 40-50 percent for a new app is excellent. I see no reason to doubt Zuckerberg&#39;s claim that Threads&#39;s retention is higher than they expected. All you need to do is <em>use</em> Threads to see that it&#39;s thriving. Is it on a path to long-term success? I don&#39;t see how anyone could say that so early, but it sure seems more likely than not. And we haven&#39;t even yet mentioned the fact that Threads is not yet available in the entire EU.</p><p> One interesting data point comes from Google&#39;s Play Store, where the top free apps in the “Social” category look like this, as I write at 8pm ET:</p><ol><li> TikTok</li><li> Instagram</li><li> Facebook</li><li> Threads</li><li> X</li><li>红迪网</li><li>Facebook Lite</li><li> Bigo Live</li><li> Text Free</li><li> Plenty of Fish Dating App</li></ol><p> Earlier this evening, that same list had apps 4–7 — Threads, X, Reddit, and Facebook Lite — in a different order. I take this to mean that the first 3 are the big 3, and the next 4 are close to each other in a second tier. And then there&#39;s a dropoff to weird apps.</p><p> The “social networking” category is very different on Apple&#39;s App Store, because many of these apps aren&#39;t in the “social networking” category. In the App Store, the top 5 in the category are WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger; on Android, WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram (and Snapchat!) are all in the “communications” category. And Instagram and Snapchat are in the “photo and video” category. X, just like when it was named Twitter, is in the “News” category, where it can look more popular than it actually is.</p><p> Here&#39;s where these apps rank amongst <em>all</em> apps on the App Store:</p><p> 5. TikTok<br /> 6. WhatsApp<br /> 9. Instagram<br /> 13. Facebook<br /> 16. Telegram<br /> 18. Snapchat<br /> 21. Threads<br /> 31. Messenger<br /> 35. X</p><p> They use different ranking formulas (and both keep their formulas secret, to thwart attempts to game the rankings), but both the App Store and Play Store have Threads ahead of X. You&#39;d never guess that from this weekend&#39;s “Threads is a bust” headlines.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nobody Uses Threads Anymore, It&#39;s Too Crowded </title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.warp.dev/?source=df2" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyv" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/warp_your_terminal_reimagined" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40135</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-08-01T00:50:11Z</published><updated> 2023-08-01T00:50:11Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Naomi Nix and Will Oremus, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> With a mandate from Zuckerberg to take a big risk, Mosseri assembled a lean, engineer-heavy team of fewer than 60 people to hack together a bare-bones app on a breakneck timetable more reminiscent of a start-up than an entrenched tech giant. Speaking to investors this week after Meta reported strong earnings, Zuckerberg held up Threads as vindication of his “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/25/meta-layoffs-future-facebook-instagram-company/">year of efficiency</a> ,” in which he sheared tens of thousands of jobs in a bid for more agile teams that would ship products quickly.</p><p> That Threads was created by such a small group in such a short amount of time has become something of a marvel inside Meta, according to current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, as well as private messages viewed by The Post. Many see its quick rise as a reminder that well-executed product launches might not need all the bureaucratic trappings that a company with some 66,000 employees had grown accustomed to.</p><p> “Quick execution. Nothing fancy,” one person wrote on Blind, an anonymous workplace app. “Just solid engineering that most of our <em>ICs</em> [individual contributors] can do but unfortunately are shackled.”</p></blockquote><p> It continues to astound me that anyone with any experience whatsoever would express surprise that a small-ish talented team was so effective. (I say “ish” because 50-60 people isn&#39;t all that small.) Fred Brooks&#39;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a></em> is somehow simultaneously famous and widely-ignored. A larger team would likely have delayed Threads, not accelerated its launch. A <em>much</em> larger team might have doomed the project to failure.</p><blockquote><p> To keep things moving, the Threads team punted thorny decisions and eschewed difficult features, including private messages and the ability to search for content or view the feeds of people you don&#39;t follow. The company also opted not to launch in the European Union, where regulators are preparing to enforce new rules next year requiring tech companies to provide more information to regulators about their algorithms.</p><p> “You do the simple thing first,” Mosseri said. “And I think that also helps reduce the scope, because often what happens is scope creep and you want to add all these things because they&#39;re all great.”</p></blockquote><p> Get something good out, even if it&#39;s missing obvious important features, and start iterating. That&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">the recipe</a> . I&#39;m very curious what the story is going to be for private messages on Threads, though — yet another new messaging silo, or something tied to Instagram&#39;s? Whatever it is, I sure hope it uses E2EE.</p><p> (Twitter DMs, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">infamously</a> , do not use E2EE, so every single ostensibly private message ever sent on Twitter is readable by Twitter employees with access privileges, and thus potentially exposable to the public by either a bug or spite. The same goes for Mastodon, which offers “mentioned people only” messaging, a feature that should not exist, in my opinion, because it creates the illusion of privacy. Better to offer no private messaging at all than offer it without E2EE.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inside Meta’s Threads Launch’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/inside-threads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Research Suggests Facebook&#39;s Algorithm Is &#39;Influential&#39; but Doesn&#39;t Necessarily Change Beliefs </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/technology/facebook-instagram-algorithms.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyt" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/facebook-research" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40133</id><published> 2023-07-31T19:59:42Z</published><updated> 2023-08-01T21:04:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel, reporting last week for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> In the papers, researchers from the University of Texas, New York University, Princeton and other institutions found that removing some key functions of the social platforms&#39; algorithms had “no measurable effects” on people&#39;s political beliefs. In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8424?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D61761082717445531361376140889916401782%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1690482061">one experiment</a> on Facebook&#39;s algorithm, people&#39;s knowledge of political news declined when their ability to reshare posts was removed, the researchers said.</p><p> At the same time, the consumption of political news on Facebook and Instagram was highly segregated by ideology, according to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade7138?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D61761082717445531361376140889916401782%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1690482061">another study</a> . More than 97 percent of the links to news stories rated as false by fact checkers on the apps during the 2020 election drew more conservative readers than liberal readers, the research found. [...] Still, the proportion of false news articles that Facebook users read was low compared with all news articles viewed, researchers said.</p></blockquote><p> False news articles were low overall, but the articles deemed false were overwhelming consumed by conservatives. That&#39;s no surprise, but to me, gets to the heart of the controversy. A hypothetical social media algorithm that promotes true stories and suppresses false ones, with perfect accuracy, is going to be accused by conservatives of being biased against conservatives, because conservatives are drawn to false stories.</p><p> Jeff Horwitz, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-facebook-polarize-users-meta-disagrees-with-partners-over-research-conclusions-24fde67a">reporting for The Wall Street Journal</a> ( <a href="https://apple.news/AZgaujY9rTG2a3TFHtLQryw">News+ link</a> ), on Facebook overstating the degree to which these new studies exonerate its platforms&#39; influence:</p><blockquote><p> Science warned Meta earlier this week that it would publicly dispute an assertion that the published studies should be read as largely exonerating Meta of a contributing role in societal divisions, said Meagan Phelan, who oversees the communication of Science&#39;s findings.</p><p> “The findings of the research suggest Meta algorithms are an important part of what is keeping people divided,” Phelan told Meta&#39;s communications team on Monday, according to an excerpt of her message she shared with The Wall Street Journal. She added that one of the studies found that “compared to liberals, politically conservative users were far more siloed in their news sources, driven in part by algorithmic processes, and especially apparent on Facebook&#39;s Pages and Groups.”</p></blockquote><p> <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-social-media-polarize-voters-unprecedented-experiments-facebook-users-reveal">Kai Kupferschmidt&#39;s summary of the four studies for Science</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Research Suggests Facebook’s Algorithm Is ‘Influential’ but Doesn’t Necessarily Change Beliefs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/facebook-research">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Twitter Finally Turns to &#39;X&#39; in App Store Listing </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/twitter-turns-to-x-apple-app-store/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uys" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/twitter-x-app-store-finally" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40132</id><published> 2023-07-31T17:38:35Z</published><updated> 2023-07-31T17:38:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.

<p>Actual headline on ZDNet this week: “ <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apple-needs-a-foldable-iphone-soon-or-iphones-wont-be-worth-buying">Apple Needs a Foldable iPhone Soon or iPhones Won&#39;t Be Worth Buying</a> ”. Philip Berne writes:</p><blockquote><p> Since I bought my iPhone 14 Pro, much cooler phones have come along, and all of them are foldable phones. If Apple doesn&#39;t make a foldable iPhone soon, there won&#39;t be any excitement left, and Apple&#39;s phones will be hard to recommend against the new innovations.</p></blockquote><p> The promise of a foldable device — pocketable folded, tablet-sized unfolded — is obvious. I&#39;ve <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">often</a> held up the super-thin foldable tablets on <em>Westworld</em> as a vision for the future. But the key adjective there is “super-thin”. Double-thick foldables strike me as a niche, and today&#39;s foldables are double-expensive, not just double-thick. Samsung&#39;s new Fold 5, the phone that prompted Berne&#39;s clickbait column, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold5/buy/">starts at $1,800</a> , and offers no dust resistance, only water.</p><p> A decade ago Apple was late to the big-ass phone game. We called them “phablets” then; we call them “phones” now. Those big Android phones were selling well. In a 2013 presentation for planning the company&#39;s 2014 strategy (which became public during discovery in the <em>Apple v. Samsung</em> lawsuit), Apple itself described the situation thus: “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/4/5571926/apple-document-shows-concern-for-iphone-sales-decline-need-for-bigger-iPhone">Consumers want what we don&#39;t have</a> .” (The first larger-screen iPhone, the iPhone 6 Plus, was announced in September 2014.)</p><p> I would wager heavily there were no “Consumers want what we don&#39;t have” slides at Apple this year regarding foldables.</p><p> <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/survey-28-of-us-smartphone-users-highly-likely-to-opt-for-a-foldable-as-next-purchase/">Here&#39;s a report from Counterpoint</a> , who seem <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-foldable-smartphone-shipments-2027/">quite bullish</a> about foldables in the coming years:</p><blockquote><p> In 2022, the foldables category occupied 1.1% of global smartphone shipments, but it scored a vital presence in the ultra-premium segment, taking about 7% of shipments of smartphones priced above $800. According to Counterpoint Research&#39;s Global Foldable Smartphone Market Forecast, Q3 2022, the global foldable smartphone market is expected to reach 22.7 million units in 2023.</p></blockquote><p> 1 percent of total phones and 7 percent of $800+ phones are not big numbers, and I find that 7 percent figure <em>very</em> hard to believe. <a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys/status/1663133413220515840">Here&#39;s a recent report from another firm</a> , Canalys, which lists the top 15 $500+ best-selling phones in the world for Q1 2023. The only foldable on the list, in 10th place, is Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Z Flip4. Not a single book-style foldable on the list, and the Z Flip4 was only a hair ahead of the iPhone SE.</p><p> Foldables — book-style, flip-style, or both — may well become a thing, but they are not yet a thing, because the technology isn&#39;t there yet to make them compelling. (Including simply making them dust resistant.)</p><p> Berne continues:</p><blockquote><p> The Galaxy S23 Ultra is my favorite phone, and tops our best phones list, because it does everything and more. It&#39;s practically a laptop computer stuffed into a phone. Apple isn&#39;t about stuffing. Apple is about refinement.</p></blockquote><p> Doing more than everything is quite an accomplishment. I&#39;m 110 percent surprised I haven&#39;t heard more about this.</p><blockquote><p> Apple, I&#39;ve got good news. The iPhone is refined enough. It is refined well beyond what other manufacturers even care to accomplish. Other phone makers could build a phone that pays just as much attention to detail, they just don&#39;t care to do so. It isn&#39;t worth the effort or cost.</p></blockquote><p> Other basketball players could play as well as Michael Jordan, they just don&#39;t care to do so. It isn&#39;t <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/michael-jordan-net-worth-7552678">worth</a> the cost or effort.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Jackasses of the Week: TechRadar (Foldable Phones Edition)</title></entry><entry><title> X Corp Has Updated Their Mobile Apps, Finally, But the iOS App Is Still &#39;Twitter&#39; in the App Store </title><link href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyn" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/x-app-android-ios" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40127</id><published> 2023-07-28T20:43:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-29T00:54:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Any normal company planning a product name change would have everything sorted out with the iOS App Store and Android Play Store ahead of time. Needless to say, X Corp is not a normal company and so of course they didn&#39;t have anything sorted out. Yesterday an update to the Twitter app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">appeared in Google&#39;s Play Store</a> , with a new icon and new app name: “X”.</p><p> Today, an update to the Twitter app finally appeared on Apple&#39;s App Store. It has the new icon, but the app&#39;s name in the store is still “Twitter”. The app&#39;s description calls it X, though:</p><blockquote><p> The X app is the trusted digital town square for everyone.</p></blockquote><p> And the name of the app installed on your device is “X”.是什么赋予了？ On <s>Twitter</s> X, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickjsheriff/status/1684935759529480192">Nick Sheriff points to a rule</a> I heretofore wasn&#39;t aware of. Apple doesn&#39;t allow single-character app names:</p><blockquote><p> On iOS, the situation is distinct as Apple does not permit any app to have a single character as their app name.</p><p> If they manage to obtain approval, it would mark the first instance since the inception of the iOS App Store that such a permission has been granted.</p></blockquote><p> The rule Sheriff is referencing is about an app&#39;s <em>title</em> in the App Store, not the name of the app as it appears on your device. So who&#39;s going to budge?

<p>Lovely, heartfelt salute to MKBHD from Jon “Front Page Tech” Prosser. Brownlee is so good at what he does, it almost defies description. His reviews are fair, deeply informed, and fun to watch. His taste is exquisite. He&#39;s a dynamic, compelling presence on screen. He&#39;s incredibly prolific yet always leaves you wanting more. The production values of his videos push the envelope of the state of the art: they look and sound (including the music) better than anything else on YouTube, and top YouTubers long ago surpassed broadcast TV in this regard. He&#39;s simultaneously an expert pundit, worldwide on-camera star, and talented filmmaker.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jon Prosser on Marques Brownlee’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/prosser-mkbhd">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Esther Crawford on Twitter, Before and After Charles Foster Musk&#39;s Takeover </title><link href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1684291048682684416" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/crawford-twitter-x" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40125</id><published> 2023-07-28T01:02:11Z</published><updated> 2023-07-29T00:20:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Esther Crawford (previously mentioned <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/28/musk-crawford-haha">here</a> , when she bragged about sleeping at work to meet an unnecessary deadline at Twitter), wrote a fascinating essay about her time at the company, before and after Musk&#39;s acquisition.</p><blockquote><p> Although I didn&#39;t know much about Elon I was cautiously optimistic — I saw him as the guy who built incredible and enduring companies like Tesla and SpaceX, so perhaps his private ownership could shake things up and breathe new life into the company.</p></blockquote><p> Crawford was inside the company, and I&#39;m far outside it, but that&#39;s exactly why <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/27/musk-twitter-open-letter">I was optimistic</a> about Twitter under Musk too. Twitter had ossified years ago — maybe a decade ago — and needed a drastic shake-up, a jolt to the entire system, both in the company&#39;s culture and the product. And while I think Twitter under Musk is now far worse, he absolutely did shake things up, and the overall state of Twitter-like-services is today far, far better than it was before. Mastodon was irrelevant pre-Musk-buying-Twitter. The growth it saw after November never would have happened otherwise. I&#39;m now optimistically bullish on Threads, and I don&#39;t think Threads would even exist if not for Musk buying and wrecking Twitter.</p><p> I thought this was a keen insight:</p><blockquote><p> Elon has an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a different type of social-emotional intelligence.</p></blockquote><p> Another way to think about this (and I&#39;m cribbing from something Ben Thompson said on <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> this week) isn&#39;t about Musk&#39;s lack of empathy, but simply the nature of software itself. The immutable laws of physics push back against Musk&#39;s unreasonable demands in ways that aren&#39;t applicable to software. He doesn&#39;t seem to listen to people who disagree with him, but he has to listen when physics disagrees. ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/tesla-range-estimates">Today&#39;s earlier story</a> about Tesla fudging range estimates is purely dictated by software.)</p><p> Software demands more creative discipline than hardware, because so much discipline is baked into the nature of creating hardware. Hardware instills discipline in people; people must instill discipline into software.</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t note that in all of this there is also a cautionary tale for anyone who succeeds at something — which is that <em>the higher you climb, the smaller your world becomes</em> . It&#39;s a strange paradox but the richest and most powerful people are also some of the most isolated.</p><p> I found myself frequently looking at Elon and seeing a person who seemed quite alone because his time and energy was so purely devoted to work, which is not the model of a life I want to live.</p></blockquote><p> Charles Foster Musk, muttering “X” instead of “Rosebud”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Esther Crawford on Twitter, Before and After Charles Foster Musk’s Takeover’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/crawford-twitter-x">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;We Can&#39;t Just Keep Handing Out Water&#39; </title><link href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/eagle-pass-abbott-border-18210479.php" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/handing-out-water" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40124</id><published> 2023-07-28T00:28:29Z</published><updated> 2023-07-28T16:06:13Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Benjamin Wermund and Jhair Romero, reporting for The Houston Chronicle ( <a href="https://apple.news/AF2RAzWt-TTKozz2cgBWHNw">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Several migrants asked for water but were turned down by troopers who said there was none, even though cases of bottled water were kept at many of the military-like outposts along the river.</p><p> Olivarez said earlier in the day that troopers are told to use their judgment and discretion when deciding to distribute drinking water. He said the state cannot give a bottle to everyone when 600 to 1,000 people are crossing every day.</p><p> “If they see a child or an adult that looks like they&#39;re suffering from some kind of heat exhaustion, they&#39;ll give them water,” Olivarez said. “But we can&#39;t just keep handing out water because what&#39;s going to happen is, you&#39;re going to continue to encourage them to come.”</p></blockquote><p> This is how you know Texas governor Greg Abbott <a href="https://elefanti.co/@adam/110786985323665974">is an idiot</a> — the cruelty in this passage is off the charts.

<p>Steve Stecklow and Norihiko Shirouzu, reporting for Reuters:</p><blockquote><p> Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles&#39; potential driving distance — by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.</p><p> Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.</p><p> The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said. “Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”</p></blockquote><p> This is not an “everyone does” situation:</p><blockquote><p> Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche. All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.</p></blockquote><p> Starting to pick up a pattern with this guy Musk.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tesla’s Exaggerated Range Estimates’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/tesla-range-estimates">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kindness as a Signifier of Intelligence </title><link href="https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1673659149417078788" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyi" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/pritzker-kindness-intelligence" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40122</id><published> 2023-07-27T16:23:55Z</published><updated> 2023-07-27T16:40:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>This clip from Illinois governor JB Pritzker&#39;s commencement speech at Northwestern rings so true to me. The older I get, the more my thinking runs along the exact same line. Worth watching the whole clip, but here&#39;s the nut:</p><blockquote><p> The best way to spot an idiot? Look for the person who is cruel. When we see someone who doesn&#39;t look like us, or sound like us, or act like us, or love like us, or live like us — the first thought that crosses almost everyone&#39;s brain is rooted in either fear or judgment or both. That&#39;s evolution. We survived as a species by being suspicious of things we aren&#39;t familiar with.</p><p> In order to be kind, we have to shut down that animal instinct and force our brain to travel a different pathway. Empathy and compassion are evolved states of being. They require the mental capacity to step past our most primal urges. I&#39;m here to tell you that when someone&#39;s path through this world is marked with acts of cruelty, they have failed the first test of an advanced society. They never forced their animal brain to evolve past its first instinct. They never forged new mental pathways to overcome their own instinctual fears. And so, their thinking and problem-solving will lack the imagination and creativity that the kindest people have in spades.</p><p> Over my many years in politics and business, I have found one thing to be universally true: the kindest person in the room is often the smartest.</p></blockquote><p> I like the idea of responding to acts of cruelty with “Idiot”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kindness as a Signifier of Intelligence’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/pritzker-kindness-intelligence">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/translation_yaccarino_x" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uyg" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40120</id><published> 2023-07-26T23:30:19Z</published><updated> 2023-07-27T22:19:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> “It&#39;s OK to day-drink.

<p>Company-wide memo from nominal X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/24/read-ceo-linda-yaccarinos-message-to-twitter-staff-about-the-rebrand-to-x.html">sent this morning</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Hi team,</p><p> What a momentous weekend.</p></blockquote><p> Everyone said to me, “ <em>Linda, what are you thinking? You don&#39;t want to work for that guy. He&#39;s crazy and impulsive. You&#39;ve got a great job at NBC. You&#39;ve got a great future ahead of you. If you take this job it&#39;ll tank your career and your name will be a punchline.</em> ” Did I listen to them?</p><blockquote><p> As I said yesterday, it&#39;s extremely rare, whether it&#39;s in life or in business, that you have the opportunity to make another big impression. That&#39;s what we&#39;re experiencing together, in real time. Take a moment to put it all into perspective.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s OK to day-drink.我是。</p><blockquote><p> 17 years ago, Twitter made a lasting imprint on the world. The platform changed the speed at which people accessed information. It created a new dynamic for how people communicated, debated, and responded to things happening in the world. Twitter introduced a new way for people, public figures, and brands to build long lasting relationships. In one way or another, everyone here is a driving force in that change. But equally all our users and partners constantly challenged us to dream bigger, to innovate faster, and to fulfill our great potential.</p></blockquote><p> Twitter was a simple concept with profound impact.</p><blockquote><p> <em>With X we will go even further to transform the global town square — and impress the world all over again.</em></p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s not just you. I have no idea what&#39;s going on either.</p><blockquote><p> Our company uniquely has the drive to make this possible.</p></blockquote><p> Fucking Elon.</p><blockquote><p> Many companies say they want to move fast — but we enjoy moving at the speed of light, and when we do, that&#39;s X.</p></blockquote><p> According to Einstein&#39;s theory of special relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, the object&#39;s mass becomes infinite and so too does the energy required to move it. But this holds true, in degree, for all objects in motion, and a mind-bending aspect of special relativity is that the faster an object is moving, the more slowly it experiences <em>time</em> . If you were able to move at the speed of light, time wouldn&#39;t pass at all. It would be like being damned for eternity, forever caught in the current moment, while the world moves on for everyone else.</p><p> I think about this.</p><blockquote><p> At our core, we have an inventor mindset — constantly learning, testing out new approaches, changing to get it right and ultimately succeeding.</p></blockquote><p> We are hemorrhaging cash and our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/technology/twitter-ad-sales-musk.html">advertisers are still fleeing</a> .</p><blockquote><p> With X, we serve our entire community of users and customers by working tirelessly to preserve free expression and choice, create limitless interactivity, and create a marketplace that enables the economic success of all its participants.</p></blockquote><p> I used to run all advertising for NBCUniversal. Now I&#39;m running an $8/month multi-level marketing scheme where the only users who&#39;ve signed up are men who own a collection of MAGA hats.</p><blockquote><p> The best news is we&#39;re well underway.</p></blockquote><p> There is no hope.</p><blockquote><p> Everyone should be proud of the pace of innovation over the last nine months — from long form content, to creator monetization, and tremendous advancements in brand safety protections.</p></blockquote><p> Have you seen the ads we&#39;re running these days? Last week we were filling everyone&#39;s timeline with ads for discount chewable boner pills, the <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueChew/status/1653025204501721089">punchline of which ads</a> is that you&#39;ll bang your lady so hard she&#39;ll need the aid of a walker afterward. That&#39;s a video we promoted to everyone. This week it&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1684247403065659393">anime for foot fetishists</a> . That&#39;s what we put in everyone&#39;s feed, every three tweets. Or X&#39;s, or whatever we&#39;re now calling them. I used to book hundred-million-dollar Olympic sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Proctor &amp; Gamble. (Thank god <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple/status/1671364902404100102">for Apple</a> .)</p><blockquote><p> Our usage is at an all time high</p></blockquote><p> Our owner is high as a kite.</p><blockquote><p> and we&#39;ll continue to delight our entire community with new experiences in audio, video, messaging, payments, banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.</p></blockquote><p> Our focus group testing suggests that while interest in trusting this platform — which, let&#39;s face it, is not exactly known for its reliability — for <em>banking</em> , of all things, is, as you&#39;d expect, pretty low overall, it&#39;s surprisingly high amongst people who know who Catturd is.</p><blockquote><p> Please don&#39;t take this moment for granted.</p></blockquote><p> Please quit. Get out. I beg you. Leave while you can put on your resume that you worked for “Twitter”.</p><blockquote><p> You&#39;re writing history, and there&#39;s no limit to our transformation.</p></blockquote><p> As if this rebranding disaster isn&#39;t enough, our infrastructure is crumbling. Facebook took Threads from 0 to 100 million users in under a week, without a hitch, at the same time we imposed <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/update-on-twitters-limited-usage.html">comical rate limits</a> on usage. I mean can you even believe that shit? I still can&#39;t. I said to him, “Elon, we are an ad-based business. Our revenue is directly commensurate to usage. This is like running a casino and turning the slot machines off to save on the electricity bill. It makes no sense.” And Elon was like “Bots!”</p><blockquote><p> And everyone, is invited to build X with us.</p></blockquote><p> I think I, saw on a TV show once that a hostage was able, to signal to authorities the need for help without alerting, their captors by placing commas randomly in their sentences.</p><blockquote><p> Elon and I will be working across every team and partner to bring X to the world. That includes keeping our entire community up to date, ensuring that we all have the information we need to move forward.</p></blockquote><p> I found out about this name change when you did, at midnight on Saturday, and I have no idea what that fucker is going to do next or when he&#39;s going to do it. You know this. You know that I know that you know this. But I&#39;m going to persist with the charade that these decisions are being made by a team that I&#39;m a leader of, because to do otherwise would be even more humiliating.</p><blockquote><p> Now, let&#39;s go make that next big impression on the world, together.</p><p>琳达</p></blockquote><p>我很抱歉。</p><p>琳达</p>]]>;</content><title> ★ Translation From Hostage Code to English of X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino&#39;s Company-Wide Memo</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
