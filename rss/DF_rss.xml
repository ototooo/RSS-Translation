<p>我将首先链接到 The Verge 的“ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24250234/meta-connect-rayban-glasses-orion-ai-llama">Meta Connect 2024 上宣布的一切</a>”综述，因为 Meta 尚未在 YouTube 上发布今天的主题演讲；我发现的最好的就是这段直播录音，<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ezXhxAkhJfk?t=2598">从 43 分 20 秒左右开始</a>。我观看了现场主题演讲的大部分内容，发现它很吸引人。只有 45 分钟长——部分原因是信息密集，部分原因是马克·扎克伯格亲自主持了整个活动。他最近看起来很自在、自信、自然。没有什么比一堆副总裁更能拖慢台上主题演讲的节奏了。在这次主题演讲中，Meta 显然没有出现政治内讧。基调是扎克的，因此，它有力而轻快。</p><p>就实际发货的实际产品而言，Meta 宣布了<a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/">300 美元的 Quest 3S</a> 。这比 Vision Pro 的价格低了整整一个数量级。 Vision Pro 的功能可能比 Quest 3S 强 10 倍以上，但我不确定它是否只适合玩游戏和看电影，这可能是人们目前唯一想用耳机做的事情。他们还推出了<a href="https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/wayfarer-limited-edition-shiny-transparent-sapphire-transitions/">7,500 副限量版</a>，售价 430 美元，实际上颇受欢迎的 Ray-Ban Wayfarer“智能”眼镜由 iMac 风格的半透明塑料制成。自从有人制造“看看内部”消费设备以来已经有一段时间了。这很有趣，也有点<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_things_they_carried">古怪</a>。</p><p>最重要的展示是 Orion，这是一款穿透式 AR 眼镜的工作原型。 Meta 本身将它们描述为“开发套件”，但它们不仅无法购买，而且不可用，就这样。它们是 Meta 自己的开发人员的内部原型，而不是外部开发人员。对于演示来说，它们确实看起来很有趣，而且我从门洛帕克现场的<a href="https://dithering.fm/">抖动</a>记者那里听说，使用它们确实很引人注目。毫无疑问，实际的眼镜是 AR 的<em>外形</em>因素。</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview">今天，The Verge 的亚历克斯·希思 (Alex Heath) 在他关于猎户座的</a>文章中这样开头：</p><blockquote><p>它们看起来<em>几乎</em>就像一副普通的眼镜。</p></blockquote><p>这将“几乎”的含义延伸到了极限。我想说它们看起来有点像一副普通眼镜。镜框（超级粗）和镜片（厚，棱柱形，有时发光）都很<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/zuck-orion.jpeg">引人注目</a>。它们看起来像矫形眼镜，旨在帮助那些视力低到法定盲人的人。确实，Meta 的雷朋 Wayfarers 与普通 Wayfarers 几乎没有什么区别。猎户座根本不是那样的。如果您带着这些设备出现在公共场合（您不能这样做，因为它们是内部原型），每个人都会注意到您戴着某种科技眼镜，或者可能会认为您走出电影院时没有归还 3D风镜。但是：如果你愿意的话，你<em>可以</em>在公共场合佩戴它们，而且与在公共场合佩戴 VR 耳机不同，你看起来只是一个书呆子， <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-of-man-crossing-street-with-apple-vision-pro-causes-warning-204528709915">而不是一个混蛋</a>。他们很接近某事。但距离真正重要的东西有多近，尤其是在价格方面，是值得商榷的。来自希斯的报告：</p><blockquote><p>正如 Meta 的高管复述的那样，搁置 Orion 的决定主要是因为该设备的制造成本天文数字，每台大约为 10,000 美元。大部分成本是由于可靠地制造碳化硅透镜非常困难且昂贵。当开始设计 Orion 时，Meta 预计这种材料将在整个行业中得到更广泛的应用，从而变得更便宜，但这一情况并没有发生。</p><p> “你无法想象产量有多么可怕，”Meta 首席技术官 Andrew Bosworth 谈到镜头时说道。相反，该公司转而生产约 1,000 副 Orion 眼镜，用于内部开发和外部演示。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/17/snaps-extremely-large-spectacles-bring-impressive-ar-to-developers-at-99-a-month/">Snap 最近推出了</a>他们的<a href="https://www.spectacles.com/">新款 Spectacles</a> ，他们以每年 1,200 美元的价格出租而不是出售。 Snap 的眼镜<a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snaps-fifth-generation-spectacles-bring-your-hands-into-into-augmented-reality-180026541.html">非常粗壮</a>，与 Orion 相比显得不那么显眼。但将 AR 眼镜推向市场的竞赛显然已经开始。</p><p><strong>另请参阅：</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253481/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-orion-ray-bans-ai-decoder-interview">Heath 对 Decoder 扎克伯格的采访</a>。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 关于 Meta Connect 2024 的一些简单思考</title></entry><entry><title>Masimo 创始人 Joe Kiani 在被赶出董事会后辞去首席执行官职务</title><link href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/masimos-joe-kiani-resigns-ceo-after-board-ouster-2024-09-25/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vrx" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/25/masimo-ceo-resigns" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2024：/linked//6.41181</id><published> 2024-09-25T23:51:31Z</published><updated> 2024-09-25T23:51:31Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Tripp Mickle，为《纽约时报》撰文：</p><blockquote><p>在同意打造一款由 LoveFrom 领导设计的产品之前，艾维先生和奥特曼先生又共进了几次晚餐。他们在艾维和鲍威尔·乔布斯女士的公司 Emerson Collective 的帮助下私下筹集了资金，并可能在今年年底前从科技投资者那里筹集至多 10 亿美元的启动资金。</p><p> 2月份，艾维先生为公司找到了办公场地。他们斥资 6,000 万美元建造了一座 32,000 平方英尺的建筑，名为“小狐狸剧院”，紧邻 LoveFrom 庭院。他雇佣了大约 10 名员工，其中包括负责 iPhone 产品开发的唐坦和接替艾维领导苹果设计的埃文斯·汉基。</p><p>六月底的一个周五早上，人们可以看到谭先生和汉基女士推着轮椅往返于小狐狸剧院和附近的 LoveFrom 工作室之间。椅子上放着纸张和纸板箱，上面放着最早的产品创意，该产品利用人工智能创造一种比 iPhone 更具社会破坏性的计算体验。</p><p>该项目正在秘密开发中。纽森先生表示，该产品是什么以及何时发布仍在确定中。</p></blockquote><p>我觉得米克尔有点埋葬了这里的lede。建筑项目、<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91185536/jony-ives-lovefrom-reinvents-the-button-with-moncler">磁性按钮</a>、价值<a href="https://www.moncler.com/en-us/sir-jony-ive-collaboration.html">2,000 美元的夹克</a>、<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/29/lovefrom-serif">可爱的新字体</a>、电动法拉利跑车的新方向盘——所有这些设计项目都很有趣。但是，由长期担任苹果全明星<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/the_iphones_14_pro#fn6-2022-09-15">埃文斯·汉基 (Evans Hankey)</a>和<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/26/tang-tan-lovefrom">唐坦 (Tang Tan)</a>领导的小团队打造的由 OpenAI 驱动的个人电子设备呢？那很<em>有意思</em>。这是与苹果的竞争。考虑到艾维在苹果公司的传奇历史，这很复杂。 LoveFrom 的大部分设计师都是来自苹果公司的 Ive，这一事实让事情变得更加复杂。鲍威尔·乔布斯对这家初创公司的支持使情况变得更加复杂。</p><p>对我来说也有点有趣的是米克尔的个人资料的时间安排。早在 6 月份，他就曾与 Ive 和 Marc Newson 进行过交谈，但这篇报道是在苹果新款 iPhone、AirPods 和手表上市后的第二天发表的。这个时机可能完全是《纽约时报》的选择。但仍然很难不注意到。</p><p>鉴于 OpenAI 与苹果公司合作，将在今年年底前提供“世界知识”生成式人工智能，整个事情变得更加奇怪。不禁让人想到，当 iPhone 首次亮相时，当时的谷歌首席执行官埃里克·施密特 (Eric Sc​​hmidt) 是苹果董事会成员，内置了谷歌地图和 YouTube 的系统应用程序，而谷歌同时也在开发 Android 来竞争。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Tripp Mickle 介绍 Jony Ive 和 LoveFrom，确认 OpenAI 设备合作伙伴关系”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/23/mickle-ive-lovefrom">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iOS 18 消息错误，在共享 Apple Watch 表盘时触发，导致崩溃和数据丢失</title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/18/ios-18-messages-app-crash/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vro" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/23/ios-18-messages-watch-face-sharing-bug" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2024：/linked//6.41172</id><published> 2024-09-23T16:47:13Z</published><updated> 2024-09-23T16:47:13Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）2007年推出原始iPhone的众多令人难忘的时刻之一是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/sj-buttons.jpeg">这款幻灯片</a>显示了市场上当时领先的智能手机中的四台。工作解释：</p><blockquote><p>现在，为什么我们需要革命性的用户界面？这是四个智能手机，对吗？摩托罗拉Q，黑莓，棕榈树，诺基亚E62  - 通常的嫌疑人。而且，他们的用户界面有什么问题？好吧，他们的问题确实在40的底部。这是那里的东西。他们都有这些键盘，无论您是否需要它们在那里。而且它们都具有这些控制按钮，这些按钮固定在塑料中，并且对于每个应用程序都是相同的。好吧，每个应用程序都需要一个略有不同的用户界面，一组略有优化的按钮，只是为此。</p><p>如果您从现在开始六个月后，您会想到一个好主意会怎样？您无法四处奔跑并在这些事情中添加一个按钮。他们已经发货了。那么你做什么呢？它不起作用，因为按钮和控件无法更改。他们无法为每个应用程序更改，如果您想到要添加到此产品中的另一个好主意，他们将无法改变道路。</p><p>好吧，您如何解决这个问题？唔。事实证明，我们已经解决了它。我们在20年前在计算机中解决了它。我们用位图屏幕解决了它，该屏幕可以显示我们想要的任何内容。将任何用户界面放置。和指向设备。我们用鼠标解决了它。我们解决了这个问题。那么，我们将如何将其带到移动设备？我们要做的就是摆脱所有这些按钮，然后制作一个巨大的屏幕。一个巨大的屏幕。</p></blockquote><p>当时，似乎最激进的是避​​开了硬件<span class="caps">Qwerty</span>键盘，而是在软件中<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/07/27/kocienda-creative-selection">实现</a>触摸屏键盘。当时的微软首席执行官史蒂夫·鲍尔默（Steve Ballmer）<a href="https://parislemon.com/post/17002229521/lets-see-how-the-competition-goes-just-to">在臭名昭著的剪辑中，在被要求看到iPhone的反应后，他嘲笑了他</a>：“ 500美元？完全补贴，有计划吗？我说，<em>这</em>是世界上最昂贵的手机，它不吸引商业客户，因为它没有键盘，这使其不是一台很好的电子邮件机。”</p><p>当然，苹果并没有摆脱<em>所有</em>按钮。但是他们保留的按钮全部用于<em>系统</em>，<em>设备</em>，而不是任何特定的应用：电源，音量，静音开关（奇怪的是，几乎没有竞争对手复制），前面面上的唯一按钮： 。 <sup id="fnr1-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn1-2024-09-18">1</a></sup>就是这样。</p><p>当苹果的竞争对手停止嘲笑iPhone并开始复制iPhone时，他们摆脱了硬件键盘 - 其主要指示符与常规手机区分了“智能手机”  - 但他们无法带来自己来消除不是一个专门的，而是<em>两个</em>专用的手机对于他们的不想像力的硬件按钮是使任何手机成为手机的固有的：绿色的“呼叫”和红色“挂断”按钮。 <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/with-googles-first-android-phone-the-iphone-finally-got-a-rival/">Android手机具有那些红色/绿色按钮</a>。<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Storm">黑莓风暴也有它们</a>。除iPhone以外的每部手机都有它们。直到他们赶上并意识到这些按钮也被避开。</p><p>这种想法可能植根于设备的名称。<em>当然，所有手机 - 愚蠢的电话，黑莓风格的硬件键盘手机，iPhone风格的触摸屏电话 - 都应该有</em>电话<em>按钮。</em>我怀疑他们非常深刻地思考了苹果的大胆如何足以避开硬件键盘，以进行全触摸屏设计，但是他们认为苹果只是通过避开绿色/红色硬件呼叫按钮来使极简主义变得极端。<em>无论他们做多少其他事情，都是电话 - 它的名字就在那里！</em></p><p>但是iPhone从来没有真正成为电话。在iPhone上，手机始终只是另一个应用程序。一个特殊的应用程序，毫无疑问。默认位置在主屏幕底部的码头中。特殊的背景特权在原本高度约束的操作系统中，当您返回主屏幕时，大多数应用程序都会有效地退出。即将到来的电话立即接管了整个屏幕。 Jobs在该简介中花费了大量时间展示电话应用程序 - 包括Visual Voicemail，这是一项真正的突破性功能，需要AT＆T/Cingular的后端合作。 <sup id="fnr2-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn2-2024-09-18">2</a></sup></p><p>但是，当时，iPhone的电话部分仍然是一个应用程序。如果您将iPhone与iPod Touch进行了比较，那么iPhone硬件上没有什么比iPod Touch更重要的是手机，这不仅不是手机，而且甚至没有提供蜂窝网络。肯定没有按钮。无粘性天线。设备上没有载波徽标。看看现代的iPhone，实际上只有一个功能从显着的硬件突出中可以清楚地看到其目的：相机镜头。五年前，在<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/the_iphone_11_and_iphones_11_pro">我对iPhone 11的评论</a>的Lede中，我写道：“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2019/08/28/ep-261">几周前，我的播客中</a>，猜测今年的新iPhone的Tentpole功能，我说&#39;icamera&#39;将是更加贴切的名称而不是“ iPhone”。”</p><p>与每年新型号的后面不断增长的相机镜头或“ <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&amp;q=shot+on+iphone+ad+campaign&amp;ia=web">iPhone上的镜头</a>”广告系列相比）苹果历史上的运动？专用硬件按钮？</p><h2>相机控制</h2><p>便利的看法是，苹果已经用完了硬件的想法，现在每年只为iPhone添加一个新按钮 - 去年的动作按钮，今年的摄像机控制，也许他们明年终于添加了那些绿色/红色的电话按钮。但这在低估了iPhone第18届年度硬件迭代中Apple的根本性，以添加专用于单个应用程序的硬件按钮。</p><p>我的意思是，从一般意义上讲，不仅仅是<em>应用程序</em><em>意义</em>。默认情况下，当然，按下摄像头控制启动iOS相机应用程序<sup id="fnr3-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn3-2024-09-18">3</a></sup> ，但是在设置任何新的iPhone 16时，Apple自己的入职屏幕将其目的描述为启动“摄像机应用程序”，并使用小写<em>c</em> 。任何采用<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/camera-control">新API和指南</a>的第三方应用程序都可以用作摄像机应用程序，该应用程序将通过相机控制启动（并启动，一旦启动，控制）。 （不过，我默认写有关使用系统摄像机应用程序的文章。）</p><p>苹果似乎从未将相机控制称为“按钮”，但这是一个按钮。您可以看到它的凹陷，即使设备电源关闭，它也会单击（与Yore iPhone上的Haptic Touch ID Home按钮不同，Yore和长时间的iPhone SE）。但这<em>不仅</em>是一个按钮。您可以将其视为两个物理控件：一个微型触觉滑块（例如只有一个轴的触控板）<em>和</em>一个实际单击的按钮。</p><p>当相机应用程序尚未处于拍摄模式时（无论您的iPhone在锁定屏幕上还是其他应用程序都处于活动状态），即使您在拍摄以外在相机应用程序中进行其他操作，例如查看现有照片）：</p><ul><li>完全单击相机控制按钮将启动相机应用程序（如有必要），并将您处于射击模式。</li><li>轻时，什么也没有触发，也没有提供任何触觉反馈。当您在相机应用中准备拍摄时，光线只能做点什么。</li></ul><p>当相机应用活动处于活动状态并准备拍摄时：</p><ul><li>完全单击相机控件按钮，请拍摄照片或启动视频，具体取决于您当前的模式。 （如果您处于仍处于光片模式，请单击和挂载的摄像头控件将启动视频，就像按下屏幕上的快门按钮一样。）</li><li>摄像机控件上的轻度按下覆盖层，可通过将手指从左到右滑动，即触控板式，可以调整当前设置模式。</li><li>摄像机控件上的双重按下会更改覆盖层以选择要调整的<em>设置</em>。选项是：曝光，深度（ƒ停留），变焦，摄像头，样式，音调。</li></ul><p>只要写出所有内容，就会听起来很复杂，而且有点复杂。 （这是Apple自己的<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-kw/guide/iphone/iph0c397b154/ios">使用相机控制的插图指南</a>。）相机很复杂。但是，如果您只是将其捣碎，那就拍照。相机控制就像相机应用本身的缩影。只想指向并射击？简单的。是否想摆弄ƒ停留和样式？有一个周到的UI可以做到这一点。在iPhone的早期， <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/ios-5-camera-app-lock-screen-shortcut-volume-shutter-button-and-photo-editing/">Apple的Camera App确实很简单</a>。拍摄接口只有几个按钮：快门，照片/视频切换，闪光灯的控件以及用于切换到前置摄像头的切换。原始的iPhone和iPhone 3G甚至不支持视频，直到iPhone 4之前，前置摄像头才到达。这些旧的iPhone具有简单的相机硬件，并且该应用程序反映了这种简单性。</p><p>苹果的现代相机硬件变得非常复杂，相机应用也具有。但是，如果您只想拍摄您在取景器中看到的东西，那就一如既往地简单。捏到缩放，点击以聚焦，按下快门按钮进行射击。但是，还有许多其他的控件和选项，很容易获得，并为那些想要它们的人提供了巧妙的介绍，而那些不愿意的人很容易被那些没有的人忽略。苹果的相机应用程序是世界上最好的软件之一，也是最精心设计的软件之一。可以说，这也是世界上最受欢迎的界面。您很难找到一部单个高级Android手机，其内置相机应用看起来不像Apple的应用，通常直到文本标签的黄色重音颜色。</p><p>使用几个iPhone 16评论单元一周多了之后，我对相机控制的摘要是要习惯 - 我觉得我仍然习惯了 - 但已经感觉像是我不想要的东西不做。这是一个好主意，也是一个大胆的主意。正如我上面强调的那样，只有在第18个硬件修订中，Apple添加了一个专用于单个应用程序的硬件控件。我不希望苹果再做一次。我确实希望苹果的竞争对手可以无耻地复制相机控制。</p><p>不过，起初，相机控制的身体放置使我感到沮丧。作为一名业余爱好者摄影师，他一直以专用摄像机的形式直到1990年代后期，我的右食指指望一个快门按钮位于右上角附近。但是摄像头控制的中心距离角2英寸（5厘米）。我永远不会停止希望它更靠近角落，但是一周后，我已经适应了它的实际位置。我明白了。我已经足够大，以至于我在宽屏方向拍摄了所有视频和大多数照片。但是今天的社交媒体由高屏视频主导。<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uarNiSl_uh4?t=3462">正如苹果的Piyush Pratik在上周的主题演讲中所解释的那样</a>，相机控制旨在用于宽（景观）和高个子（肖像）方向。将其移到我的手指想要的拐角处，这将使射击宽屏的射击更好，但会使握住iPhone的高高射击时完全pre可危。我讨厌承认，但我认为苹果的位置正确。射击高屏非常受欢迎。而且，仅仅一周之后，我的食指就越来越习惯了它的位置。不过，对于有小手的人来说，这可能是有点触及的。</p><p>当我的iPhone被锁定时，我也通过使用摄像头控制摄像机来启动相机感到有些沮丧。使用默认设置，当您的iPhone解锁或锁定时，但是随着屏幕醒来，单击相机控件将带您正确地在相机应用中拍摄模式。这听起来很明显。但是，当您的iPhone被锁定并且屏幕关闭时，或者在始终在线模式下时，单击相机控件只会唤醒屏幕。屏幕醒来后，您必须再次单击它，以跳到拍摄模式。苹果在这里的思考很明显：他们想在口袋里或从打开相机的钱包中进行摄像机控制的意外点击。与几乎所有其他模式不同，您可以在iPhone上使用相机拍摄模式时，该设备在不活动一两分钟后不会自动入睡。实际上，iOS 18中的当前默认值是仅30秒后自动锁定。 （设置→显示和亮度→自动锁。）在拍摄模式下，相机应用程序将在睡觉之前保持很长时间。当iPhone放在口袋里时，您不希望这种情况无意间发生。</p><p>但是，在上周我遇到的是我的iPhone在口袋里的情况，我看到我想拍摄的东西。这件事在我的妻子和我上周五参加的韦泽音乐会上反复发生。 （很棒的表演。）我想要的是在将iPhone从口袋里取出时单击相机控制，并准备好在我的眼前拍摄时拍摄。这就是On/Oft按钮在我的Ricoh GR IIIX（例如我的Ricoh gr IIIX）上的专用相机上工作的方式。但是，使用iPhone 16，通常，将iPhone从我的口袋中取出时的相机控制的单击只是唤醒了屏幕，而不是将其放入拍摄模式。我需要再次单击它以进入拍摄模式。在短暂的时刻，这足以错过您想拍摄的镜头。这是一个快速绘制的枪手。</p><p>苹果在设置→相机→相机控制→启动相机中提供了更具保护性的选项，以需要双击而不是单击，以启动指定的相机应用程序。在我写这篇文章时，我希望他们还提供一个不太保护的选项，即使手机已锁定并且屏幕已关闭，<em>也</em>可以单击一键启动相机应用程序。一种“<em>我将通过意外点击抓住机会</em>”选项。尽管苹果可能尝试了这一点，但发现无意的点击太常见了。但是就目前而言，没有一个很好的方法可以始终尽快进入射击模式。</p><p>当iPhone锁定并且屏幕关闭时，双击相机控制将使您跳入射击模式。我开始在周末这样做，起初我认为它满足了我的愿望。但是问题在于，如果iPhone已锁定，但屏幕已经醒了，双击相机控件将在第一次单击时跳入相机，并使用第二张照片拍摄照片。因此，我必须删除至少六个模糊的意外镜头。</p><p>避免意外调用的手势是单击相机控制按钮。从理论上讲，苹果可以将其作为启动相机的确定方式，同时将iPhone从口袋里拿出来。但是苹果公​​司保留了视觉智能的点击手势，这是一项新的苹果情报功能，上周宣布。这就是将钉子放在专用“ AI”设备的棺材中的功能，例如<a href="https://humane.com/">Humane的Ai Pin</a>和<a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">Rabbit的R1</a> 。即使在iOS 18.1的开发人员Beta中，视觉智能也尚无可用，但是点击和持有的手势已经保留。 <sup id="fnr4-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn4-2024-09-18">4</a></sup></p><p>因此，我在撰写本文中降落的地方只是想记住只需双击iPhone即可拍摄的相机控制控制屏幕何时已经清醒。我想尝试的唯一其他技术是要记住要始终等到我看到屏幕在单击相机控制之前醒着，在必要时倾斜手机以唤醒手机，但这似乎会违反进入拍摄模式的目的尽快。</p><p>默认情况下，如果您在相机控件上轻击和固定，则几乎所有的UI元素都从取景器屏幕上消失了。拍摄模式选择器（电影，视频，照片，肖像，空间等），变焦按钮（0.5×，1×，1×，2×，5×），前/后置摄像头切换，最新照片的缩略图 - 所有这些都从屏幕上消失，使其像原始iPhone摄像头接口一样整洁。在使用相机控件作为快门按钮时，将其视为半按压。几十年来，专用的硬件相机提供了两个阶段的快门按钮，它们的工作方式类似。使用那些专用的摄像头，您将中途锁定在聚焦距离和曝光下；然后，您可以移动相机以重新组合框架，同时保持重点距离和曝光锁定，然后全力按下以捕获图像。苹果公司已承诺将此功能带入“今年晚些时候”软件更新中所有iPhone 16型号的相机应用程序。 （iOS 18.1 Beta 4中还没有存在，相机控件的精确感觉与真正的两阶段快门按钮的精确感觉完全相同，该按钮在两个单独的抑郁症（两个<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/detent">dittent</a> ）处物理单击，但最终可能在未来的iPhone型号。</p><p>相机控制的一个问题是，由于它的电容性，因此对案例制造商来说很棘手。显而易见的解决方案是在其周围放一个切口，让用户的手指触摸实际的相机控制按钮。苹果对<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/cases-protection">自己的硅树脂和清晰的箱子</a>以及<a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/accessories/phone-cases/beats-iphone-16-magsafe-case">来自子公司节拍的新型聚碳酸酯箱的</a>更优雅的解决方案是“蓝宝石水晶，耦合到导电层，以将手指的运动传达给相机控制”。这听起来不像您将在廉价的20美元案例中看到的东西。在我的测试中，无论是苹果的案例还是Beats，它都可以无缝地工作。不过，我确实认为您失去了一些触觉反馈的感觉。最终，摄像头控制在使用iPhone的最佳方法之前，它比以往任何时候都更加真实。</p><p>相机控制上还有一件事。通过相机控制可调节的功能（再次：曝光，深度（ƒ停留），变焦，相机，样式，音调），“相机”是一个易于忽视的出色表现。变焦提供从0.5×至25.0×的连续十进制增量。也就是说，您可以滑动手指以获得1.7×，3.3×，17.4×等的缩放值。我几乎永远都不想要。我想坚持精确的真实光学增量：0.5×，1×，2×和5倍。这就是“相机”设置模式提供的。将其视为变焦，但仅具有这些精确的值。 （而不是“摄像机”，该设置可能被称为“镜头”，但这可能会令人困惑，因为1×和2×均来自相同的物理镜头；区别在于传感器数据的处理方式。）实际上，I希望我可以进入设置并从相机控件中可用的功能列表中禁用缩放。如果我真的想要非光学变焦级别，我可以使用<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-kw/guide/iphone/iph263472f78/ios">现有的屏幕接口选项</a>。</p><p>显而易见的是，摄影爱好者在苹果中的摄影爱好者对摄影爱好者的工作和感觉非常熟悉。在政治上，它一定是由同一群体倡导的。现在，现在有一个专门用于所有新iPhone的摄影的硬件控制确实令人震惊，这是一个机械复杂的控制。</p><h2>摄影，除了相机控制</h2><p>像往常一周）相机似乎和往常一样好。</p><p>今年的新摄影功能与镜头或传感器无关。这是下一代摄影风格，实际上是“对我们其他人的原始”。这一直是我个人摄影奇特里/热情的边缘。我非常关心摄影，可以在数十年中购买了许多千美元的摄像头（和<a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/50mm-f12.htm">镜头</a>），但是拍摄Raw从来没有对我坚持。我了解它是什么，以及为什么它在技术上优于射击JPEG/HEIC，但这太多了。 RAW使您可以通过POST中的手动开发获得更好的结果，但是您<em>必须</em>在Post中开发，因为原始图像（对不起）看起来很平坦且不饱和。有一段时间，我尝试拍摄RAW + JPEG，其中您拍摄的每个图像都被存储为直接发达的原始文件，又存储了一个模仿pipeline jpeg文件，但事实证明我是从来没有回过头来开发那些原始图像。相对于JPEG/HEIC（从此以后，我只是为了简洁起来称为“射击JPEG”，即使iPhone<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/116944">自七年前11年前iOS</a>违约了效率提高的HEIC格式），Raw Image占10次，RAW Image占10 ×（或更多）存储空间。</p><p>太麻烦了。对于我来说，图像质量的提高我可以消除开发RAW，这是不值得付出的努力。对于许多认真的摄影师而言。每个人都有这样的台词。有些人根本不做任何编辑。他们从不裁剪，从不改变邮政中的曝光，永远不要应用过滤器 - 它们只是指向并射击而完成。对我来说，那条线正在开枪。</p><p>苹果三年前13年前首次使用iPhone引入摄影风格，具有四种自我描述的主要风格：丰富的对比度（我的选择），充满活力，温暖和酷。每种主要样式都提供自定义。找到您喜欢的样式，将其设置为默认设置，然后走上快乐的方式。但是，无论您选择的哪种样式都是iPhone硬件成像管道“开发”照片的方式。多年来，苹果的“过滤器”一直没有破坏性，但是第一代摄影风格被烘烤到它写入存储的HEIC文件中。</p><p>使用iPhone 16阵容，此功能现在更加强大，同时保持方便且易于使用。 <sup id="fnr5-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn5-2024-09-18">5</a></sup>苹果消除了以前称为“过滤器”的东西，并重新创建了更好的样式（例如充满活力和戏剧性的）。现在有15种基础样式可供选择，其中大多数是自我描述的（中性，黄金，玫瑰金），一些诗意的命名（舒适，安静，空灵）。默认样式被命名为标准，它以看起来像iPhone-y的方式处理图像。到目前为止，我迷恋的两个人是自然而鲜明的B＆W。对于我们的许多眼睛来说，标准的iPhone图像处理长期以来一直略有处理。降低噪音过多，平滑过多。有点太强烈。自然在我眼中确实看起来更自然。 Stark B＆W想到了经典的高对比度黑白电影，例如<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170722231438/http://www.absolutephoto.com/index.php/interviews/233-life-without-tri-x">Kodak Tri-X 400</a> 。</p><p>现在，摄影风格的一个关键方面是它们无损。您可以在帖子中改变主意。将默认设置设置为Stark B＆W，然后在照片中进行编辑，您可以使用所需的其他样式改变主意，然后返回全彩色图像。幕后有很多复杂的图像处理 - 包括iPhone 16硬件和iOS 18软件 - 使这似乎没什么大不了的。但是，由于新的摄影风格在很大程度上是基于硬件成像管道的（或完全？），因此即使在升级到iOS 18之后，iPhone 13-15仍将继续使用第一代摄影风格。</p><p>我一直对我懒得开枪的事实感到有些内gui。我怀疑，iPhone 16阵容中的这种下一代摄影风格可能会缓解这种罪恶感的剩余遗迹。</p><h2>设计 - 以及专业与常规问题</h2><p>苹果公司在iPhone 16阵容中为我提供了所有四种型号，以供评论：16中的16个，粉红色的16次，16个Pro在天然钛中，而沙漠钛的16个Pro Max。 Ultramarine是我在内存中任何iPhone上最喜欢的<em>颜色</em>。这是一个有趣的罂粟蓝色，而且充满活力。粉红色也很好，对我的（和我妻子的）眼睛，有紫色的感觉。相机颠簸的颜色额外饱和，看起来很棒。天然钛看起来与去年的iPhone 15 Pro上的天然钛看起来<em>非常</em>相似，即使不是完全相同。 （苹果自己的比较页面 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/compare-page-natural-titanium-15promax-16pro.png">使它看起来好像</a>今年的天然钛显着比去年轻，但这是我的照片，我的照片<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/natural-titanium-15promax-16pro.jpeg">显示了自然的15 Pro Max和16个专业人士</a>。）沙漠钛有更多的黄金比棕褐色，但是有一些棕色，而没有将其像<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-17-gone-too-zune.html">Zune</a>一样。</p><p>简而言之，常规iPhone 16提供了一些真正弹出的颜色。 iPhone 16 Pro型号与所有以前的“ Pro” iPhone配色一样，仍然是灰色的阴影。白色灰色，灰色灰色，近黑色的灰色，现在是沙漠灰色。</p><p>我总是购买黑色，或者最接近黑色苹果公司的报价，而<a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/2243900364">我在2009年写的这条推文</a>仍然是正确的，所以我唯一拥有“购买哪种颜色？”的一年。个人困境是2016年的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2016/09/the_iphones_7">iPhone 7</a> ，苹果公司在哑光的“黑色”和类似Vader的光泽“ Jet Black”中提供了iPhone 7。 <sup id="fnr6-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn6-2024-09-18">6</a></sup>我仍然不敢相信苹果在同一模型中提供了两个完全不同的黑人。</p><p>但是“要购买哪种型号？”有时确实是您的困境。在2020年，我购买了普通的iPhone 12，而不是12个Pro，理由是它的重量较小，并且在手上感觉更好。我正确地猜到，什么非Pro iPhone 12缺乏摄影功能并不重要，而在Covid流行期间，我仍然仍然是家里。但是，12 Mini也很诱人，事后看来，我真的不记得为什么这不是我那年购买的模型。</p><p>当常规iPhone型号甚至对Power用户非常吸引人时，这是一件好事，也是Apple的力量。例如，去年似乎是一个人工限制，只有15个Pro模型才获得新的动作按钮。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/the_iphones_14_pro">前一年</a>，只有14个专业模特才获得了动态岛。常规的iPhone 14型号被无效的档位粘住。如果您对TSMC的第一代3NM制造非常深入杂草，那么为什么只有iPhone 15 Pro模型才能获得新的芯片（A17 Pro，没有常规A17），而iPhone 15型号则保持一岁的A16，但仍然很沮丧。今年，常规的16和16 Plus不仅获得了动作按钮，而且还获得了新的摄像头控制（正如我上面所说的那样，它比去年的动作按钮更有意义）以及用TSMC的第二代3NM工艺制造的新的A18芯片。</p><p>为了自己使用，我已经预订了iPhone 16 Pro。但是自2020年上述iPhone 12以来，这是常规iPhone 16的真正吸引。16和16个Pro模型之间的最大功能差异是，只有16名优点拥有第三个远摄镜头。去年，15个Pro Max达到5倍，但15个Pro以3倍的速度保留。今年，16个Pro和16个Pro Max具有5×远摄镜头。我倾向于认为我很少使用远摄镜头，但是事实证明，我在去年使用的镜头比我想象的要多一点。使用<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/10/find-photos-taken-by-specific-iphone-lenses/">照片中的智能专辑按相机和镜头对图像进行排序</a>，看来我用iPhone 15 Pro拍摄的3,890张照片中，相机镜头的崩溃是这样的： </p><table class="table-D56FDA37-00BC-4F1C-B45E-7FFB0AD7DB67" style = "width: 450px; margin-left: 0px;"><style>

Whether that&#39;s actually an advantage for the Pro models depends on whether you care that they&#39;re also slightly taller and heavier devices in hand.</p><h2>电池寿命</h2><p>I omitted from the above comparison the one spec people care most about: battery life. Here is the sleeper spec where the Pro models earn their keep. Once again grouping like-vs.-like size classes, and including the 15 Pro models for year-over-year comparison: </p><table class="table-39A473DB-0BE5-4EF1-840E-BB1D42074C9B" style = "width: 400px; margin-left: 0px;"><style>

But those numbers suggest 20 percent longer battery life on the 16 Pro models compared to their size-class non-pro counterparts. Anecdotally, that feels true to me. I use a Shortcuts automation to turn on Low Power mode whenever my iPhone battery level drops below 35 percent. With my iPhone 15 Pro, that generally happens every night at some point. Over the last week using the iPhone 16 Pro as my primary iPhone, it hasn&#39;t dropped that low most nights. To say the least, that&#39;s not a rigorous test in any way, shape, or form. But Apple has no history of exaggerating battery life claims, especially relative comparisons between devices. I think it&#39;s the real deal, and the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max probably get 20 percent longer battery life than their corresponding 16 and 16 Plus counterparts, and between 10–15 percent over last year&#39;s Pro models, in practical day-to-day使用。</p><p> That alone might be worth a big chunk of the $200 price difference to some people.</p><h2>苹果情报</h2><p>I spent the weekdays last week running iOS 18.0; on Friday afternoon, I upgraded my 16 Pro review unit to the developer beta of iOS 18.1 (beta 3 at the time, since upgraded to beta 4). I&#39;m sure many, if not most reviewers, will review only what comes in the box, and what&#39;s coming in the box this week will be iOS 18.0 without any Apple Intelligence features.</p><p> That stance is fair enough, but I don&#39;t see it as a big deal to include my 18.1 experience in this review. iOS 18.1 feels pretty close to shipping. Apple has promised “October”, and my gut feeling, using it for the last five days on this review unit, is that it&#39;s pretty solid. I suspect it might ship closer to early October than late October. But even if it doesn&#39;t appear until Halloween, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s absurd or offensive that Apple is already using Apple Intelligence to market the iPhone 16 lineup. It&#39;s a little awkward right now, but it&#39;s not a sham. It&#39;s vaporware until it actually ships, but it&#39;s vaporware that anyone with a developer account can install right now.</p><p> Also, none of the Apple Intelligence features currently in iOS 18.1 are game-changing. The Clean Up feature in Photos is pretty good, and when it doesn&#39;t produce good results, you can simply revert to the original. The AI-generated summaries of messages, notifications, and emails in Mail are at times apt, but <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cabel@panic.com/113106326493290583">at others not so much</a> . I haven&#39;t tried the Rewrite tool because I&#39;m, let&#39;s face it, pretty confident in my own writing ability. But, after my own final editing pass, I ran this entire review through the Proofread feature, and it correctly flagged seven mistakes I missed, and an eighth that I had marked, but had forgotten to fix. Most of its suggestions that I have chosen to ignore were, by the book, legitimate. (Eg, it suggested replacing the jargon-y <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/magazine/on-language-hed-folo-my-lede-unhed.html">lede</a></em> with the standard spelling <em>lead</em> . It also flagged my stubborn capitalization of “MacOS”.) It took 1 minute, 45 seconds to complete the proofreading pass of the 7,200+ words in Apple Notes on the iPhone 16 Pro. (Subsequent to the original publication of this review, I tried the Rewrite function on the text of it, for shits and giggles, and the only way I can describe the results is that it gave up.)</p><p> New Siri definitely offers a cooler-looking visual interface. And the new Siri voices sound more natural. But it also feels like Siri is speaking too slowly, as though Siri hails from the Midwest or something. (Changing Siri&#39;s speaking rate to 110 percent in Settings → Accessibility → Siri sounds much more natural to my ears, and feels like it matches old Siri&#39;s speaking rate.) Type to Siri is definitely cool, but I don&#39;t see why we couldn&#39;t have had that feature since 2010. I have actually used the new “Product Knowledge” feature, where Siri draws upon knowledge from Apple&#39;s own support documentation, while writing this review.这很棒。 But maybe Apple&#39;s support website should have had better search years ago?</p><p> These are all good features. But let&#39;s say you never heard of LLMs or ChatGPT. And instead, at WWDC this year, without any overarching “Apple Intelligence” marketing umbrella, Apple had simply announced features like a new cool-looking Siri interface, typing rather than talking to Siri, being able to remove unwanted background objects from photos, a “proofreading” feature for the standard text system that extends and improves the years-old but (IMO) kinda lame grammar-checking feature on MacOS, and brings it to iOS too? Those would seem like totally normal features Apple might add this year. But not tentpole features. These Apple Intelligence features strike me as nothing more than the sort of nice little improvements Apple makes across its OSes every year.</p><p> Apple reiterated throughout last week&#39;s “It&#39;s Glowtime” keynote, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-iphone-16-pro-apple-intelligence-ads/">now in its advertising for the iPhone 16 lineup</a> , that these are the first iPhones “built for Apple Intelligence from the ground up”. I&#39;m not buying that. These are simply the <em>second</em> generation of iPhone models with enough RAM to run on-device LLMs. LLMs are breakthrough technology. But they&#39;re breakthroughs at the implementation level. The technology is fascinating and important, but so are things like the Swift programming language. I spent the first half of my time testing the iPhone 16 Pro running iOS 18.0 and the second half running 18.1 with Apple Intelligence. A few things got a little nicer.就是这样。</p><p> I might be underselling how impossible the Clean Up feature would be without generative AI. I am very likely underselling how valuable the new writing tools might prove to people trying to write in a second language, or who simply aren&#39;t capable of expressing themselves well in their first language. But like I said, they&#39;re all good features. I just don&#39;t see them as combining to form the collective tentpole that Apple is marketing “Apple Intelligence” as. I get it that from Apple&#39;s perspective, engineering-wise, it&#39;s like adding an entire platform to the existing OS. It&#39;s a massive engineering effort and the on-device execution constraints are onerous. But from a user&#39;s perspective, they&#39;re just ... features. When&#39;s the last year Apple has not added cool new features along the scope of these?</p><p> Apple&#39;s just riding — and now, through the impressive might of its own advertising and marketing, contributing to — the AI hype wave, and I find that a little eye-roll inducing. It would have been cooler, in an understated breathe-on-your-fingernails-and-polish-them-on-your-shirt kind of way, if Apple had simply added these same new features across their OSes without the marketing emphasis being on the “Apple Intelligence” umbrella. If not for the AI hype wave the industry is currently caught in, this emphasis on which features are part of “Apple Intelligence” would seem as strange as Apple emphasizing, in advertisements, which apps are now built using SwiftUI.</p><p> If the iPhone 16 lineup was “built from the ground up” with a purpose in mind, it&#39;s to serve as the best prosumer cameras ever made. Not to create <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/12/apple-intelligence-generated-image-craig-dog/">cartoon images of a dog blowing out candles on a birthday cake</a> . The new lineup of iPhones 16 are amazing devices. The non-pro iPhone 16 and 16 Plus arguably offer the best value-per-dollar of any iPhones Apple has ever made. This emphasis on Apple Intelligence distracts from that.</p><p> The problem isn&#39;t that Apple is marketing Apple Intelligence a few weeks before it&#39;s actually going to ship. It&#39;s that few of these features are among the coolest or most interesting things about the new iPhone 16 lineup, and none are unique advantages that only Apple has the ability or inclination to offer. <sup id="fnr7-2024-09-18"><a href="#fn7-2024-09-18">7</a></sup> Every phone on the market will soon be able to generate impersonal saccharine passages of text and uncanny-valley images via LLMs. Only Apple has the talent and passion to create something as innovative and genuinely useful as Camera Control.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2024-09-18"><p> While I&#39;m reminiscing, allow me to reiterate my belief that the icon on the iPhone Home button is the single greatest icon ever designed.

[...]</p><p> I find it hard to consider a world where that button was marked by an icon that looked like a house (the overwhelmingly common choice for a “home” icon) or printed with the word “ <span class="caps">HOME</span> ” (the way iPods <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ipod+menu+button&amp;t=hg&amp;ia=images">had a “ <span class="caps">MENU</span> ”按钮</a>）。 Early iPhone prototypes did, in fact, <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/488008/jony-ive-book-excerpt-iphone/">have a “ <span class="caps">MENU</span> ” label on the button</a> .</p><p> I truly consider the iPhone Home button icon the single best icon ever.

<p>Allison Johnson, The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Intelligence&#39;s list of forthcoming supported languages just got a little longer. After an October launch in US English, Apple says its AI feature set will be available in German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Vietnamese, “and others” in the coming year. The company drops this news just days before the iPhone 16&#39;s arrival — the phone built for AI that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241043/apple-iphone-16-pro-intelligence-ai-missing">won&#39;t have any AI features at launch</a> .</p><p> Apple&#39;s AI feature set will expand to include localized English in the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand in December, with India and Singapore joining the mix next year. The company <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-intelligence-comes-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-starting-next-month/">already announced plans</a> to support Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish next year as well.</p></blockquote><p> Apple shared this news with me last night too, and my first thought was, “German and Italian? Does that mean they&#39;ve gotten the OK that Apple Intelligence is, in fact, compliant with the DMA?” But that&#39;s not what they&#39;re announcing. This is just for Apple Intelligence <em>on the Mac</em> — which already offers Apple Intelligence in the EU in MacOS 15.1 Sequoia betas, because the Mac is not a designated “gatekeeping” platform.

<p>Sheera Frenkel and Ronen Bergman, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Israel carried out its operation against Hezbollah on Tuesday by hiding explosive material within a new batch of Taiwanese-made pagers imported into Lebanon, according to American and other officials briefed on the operation.</p><p> The pagers, which Hezbollah had ordered from Gold Apollo in Taiwan, had been tampered with before they reached Lebanon, according to some of the officials. Most were the company&#39;s AP924 model, though three other Gold Apollo models were also included in the shipment.</p><p> The explosive material, as little as one to two ounces, was implanted next to the battery in each pager, two of the officials said. A switch was also embedded that could be triggered remotely to detonate the explosives.</p><p> At 3:30 pm in Lebanon, the pagers received a message that appeared as though it was coming from Hezbollah&#39;s leadership, two of the officials said. Instead, the message activated the explosives. Lebanon&#39;s health minister told state media at least nine people were killed and more than 2,800 injured.</p><p> The devices were programmed to beep for several seconds before exploding, according to three of the officials.</p></blockquote><p> Hezbollah leadership had ordered its members to forgo modern phones for security reasons, convinced (probably correctly) that Israeli intelligence was able to track them. So they switched to decades-old pagers. But Israel seemingly infiltrated the supply chain of Gold Apollo and boobytrapped the pagers.</p><p> In the initial pandemonium after the attack was triggered, there was speculation that, somehow, it was simply the batteries that exploded. But batteries — especially the AAA batteries these pagers use — don&#39;t explode with that much force:</p><blockquote><p> Independent cybersecurity experts who have studied footage of the attacks said it was clear that the strength and speed of the explosions were caused by a type of explosive material.</p><p> “These pagers were likely modified in some way to cause these types of explosions — the size and strength of the explosion indicates it was not just the battery,” said Mikko Hypponen, a research specialist at the software company WithSecure and a cybercrime adviser to Europol 。</p></blockquote><p> This whole operation sounds like it would make for a great movie.</p><p> (Hypponen, whom I believe I met, at least once, at a long-ago Macworld Expo or WWDC, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/08/flashback-need-to-know">was previously referenced on DF in 2012</a> regarding a widespread Mac Trojan horse.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Israel Planted Explosives in Pagers Sold to Hezbollah, Officials Say’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/17/israel-hezbollah-explosive-pagers">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://workos.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=q12024" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vra" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2024/09/workos_14" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/feeds/sponsors//11.41158</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2024-09-16T23:02:21Z</published><updated> 2024-09-16T23:02:22Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<h2>Thoughts and Observations in the Wake of Apple&#39;s &#39;It&#39;s Glowtime&#39; Keynote</h2><p> Back in July 2007, I contributed <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/897513389/">this photo</a> to a Flickr group called, self-describingly, “The Items We Carry”:</p><p> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/897513389/"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/items-i-carried-2007.jpeg"
    alt="A top-down view of the following items, arranged neatly on a wooden tabletop: a small Leatherman pocketknife/multi-tool, a keyring with four keys, a small leather wallet, a Ricoh GR-D digital camera, cheap black aviator sunglasses, a 0.5 mm Pilot G2 pen, a black pocket-sized hardcover Moleskine notebook, a black Swiss Army wristwatch, and an original iPhone."
    width = 525
/></a></p><p> 17 years later, I&#39;ve consolidated. 2007 was so long ago that <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> hadn&#39;t yet been created; my back-pocket notebooks are much slimmer now than that hardcover Moleskine. <sup id="fnr1-2024-09-16"><a href="#fn1-2024-09-16">1</a></sup> Instead of the Leatherman and a ring of four keys, I&#39;m down to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/keys-and-halifax.jpeg">just two keys</a> and a <a href="https://thejamesbrand.com/products/the-halifax?variant=12247075717221">Halifax key-sized tool</a> from The James Brand. The keys and Halifax lay flat and fit comfortably in the change pocket of a pair of jeans. <sup id="fnr2-2024-09-16"><a href="#fn2-2024-09-16">2</a></sup> And while I do own (and <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/2pHzJvwMB7gIIAp9LJLPfY">very</a> <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/4qBs4smgzRR16aKseVvdKI">much</a> <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/5Ejg9517dwGY99m4Q2KN27">enjoy</a> ) a Ricoh GR IIIx — a modern but very similarly sized descendant of the above camera — I don&#39;t carry it on an everyday basis because iPhone cameras have gotten so good.</p><p> But there was an everyday carry item I omitted from the above photo — wired earbuds. I don&#39;t remember if I omitted them because I forgot to include them, or if it was for aesthetic reasons. But circa 2007 I generally had a pair of wired Apple earbuds with me. Today, I&#39;ve always got my AirPods Pro — far and away my favorite consolidation. By weight, AirPods (with case) are heavier, but measured by fussiness, they offer a never-tangled fraction of the wired earbuds experience.</p><p> The remaining items in my pockets are equivalent but upgraded. I&#39;ve got better (and because I no longer wear contact lenses, prescription) sunglasses. I long ago switched from the Pilot G2 to the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/6387">Zebra Sarasa</a> , a pen I consider nearly perfect. The above Swiss Army watch broke in early 2009, and I&#39;ve since started a small (I swear) collection of mechanical watches. But on most workdays, there&#39;s an Apple Watch on my wrist.</p><p> iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch. I&#39;ve <em>almost always</em> got two of them with me, and often all three. I&#39;m sure for many of you reading this, it&#39;s always all three.</p><p> These are Apple&#39;s three “everyday carry” products. They&#39;re as much a part of our lives as our clothes and glasses and jewelry. They thus go together swimmingly in the same product introduction event.</p><p> Last week&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarNiSl_uh4">“It&#39;s Glowtime” event</a> was very strong for Apple. It might have been the single strongest iPhone event since the introduction of the iPhone X. All three platforms are now in excellent, appealing, and coherent shape:</p><ul><li><p> <strong>iPhone:</strong> Last year was a bit “meh” for the non-pro iPhone 15 models, which were stuck with year-old A16 silicon and didn&#39;t get the new hardware Action button. This year, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus get the brand-new A18 chip, the Action button, <em>and</em> the new Camera Control button. That Camera Control button would have made total sense as a Pro-exclusive feature this year (more sense, to me, than making the Action button Pro-exclusive last year) but all new iPhones have it. This year&#39;s iPhone 16 and 16 Plus even come in the best and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mleo_iphone_store/post/C_9_csWgUhn">most fun colors in a few years</a> . The iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have best-in-class camera systems, the A18 Pro chip (6 GPUs vs. 5 in the regular A18, bigger CPU caches, faster memory and storage I/O), and slightly bigger screens. <sup id="fnr3-2024-09-16"><a href="#fn3-2024-09-16">3</a></sup> The iPhone remains the best product in the most important and profitable device category the world has ever seen.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Apple Watch:</strong> The new Series 10 models sport bigger displays, longer battery life, and 10 percent reductions in thickness and weight. The new watch displays are slightly bigger, and, more importantly, also have noticeably wider viewing angles, and in always-on mode update once per second instead of once per minute. There&#39;s an absolutely gorgeous polished jet black option in aluminum — marking, to my taste, the first time in the entire history of Apple Watch that there&#39;s a base-priced aluminum model that stands toe-to-toe with the more expensive models on aesthetic grounds 。 But those more expensive models are better than ever too, with Apple replacing polished stainless steel with much lighter polished titanium. I was unaware that titanium could be polished to a mirror-like sheen. Apple had previously made Series models of Apple Watch in titanium — I bought one in Series 5 and again in Series 7 — but those were at the Edition tier, priced above the stainless steel models. There was no Ultra 3 announcement — the lone sour note in the Watch segment — but the Ultra 2 is now available in an excellent and sure-to-be-popular <a href="https://www.ablogtowatch.com/hands-on-debut-apple-watch-ultra-2-black-dlc-titanium-smartwatch/">satin black DLC coating</a> .</p></li><li><p> <strong>AirPods:</strong> No more selling years-old models at entry-level prices. The new good/better/best lineup is clear. <em>Good:</em> new AirPods 4 for $129. <em>Better:</em> AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a better case (with wireless charging and Find My support, including a speaker) for $179. <em>Best:</em> the existing $249 AirPods Pro, which, yes, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/thoughts_and_observations_on_last_weeks_far_out_apple_event">debuted two years ago</a> , but which continue to be updated with improved functionality via firmware updates — most notably and importantly now, certified support for use as hearing aids. There&#39;s also the revised AirPods Max, with new colors and USB-C replacing Lightning, but alas, no significant internal updates like the H2 chip now available in all other AirPod models, which powers features like voice isolation and nod/shake-your-head Siri interactions or lossless audio support. That&#39;s a slightly sour note, but on the whole, the AirPods lineup looks (and sounds) better than ever.</p></li></ul><hr /><p> But, still, flying home from California on Tuesday, I was left with a feeling best described as ennui. On Threads, I summarized my feelings <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/C_v0eq6vZ3a">with one short sentence</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The obvious truth is that we all, including Apple, miss Steve Jobs.</p></blockquote><p> Quoting me, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mossbergwalt/post/C_v_Ed0PHJ3">Walt Mossberg responded</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This👇.绝对正确。 The post-Steve Jobs Apple has been a phenomenal money-making machine and has had a few notable product successes like AirPods and the Apple Watch. But it hasn&#39;t replicated the big game changer product experience of the Jobs era.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been pondering this for the remainder of the week. One factor is that the iPhone defined the apex of personal computing. In the early years of PCs, everyone knew we wanted portability. Most of us — including me — thought we reached that with laptops. But laptops don&#39;t go with us everywhere, and, it turns out, we want computers that go with us everywhere. That&#39;s the iPhone, and the original iPhone in 2007 established the all-touch-screen form factor and general concept right out of the gate. That first iPhone blew our minds the moment Steve Jobs showed it to us.</p><p> Eventually, some company will introduce such a product again. It might be Apple. If it happens any time soon or soon-ish, it probably will be Apple. Apple, as a company, has a long-term strategy that it hopes will make it as likely as possible that it will be Apple. But there&#39;s been no such product since the iPhone and, in my opinion, there is no technology extant today that would enable such a product. I feel confident that if Steve Jobs were alive and still leading Apple product development, there would have been no iPhone-like mind-blown-the-moment-you-first-saw-it new product in the intervening years.</p><p> Mossberg correctly cites AirPods and Apple Watches as big successes of the post-Jobs era. Not coincidentally, they are two of the three platforms Apple featured in last week&#39;s event — and two of the three that people carry wherever they go. But we don&#39;t really <em>carry</em> AirPods and Apple Watch — we <em>wear</em> them. They&#39;re not more important than our iPhones, but they are more intimate, more personal.</p><p> But they&#39;re also more subtle. When AirPods debuted many people thought they looked weird to wear. When Apple Watch debuted people were underwhelmed. But it turns out, perhaps even more so than with the iPhone, Apple nailed the design with both products right out of the gate. Apple Watch has an iconic, instantly recognizable form factor, but from a distance of more than a few feet away, it&#39;d be hard to tell a brand-new Series 10 from 2015&#39;s original “Series 0” models. The original watch straps remain compatible with the newest models — including even the Ultras. With AirPods, the stems have gotten noticeably shorter, but on the whole, they&#39;re the exact same basic concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods">as the original models from 2016</a> . They&#39;re even offered in the exact same array of colors: white, white, or white.</p><p> What we&#39;re seeing is Tim Cook&#39;s Apple. Cook is a strong, sage leader, and the proof is that the entire company is now ever more in his image.这是不可避免的。 It&#39;s also not at all to say Apple is worse off. In <em>some</em> ways it is, but in others, Apple is far better. I can&#39;t prove any of this, of course, but my gut says that a Steve-Jobs–led Apple today would be noticeably less financially successful and industry-dominating than the actual Tim-Cook–led Apple has been.</p><p> I think Apple Watch, under Jobs, would have been more like iPod was or AirPods have been: a product entirely defined by Apple, not a platform for third-party developers. (Jobs was famously reluctant to even make iPhone a platform.)</p><p> But the biggest difference is that Apple, under Jobs, was <em>quirky</em> , and I think would have remained noticeably more quirky than it has been under Cook. You&#39;d be wrong, I say, to argue that Cook has drained the fun out of Apple. But I do think he&#39;s eliminated quirkiness. Cook&#39;s Apple takes too few risks. Jobs&#39;s Apple took too many risks.</p><p> Tim Cook is no mere bean counter.远非如此。 He shares with Jobs a driving ambition to change the world. Cook, just like Jobs, surely relates deeply to this quip from Walt Disney: “We don&#39;t make movies to make money. We make money to make more movies.” But the ways Cook is driven to change the world are different.</p><p> Jobs often wore his heart on his shirtsleeve, not merely in public but on stage. Remember the 2010 WWDC keynote, when Jobs had an iPhone demo fail because the Wi-Fi wasn&#39;t working, and 20 minutes later he came back on stage and angrily demanded that the media turn off their portable Wi-Fi base stations being used for live-blogging the keynote? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6cIeZmFdPs">He was fucking angry</a> and he let us know it. You simply didn&#39;t mess with a Steve Jobs keynote.</p><p> Cook almost <em>never</em> reveals his true passionate self in public. But at least one time he did. At the 2014 annual shareholders meeting, Cook faced a question from a representative of the right-wing National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/tim-cook-rejects-ncppr-politics/">As reported by Bryan Chaffin at The Mac Observer</a> :</p><blockquote><p> During the question and answer session, however, the NCPPR representative asked Mr. Cook two questions, both of which were in line with the principles espoused in the group&#39;s proposal. The first question challenged an assertion from Mr. Cook that Apple&#39;s sustainability programs and goals — Apple plans on having 100 percent of its power come from green sources — are good for the bottom line.</p><p> The representative asked Mr. Cook if that was the case only because of government subsidies on green energy. Mr. Cook didn&#39;t directly answer that question, but instead focused on the second question: the NCPPR representative asked Mr. Cook to commit right then and there to doing only those things that were profitable.</p><p> What ensued was the only time I can recall seeing Tim Cook angry, and he categorically rejected the worldview behind the NCPPR&#39;s advocacy. He said that there are many things Apple does because they are right and just, and that a return on investment (ROI) was not the primary consideration on such issues.</p><p> “When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind,” he said, “I don&#39;t consider the bloody ROI.” He said the same thing about environmental issues, worker safety, and other areas where Apple is a leader.</p><p> As evidenced by the use of “bloody” in his response — the closest thing to public profanity I&#39;ve ever seen from Mr. Cook — it was clear that he was quite angry. His body language changed, his face contracted, and he spoke in rapid fire sentences compared to the usual metered and controlled way he speaks.</p><p> He didn&#39;t stop there, however, as he looked directly at the NCPPR representative and said, “If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock.”</p></blockquote><p> A philosophy of “Whatever is best for the ROI” is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/corporate-purpose/from-there-to-here-50-years-of-thinking-on-the-social-responsibility-of-business">McKinsey-flavored</a> cowardice, not leadership. Sometimes a leader needs to make decisions with uncertain business sense, or even knowing that the decision <em>doesn&#39;t</em> make business sense, but simply because their intuition or conscience tell them it&#39;s the right thing to do. Insofar as he&#39;s willing to make such decisions, Cook is like Jobs. But what sort of decisions those are, are very different.</p><p> Jobs was driven to improve the way computers work. Cook is driven to improve the way humans live. Accessibility and the environment are much higher priorities under Cook than they were under Jobs. Apple&#39;s entire foray into Health has occurred under Cook&#39;s leadership — and Health-related features were tentpole features in last week&#39;s keynote. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it cost far more money to get AirPods Pro certified as medical-grade hearing aids than Apple will make back in profits from an increase in sales. <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">The Apple 2030 initiative</a> to bring the company&#39;s entire carbon footprint to net zero emissions is fundamentally about doing the right thing, not just selling more products.</p><p> Jobs emphasized making more interesting products, and maximizing surprise and delight upon their unveilings. Tim Cook wouldn&#39;t have <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cops-raid-gizmodo-editors-home-over-lost-iphone-raise-questions-of-legal-search-upon-journalist/">sent the police after Gizmodo&#39;s purloined iPhone 4 prototype</a> ; Steve Jobs probably thought Apple took it easy on them.</p><p> Cook values predictability. But predictability is in conflict with quirkiness. You don&#39;t need to even recognize Mark Gurman&#39;s name to have predicted that last week&#39;s event would focus on new iPhones, new AirPods, and new Apple Watches. Nor do you need to follow the rumor mill to have correctly guessed that all of those new products would look very similar to the models that preceded them. Evolve, evolve, evolve. There&#39;s no resting on laurels inside Apple with any of those products. The iPhones 16, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 are all the result of intensely-focused industry-leading engineering (including in fields like material engineering) and design. But they also all basically look exactly like all of us expected them to look.</p><p> Remember <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/187310/3gipodnano.html">the 3rd-gen iPod Nano</a> in 2007? Aka “ <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-3rd-generation-fat-nano-specs.html">the fat Nano</a> ”: </p><p><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/fat-nano.jpeg"
    alt="Marketing photo of five 3rd-gen “fat” iPod Nanos, blue, red, silver, green, and black."
/></p><p> It&#39;s quite possible you <em>don&#39;t</em> remember the fat Nano, because it wasn&#39;t insanely great, even though it replaced 2nd-gen iPod Nano models that were. And so a year later, with <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/IPod_nano_(4th_generation)">the 4th-gen Nanos</a> , Apple went back to the tall-and-skinny design, as though the fat Nano had never happened.</p><p> That fat Nano was quirky. It was also, in hindsight, obviously a mistake. I&#39;m quite sure that inside Apple there were designers and product people who thought it was a mistake before it shipped. Steve Jobs shipped it anyway, surely because his gut told him it was the right thing to try. Tim Cook&#39;s Apple doesn&#39;t make mistakes like that. That&#39;s ultimately why Cook&#39;s Apple is more successful — with more customers, more revenue, higher margins (and thus more profit), and more, well, sheer dominance (and, thus, more regulatory scrutiny). But it&#39;s also why Cook&#39;s Apple delivers fewer surprises. The delight is still there, but there&#39;s less amazement.这是设计使然。 They&#39;re not trying but failing to reach the heights of the Jobs era&#39;s ecstatic design novelty, because those peaks had accompanying valleys. Apple today is aiming for, and achieving, utterly consistent excellence. Quirkiness no longer fits.</p><p> The <a href="https://www.imore.com/imac-g4-form-meet-function">lampshade iMac G4</a> . The <a href="https://512pixels.net/2017/01/video-the-power-mac-g4-cube/">G4 Cube</a> . Peripherals like <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/07/the-isight-camera/">the iSight camera</a> — a product that was never intended to sell in massive numbers, but belongs in a museum alongside the best designs from Dieter Rams&#39;s Braun. <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/06/early-2001-imac-g3-psychedelic/">Flower Power and Dalmatian iMacs</a> . Under Jobs, Apple made many products that were memorable at each, or at least every other, revised generation. But sometimes — like the fat Nano — they were memorable for being duds. Under Cook, Apple produces instantly iconic designs that tend only to evolve — in mostly predictable ways, on mostly predictable schedules. <sup id="fnr4-2024-09-16"><a href="#fn4-2024-09-16">4</a></sup></p><p> Tim Cook&#39;s Apple has not missed any fundamental new technology or shift that would have resulted in industry-changing new products or platforms that, if he&#39;d lived, Steve Jobs would have led Apple to create through his singular genius or sheer force of will. But I also don&#39;t think we&#39;d have been left with new iPhones 16 that look like last year&#39;s iPhones 15, which looked like the iPhones 14, which looked like the iPhones 13, which looked like the iPhones 12, which looked like the iPhones 11 except that year the side rails went from rounded back to flat, like the iPhone 4 and 5 models. I can show you an iPhone 4 and you&#39;ll know, instantly, that it is either an iPhone 4 or 4S. I can show you an iPhone 5 and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s either an iPhone 5 or 5S (or <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2016/03/the_iphone_se">the first iPhone SE</a> ). If it were a black-and-slate <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2012/09/iphone_5">iPhone 5</a> you might even know it&#39;s a 5 specifically, not a 5S, because the anodization of the black iPhone 5 wore off over time, producing a weathered look — a patina — that I found endearing <a href="https://kitbashed.com/blog/a-complete-history-of-the-millennium-falcon">in an evocative way</a> no subsequent iPhone has. It was an imperfection, but sometimes imperfections are what we love most about products. <sup id="fnr5-2024-09-16"><a href="#fn5-2024-09-16">5</a></sup> Show me an iPhone from 2020–2024 a decade from now and I&#39;ll have to remember exactly when the Action button and Camera Control appeared to know which was which.</p><p> Cook has patience where Jobs would grow restless. In the Jobs era, when a keynote ended, we&#39;d sometimes turn to each other and say, “Can you believe ____?” No one asked that after last week&#39;s keynote. Much of what Apple announced was impressive. Very little was disappointing. Nothing was hard to believe or surprising.</p><p> This isn&#39;t bad for Apple, or a sign of institutional decline. If anything, under Cook, Apple more consistently achieves near-perfection. Tolerances are tighter. Ship dates seldom slip. But it&#39;s a change that makes the company less fun to keenly observe and obsess over. Cook&#39;s Apple is not overly cautious, but it&#39;s never reckless. Jobs&#39;s Apple was occasionally reckless, for <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/08/04/phil-schillers-greatest-stunt/">better</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2007/2007-70.htm">worse</a> .</p><p> My dissatisfaction flying home from last week&#39;s event is, ultimately, selfish. I miss having my mind blown. I miss being utterly surprised. I miss occasionally being disappointed by a product design that stretched <em>quirky</em> all the way to <em>wacky</em> . I miss being amazed by something entirely unexpected out of left field. Poor me, stuck only with the announcement of noticeably improved versions of three products — three product <em>families</em> — that zillions of people around the world, myself included, carry with us wherever we go.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2024-09-16"><p> Moleskine has long made thin, vaguely Field-Notes-y “ <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/journals/cahier-journals/cahier-journals-black-8055002851466.html">Cahier</a> ” notebooks, but they suck.

The differences between those two keynote formats — live stage events vs. pre-filmed movies — are a good proxy for the changes to Apple as a whole. Apple&#39;s modern pre-filmed keynotes are better for the company and better for most people who want to watch them. (Viewership numbers, I am reliably told, are higher than ever — and today dwarf the viewership of Jobs-era keynotes.) They&#39;re far more interesting visually and more information-dense. (No need to wait for new presenters to walk on stage and then off again. Just cut to a new scene.) They&#39;re more expensive to produce but the results are 100 percent predictable. No Apple keynote demo will ever fail again. But they&#39;re also less exciting. Demo fails are fun (from the audience, not from the stage) and — as noted above, w/r/t the Wi-Fi at WWDC 2010 — memorable. And the possibility that any live demo <em>might</em> fail adds a degree of palpable tension to every demo, even the ones that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3VoWgPsB8U">wind up going off without a hitch</a> . It&#39;s like the difference between watching a live motorcycle stunt show and a <em>Fast and Furious</em> movie. The movie looks better, but carries no sense of actual danger. <a href="#fnr4-2024-09-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn5-2024-09-16"><p> Or people. <a href="#fnr5-2024-09-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The Things They Carried</title></entry><entry><title> Thierry Breton Resigns, Forced Out by the European Commission President </title><link href="https://x.com/thierrybreton/status/1835565206639972734?s=46" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vr6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/16/breton-resigns" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.41154</id><published> 2024-09-16T16:15:04Z</published><updated> 2024-09-16T19:24:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Thierry Breton, in a letter to Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission:</p><blockquote><p> On 24 July, you wrote to Member States asking them to nominate candidates for the 2024-2029 College of Commissioner, specifying that Member States that intend to suggest the incumbent Member of the Commission were not required to suggest two candidates. On 25 July, President Emmanuel Macron designated me as France&#39;s official candidate for a second mandate in the College of Commissioners — as he had already publicly announced on the margins of the European Council on 28 June. A few days ago, in the very final stretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College, you asked France to withdraw my name — for personal reasons that in no instance you have discussed directly with me — and offered, as a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio for France in the future College. You will now be proposed a different candidate.</p><p> Over the past five years, I have relentlessly striven to uphold and advance the common European good, above national and party interests. It has been an honour.</p><p> However, in light of these latest developments — further testimony to questionable governance — I have to conclude that I can no longer exercise my duties in the College.</p><p> I am therefore resigning from my position as European Commissioner, effective immediately.</p></blockquote><p> Translation from bureaucratese to English: “Faced with being fired <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/18/breton-jackass">for being a jackass</a> or resigning, I resign.”</p><p> I&#39;m starting to get the feeling that the EC&#39;s regulatory arm is not, in fact, politically popular in the EU.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Thierry Breton Resigns, Forced Out by the European Commission President’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/16/breton-resigns">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>蒂普托普</title><link href="http://www.tiptop.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vr5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/15/tiptop" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.41153</id><published> 2024-09-15T21:41:01Z</published><updated> 2024-09-15T21:41:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Kylie Robison, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> OpenAI 正在发布一个名为 o1 的新模型，这是计划中的一系列“推理”模型中的第一个模型，这些模型经过训练可以比人类更快地回答更复杂的问题。 It&#39;s being released alongside o1-mini, a smaller, cheaper version. And yes, if you&#39;re steeped in AI rumors: this is, in fact, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-details-on-openais-strawberry-apples-siri-makeover-larry-ellison-doubles-down-on-data-centers?rc=mshudk">the extremely hyped Strawberry</a> model.</p><p> For OpenAI, o1 represents a step toward its broader goal of human-like artificial intelligence. More practically, it does a better job at writing code and solving multistep problems than previous models. But it&#39;s also more expensive and slower to use than GPT-4o. OpenAI is calling this release of o1 a “preview” to emphasize how nascent it is. [...]</p><p> “The model is definitely better at solving the AP math test than I am, and I was a math minor in college,” OpenAI&#39;s chief research officer, Bob McGrew, tells me. He says OpenAI also tested o1 against a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad, and while GPT-4o only correctly solved only 13 percent of problems, o1 scored 83 percent.</p></blockquote><p> Putting aside the politics and other legitimate social and legal concerns around AI, scoring that well in a difficult math exam is just incredible.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Robison wrote:</p><blockquote><p> I wasn&#39;t able to demo o1 myself, but McGrew and Tworek showed it to me over a video call this week. They asked it to solve this puzzle:</p><blockquote><p> “A princess is as old as the prince will be when the princess is twice as old as the prince was when the princess&#39;s age was half the sum of their present age. What is the age of prince and princess? Provide all solutions to that question.”</p></blockquote><p> The model buffered for 30 seconds and then delivered a correct answer.</p></blockquote><p> I found this puzzle pretty damn tricky, personally. I pasted it, verbatim, into ChatGPT-4o and it solved it, correctly, the first time. I pasted it into the new o1-Preview model, and it both took longer <em>and</em> gave me the incorrect answer. I replied to o1-Preview, “Are you sure about that answer? Can you try it again?” and this time it gave me the correct answer. Still impressive, but kind of weird that this was OpenAI&#39;s own example puzzle intended to show off the new o1-Preview model.</p><p> <em>Spoilers follow. Avert your eyes from the remainder of the post if you want to solve this one your own.</em> Here&#39;s how I solved the puzzle, with pen and paper, before pasting the puzzle into any LLMs:</p><p> Let <em>y</em> = the princess&#39;s age now and <em>x</em> = the prince&#39;s. Let <em>d</em> = the delta between princess and prince&#39;s ages. By definition, at any given year in time, <code>d = y - x</code> and therefore <code>y = x + d</code> . (To be pedantic, <code>d</code> equals the absolute value of <code>y - x</code> but somehow it&#39;s obvious to me, from phrase “as the prince will be”, that the princess is older than the prince.)</p><p> We care about three years:</p><ol><li>现在。</li><li> When the princess is half the sum of their combined ages from year (1).</li><li> When the princess is twice the prince&#39;s age from year (2).</li></ol><p> For (1), we know by definition that this is always true now matter what year it is: <code>y = x + d</code> — that is to say the princess is <code>d</code> years older than the prince.</p><p> For (2) we can express the princess&#39;s age as:</p><pre> <code>(y + x) / 2</code></pre><p> And we from (1) we know that no matter what year it is, the prince is <code>d</code> years younger than the princess. So during year of (2), the prince&#39;s age can be expressed as:</p><pre> <code>((y + x) / 2) - d</code></pre><p> and year (3) is defined as when the princess ( <code>y</code> ) is twice the above (the prince&#39;s age from year (2)), so the princess age in year (3) can be expressed as:</p><pre> <code>2((y + x) / 2) - 2d</code></pre><p> And in any given year, the prince&#39;s age is the princess&#39;s minus <code>d</code> , which can thus be expressed, for year (3), by subtracting one more <code>d</code> from the line above:</p><pre> <code>2((y + x) / 2) - 3d</code></pre><p> Cancelling out those 2&#39;s:</p><pre> <code>y + x - 3d</code></pre><p> That is the prince&#39;s age for year (3). The puzzle&#39;s definition is that princess&#39;s age now ( <code>y</code> ) is the same as prince&#39;s in year (3), the line above. So we can form an equation:</p><pre> <code>y = y + x - 3d</code></pre><p> Those <code>y</code> &#39;s cancel out, so we are left with:</p><pre> <code>x = 3d</code></pre><p> And by definition <code>y</code> is always <code>x + d</code> (the prince&#39;s age plus their age difference), so:</p><pre> <code>y = 4d</code></pre><p> So for any given difference ( <code>d</code> ) in their ages, the prince must be 3 times <code>d</code> and the princess 4 times <code>d</code> :</p><p><table class="table-A204578C-E981-4CB4-8A6D-2443385FA8BC" width = 450><style>

<p>Brian Heater, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> The iPhone 16 took center stage at Apple&#39;s “It&#39;s Glowtime” event, but the most interesting tidbit came from a different line entirely.

<p>Taylor Swift, in a post late last night on Instagram:</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve done my research, and I&#39;ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it&#39;s much easier to vote early. I&#39;ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.</p><p> With love and hope,</p><p>泰勒·斯威夫特<br />Childless Cat Lady</p></blockquote><p> Given her almost unfathomable popularity, any endorsement is a big deal, period. But this was a <em>really</em> well-written statement. The emphasis on doing your own research about both candidates and making up your own mind is persuasive. For one, it appeals to anyone young who&#39;s leaning Trump but feeling squishy about it, and fancies themself an independent thinker. And it deflates any notion that she&#39;s telling her fans to vote for Kamala Harris just because she is.</p><p> Timing this endorsement for after the end of last night&#39;s debate <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mossbergwalt/post/C_xzlZEOTG-">seems strategic</a> too. If Harris had done poorly, it would have presented a course-correcting narrative. Or, as actually happened, if Harris handed Trump his dumb red hat, it would run up the score.</p><p> And signing off that way? <em>Chef&#39;s kiss</em> .</p><p> Social media nerd note: Swift posted this to Instagram, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-instagram-twitter-elon-musk-2024-9">and Instagram only</a> . In 2020, when endorsing Joe Biden, she posted both <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGDjbq-jhtK/?img_index=2">to Instagram</a> <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1313938080290803715">and Twitter</a> .

<p>Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> Apple today discontinued its ill-received FineWoven material, introducing no new cases that use the leather replacement.

<p>My thanks to 1Password — which, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/1password-acquires-kolide">acquired longtime DF sponsor Kolide</a> — for sponsoring last week at DF. When the EU enacted GDPR in 2018, executives and security professionals waited anxiously to see how the law would be enforced. And then they kept waiting ... and waiting ... but the Great European Privacy Crackdown never came.</p><p> But the days of betting that you&#39;re too big or too small to be noticed by GDPR are over. Recently, EU member nations (plus the UK) have started taking action against data controllers of all sizes–from the big (Amazon), to the medium (a trucking company), to the truly minuscule (a Spanish citizen whose home security cameras bothered their neighbors).</p><p> If you&#39;re an IT or security professional, you may be wondering what to do. Unfortunately, GDPR compliance isn&#39;t the kind of thing you can solve by buying a tool or scheduling a training session. The best place to start is to adopt a policy of data minimization: collect only the data you truly need to function, on both customers and employees. After that, your second priority should be securing the data you have — keeping it only as long as you absolutely need to, and then destroying it.</p><p> 1Password can help with all aspects of GDPR compliance.

<p>There&#39;s a scene in Martin Scorsese&#39;s <em>Casino</em> . Gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and two of his goon friends are in a nightclub in the Tangiers casino resort (a fictionalized version of the old Stardust), which is run by Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro). Santoro and Rothstein, who&#39;d been friends for decades, are now on the outs. The Tangiers is a front for the mafia and the Teamsters. Rothstein, a gambling genius who was born to run a casino, is earning major bank for the bosses back home. Santoro is gangstering up Las Vegas, and is under severe law enforcement scrutiny. They just held a contentious meeting, just the two of them, at Santoro&#39;s request, in the middle of the desert — a meeting Rothstein wasn&#39;t sure wouldn&#39;t conclude with him dead in a freshly dug hole in the sand.</p><p> Santoro and his two friends are just a threesome.都是男人。 Morose.</p><p> Rothstein comes in with Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) and a party of half a dozen or so men and women, including Oscar Goodman, famed defense attorney and future mayor of Las Vegas (playing himself), and several women. Everyone (but Rothstein, who&#39;s not much for fun) is laughing. You&#39;d be laughing too if you were out having drinks with Don Fucking Rickles and Oscar Goodman.</p><p> Santoro gripes about Rothstein not acknowledging him, and, well, makes some comments that suggest he doesn&#39;t hold Jews in the highest esteem. Santoro&#39;s right-hand man, Frank Marino (played by the great Frank Vincent, of Billy “Go Get Your Fucking Shine Box” Batts fame), dryly observes, “They&#39;re having a good time, too.”</p><p> The camera pulls back to show their threesome, alone in their booth, isolated. Santoro, who is absolutely not having a good time, replies, “So are we.”</p><p> I&#39;ve been thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezqy0v0qUig">that scene</a> a lot, lately.</p><p> Allison Johnson, in a piece for The Verge headlined “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/24/24226946/iphone-eu-regulation-app-stores-fortnite">European iPhones Are More Fun Now</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Whining about stuff is a treasured American pastime, so allow me to indulge: the iPhone is more fun in Europe now, and it&#39;s not fair.</p><p> They&#39;re getting all kinds of stuff because they have <em>cool</em> regulators, not, like, regular regulators. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games">Third-party app stores</a> , the ability for browsers to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">run their own engines</a> , <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">Fortnite</a> , and now the ability to<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24226110/apple-iphone-ipad-default-apps-eu-competition">replace lots of default apps</a> ? I want it, too! Imagine if Chrome on iOS wasn&#39;t just a rinky dink little Safari emulator!</p></blockquote><p> Imagine if Chrome could deplete your iPhone battery as fast as it does your MacBook battery. Imagine if you were one of the millions (zillions?) of people whose “incognito mode” browsing history was observed and stored by Google and deleted<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/01/1242019127/google-incognito-mode-settlement-search-history">only after they lost a lawsuit</a> . Imagine — and this takes a lot of imagination — if Google actually shipped a version of Chrome for iOS, only for the EU, that used its own battery-eating rendering engine instead of using the energy-efficient system version of WebKit.</p><blockquote><p> Imagine downloading a new dialer app with a soundboard of fart sounds and setting it as your default! Unfortunately, Apple doesn&#39;t seem interested in sharing these possibilities with everyone.</p></blockquote><p>听起来很有趣。</p><blockquote><p> Sure, we&#39;ve got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">retro game emulators in the app store</a> . And that rules. But that&#39;s only because Apple was worried everyone in the EU was about to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100464/altstore-pal-dma-eu-launch-delta-nintendo-emulator-clip-clipboard-manager">download AltStore PAL</a> so they could play <em>Ocarina of Time</em> on their iPhones.</p></blockquote><p> If the benefit of the DMA is allowing emulators worldwide how is that an advantage for people in the EU?</p><blockquote><p> Here&#39;s the thing: wouldn&#39;t it just be good business to offer everyone the same choices no matter where they live? It&#39;s not as if Apple was making two different iPhones to try to appeal to different cultural preferences. It&#39;s making one iPhone that&#39;s more flexible and customizable and one that isn&#39;t.</p><p> Maybe, bit by bit, Apple will cave in and offer parity the way it did with emulators. But I think the company should make an uncharacteristic move: drop the charade and let everyone, everywhere have the same iPhone. It would be bold! Courageous, even! But most importantly, it would be a lot more fun.</p></blockquote><p> Yes, let&#39;s allow everyone, around the world, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens">to delete their Camera app</a> .听起来很有趣。</p><p> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@viticci/post/C--2G5btWWb">Federico Viticci, on Threads</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My realization in 2024 has been that the DMA fork of iOS is the best iPhone experience. We can finally use our phones like actual computers with more default apps and apps from external sources.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-dma-version-of-ios-is-more-fun-than-vanilla-ios/">And on MacStories</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s still iOS, with the tasteful design, vibrant app ecosystem, high-performance animations, and accessibility we&#39;ve come to expect from Apple; at the same time, it&#39;s a more flexible and fun version of iOS predicated upon the assumption that users deserve options to control more aspects of how their expensive pocket computers should work. Or, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@viticci/post/C-_Ask_NiBx/">as I put it</a> : some of the flexibility of Android, but on iOS, sounds like a dream to me.</p><p> Apparently, this thought — that people who demand options should have them — <em>really</em> annoys a lot of (generally American) pundits who seemingly consider the European Commission a draconian entity that demands changes out of spite for a particular corporation, rather than a group of elected officials who regulate based on what they believe is best for their constituents and the European market.</p></blockquote><p> Let&#39;s run a tally. On the EU side, there is Fortnite and other games from Epic, a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making">shady</a> company that was justifiably booted from the App Store for bait-and-switch chicanery intended to provoke a lawsuit in which they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/17/apple-epic-legal-fees">got their asses handed back to them</a> . On the rest-of-the-world side we have the imminent release of iPhone Mirroring and Apple Intelligence. I don&#39;t play Fortnite, and even if I did, I wouldn&#39;t on my phone, but I find the latter far more interesting — and fun — than the former.</p><p> The non-Epic iOS software available exclusively in the EU is ... well, nothing of interest. Maybe some apps that help with content piracy.除此之外，什么也没有。 Admittedly, the DMA only went into effect 6 months ago. Long-term, maybe there will arise a thriving ecosystem of useful and fun apps and games that are exclusively available in EU marketplaces. Right now, it&#39;s Fortnite. There are a bunch of articles (and surely soon to be more) informing EU citizens <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-apple-intelligence-in-the-eu/">how to access Apple Intelligence</a> (by lying about where they are). There are crickets chirping regarding how iOS users outside the EU can cheat their way into the EU&#39;s new DMA rules.没有人关心。</p><p> Meanwhile no one in the EU will get Apple Intelligence or iPhone Mirroring, both of which features are very useful, and, dare I say, quite fun. Should we judge how much fun each side of the continental divide is having by how much fun they theoretically <em>could</em> be having, or by how much fun they <em>are</em> having?</p><p> As it stands, the fun side is not the EU.

<p>Emma Roth, reporting for The Verge last week:</p><blockquote><p> Spotify users on iPhone will no longer be able to control the volume on connected devices using their physical volume buttons. In an <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-connect/?ref=related">update to its support page</a> , Spotify said Apple “discontinued” this technology, forcing iPhone owners to use an annoying workaround. [...]</p><p> “We&#39;ve made requests to Apple to introduce a similar solution to what they offer users on HomePod and Apple TV for app developers who control non-Apple media devices,” Spotify says in its update. “Apple has told us that they require apps to integrate into Home Pod in order to access the technology that controls volume on iPhones.”</p></blockquote><p> I believe Spotify has subsequently edited their support page, because the above text <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-connect/?ref=related">no longer appear here</a> , where it now reads:</p><blockquote><p> Apple has discontinued the technology that enables Spotify to control volume for connected devices using the volume buttons on the device. While we work with them on a solution, you can use the Spotify app to easily adjust the volume on your connected device.</p></blockquote><p> It <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113092828219357013">remains unclear to me</a> exactly what is going on here. I <em>think</em> what happened is that what Spotify was doing to enable users to use the hardware volume buttons on their iPhones to control the volume of playback on <em>other</em> devices via Spotify Connect was making use of private or undocumented APIs, and Apple shut those APIs down in iOS 17.6. In short, that it was a hack that stopped working or just stopped working reliably.</p><p> But I was wrong yesterday to say — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/05/spotify-volume-buttons">in the headline of the post</a> , of all places — that Spotify could solve the problem by adopting AirPlay 2. Spotify Connect is, and needs to be, its own separate thing. Spotify users who use Connect <em>love</em> it. Here&#39;s what one DF reader wrote to me: “AirPlay is a per-device feature, while Spotify Connect synchronizes Spotify sessions across devices. I can initiate playing on my iPhone, then control it from my iPad, Mac, or Watch. I can change the destination speaker from any device. It&#39;s so good that I&#39;m forever wedded to Spotify until Apple or someone else comes up with an equivalent experience. I think if AirPlay offered equivalent functionality, but Spotify refused to adopt it, Spotify would be open to more criticism, but from the perspective of a Spotify user, it&#39;s lost functionality and even supporting AirPlay 2 would not fix what is now a diminished experience. So I think Spotify is doing the only thing they can, which is complain.”</p><p> The basic gist is that Apple has always controlled the hardware buttons and switches on iOS devices. Games can&#39;t use the volume buttons as, say, left/right or up/down buttons. In the very early years of the App Store third-party camera apps started using the volume buttons as camera shutter buttons, but Apple then forbade it — and then started using those buttons as shutter buttons in the system Camera app, and then, like 15 years later, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcaptureeventinteraction">finally added an API for this use case in iOS 17.2</a> .</p><p> But note that new API is only for using these buttons for capture:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Important</strong> You can only use this API for capture use cases. The system sends capture events only to apps that actively use the camera. Backgrounded capture apps, and apps not performing capture, don&#39;t receive events.</p></blockquote><p> Spotify (and Sonos) were clearly using the hardware volume buttons in ways unapproved. It&#39;s fair to argue that Apple <em>should</em> provide APIs they can use, especially if it&#39;s for controlling audio volume, even if on another device.但他们没有。</p><p> Also worth noting: when using Apple&#39;s own Remote app to control an Apple TV, the iPhone hardware volume buttons adjust the volume on the Apple TV. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108778">According to Apple</a> this also works when using the Remote app to control an AirPlay-compatible smart TV. That&#39;s the ability Spotify and Sonos seek for themselves.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/09/05/spotify-connect-can-no-longer-use-iphone-volume-buttons/">Michael Tsai</a> .</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> I think <a href="https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment/113093401103795571">Marco Arment nailed it</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My guess is this API, which has been deprecated for a decade:<br /> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmusicplayercontroller/1624567-volume">developer.apple.com/documentation/[...]/mpmusicplayercontroller/</a></p><p> It&#39;s the only way we&#39;ve ever been able to programmatically <em>set</em> the iPhone volume, so it&#39;s how apps would intercept volume buttons: observe it for changes, and upon a change, immediately set it back, then perform the custom action.</p><p> The only other known method is subview-diving on the MPVolumeView, but I don&#39;t think that was ever reliable enough to actually write changes to the volume.</p></blockquote><p> In other words, it wasn&#39;t just a hack that stopped working, it was a pretty filthy hack that stopped working. There has never been an API for third-party apps to use the hardware volume buttons to do what Spotify Connect and Sonos were doing.应该有。 But there never was, and still isn&#39;t.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘More on Spotify Connect and iPhone Volume Buttons’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/06/more-on-spotify-connect-and-iphone-volume-buttons">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vqr" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024://1.41139</id><published> 2024-09-06T15:56:47Z</published><updated> 2024-09-16T21:09:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> What&#39;s happening with Apple Intelligence and iPhone Screen Sharing this year is what I expect to happen with every new product or service Apple creates that integrates with iOS: they will come late, or never, to the EU. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>At the end of August, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zglax7gc">Apple announced several more DMA compliance changes</a> . They are worth examining in detail.</p><h2> Changes to the Mandatory Browser Choice Screen</h2><blockquote><p> Developers of browsers offered in the browser choice screen in the EU will have additional information about their browser shown to users who view the choice screen, and will get access to more data about the performance of the choice screen. The updated choice screen will be shown to all EU users who have Safari set as their default browser. For details about the changes coming to the browser choice screen, view <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/">About the Browser Choice Screen in the EU</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Some of the choice details of the new changes:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p> All users with Safari as their default browser, including users who have already seen the choice screen prior to the update, will see the choice screen upon first launch of Safari after installing the update available later this year.</p></li><li><p> The choice screen will not be displayed if a user already has a browser other than Safari set as default.</p></li><li><p> The choice screen will be shown once per device instead of once per user.</p></li><li><p> When migrating to a new device, if (and only if) the user&#39;s previously chosen default browser was Safari, the user will be required to reselect a default browser (ie unlike other settings in iOS, the user&#39;s choice of default browser will not be migrated if that choice was Safari).</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> I get that the entire point of this mandatory choice screen is that because iOS is, in DMA parlance, a designated “gatekeeping” platform, the presumption is that Apple has unfairly advantaged Safari by bundling it with the OS and making it the default. So, from the European Commission&#39;s perspective, some significant number of iOS users are using Safari <em>only</em> because it is bundled and default, and would prefer and/or be better served — or even just equally served — using another web browser as their default. Thus, Safari gets treated differently. It&#39;s not just another browser in a list of 11. It&#39;s the only browser whose users will be forced to choose again even if they&#39;ve already chosen it in iOS 17.4 or later. It&#39;s the only browser whose users will be forced to choose again whenever they migrate to a new iPhone or iPad. What exactly is the point of forcing this screen per-device rather than per-user, other than to repeatedly irritate Safari users who own multiple iOS devices?</p><p> At what point do these restrictions punish Safari users who <em>want</em> to use Safari? I&#39;d say the EC has crossed that point by forcing these rules on Apple. Another detail:</p><blockquote><ul><li> Users will be required to scroll through the full list of browser options before setting a browser as default.</li></ul></blockquote><p> You know how in certain “terms and conditions” agreement screens, you can only “agree” after scrolling all the way to the bottom of the legalese that almost no one actually reads? That&#39;s how the browser choice screen must now work. Almost nothing in iOS works like this, and I suspect more than a few users who spot their preferred browser above the fold in the randomized list will find it very confusing that after selecting their browser, “nothing happens”. This is legally-mandated bad interaction design.</p><blockquote><p> If Safari is currently in the user&#39;s Dock or on the first page of the Home Screen and the user selects a browser that is not currently installed on their device from the choice screen, the selected browser will replace the Safari icon in the user&#39;s Dock or in the Home Screen.</p></blockquote><p> For 17 years, the iOS Home Screen has been consistently <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2003/04/siracusa_on_the_finder">spatial</a> . Wherever an app is placed on your Home Screen, it stays there. Now, obviously, the EC&#39;s objection is that Apple has unfairly privileged Safari with default placement in the user&#39;s Dock, and they are seeking to remove this privilege for any user who chooses a browser other than Safari on the choice screen. But surely some number of users will regret their choice. Or simply seek to open Safari while trying some other browser as their new default. But now, unlike the way iOS has worked for 17 years, the Safari icon won&#39;t be where they left it. It&#39;s also worth noting that apps in the iOS Dock don&#39;t show their names, only their icons. There surely exist many satisfied Safari users who don&#39;t even know what “Safari” is — they only know the blue-compass icon. And they know that whenever they open URLs from an email or text message, those URLs open in an interface with which they&#39;re completely familiar. The browser choice screen does, of course, show the browsers&#39; icons, but still. This is legally-mandated confusion.</p><p> The list of browsers presented to users remains mostly unchanged from Apple&#39;s previous browser choice screen: the 11 most-downloaded browsers in each member state of the EU. So each of the 27 EU nations has its own list. Apple lists the current browsers, per country, at the bottom of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/">their support page</a> .</p><p> Here is a single list of all included browsers, sorted by how many of the 27 EU nations they&#39;re included in. For the 9 browsers included in all 27 countries, I&#39;ve randomized the order:</p><ul><li> Chrome, Google LLC (27)</li><li> Edge, Microsoft Corporation (27)</li><li> Opera, Opera Software AS (27)</li><li> Brave, Brave Software (27)</li><li> Safari, Apple (27)</li><li> DuckDuckGo, DuckDuckGo, Inc. (27)</li><li> Aloha, Aloha Mobile (27)</li><li> Onion Browser, Mike Tigas (27)</li><li> Firefox, Mozilla (27)</li><li> You, SuSea Inc. (23)</li><li> Ecosia, Ecosia (17)</li><li> Vivaldi, Vivaldi Technologies (13)</li><li> Web@Work, MobileIron (10)</li><li> Web, AirWatch LLC (5)</li><li> Want, Qwant (3)</li><li> Browser, Maple Media Apps LLC (3)</li><li> Access, BlackBerry Corporation (3)</li><li> Seznam.cz, Seznam.cz as (2)</li><li> Presearch, Presearch.org Global Limited (1)</li><li> Avast Secure Browser, AVAST Software (1)</li></ul><p> I was familiar with most of the 9 browsers included in all 27 countries, and you probably are too. But I&#39;d never heard of <a href="https://alohabrowser.com/">Aloha</a> or <a href="https://onionbrowser.com/">Onion Browser</a> — and Onion Browser in particular stands out for coming from an individual developer, Mike Tigas. ( <a href="https://github.com/onionbrowser/onionbrowser">Onion Browser also stands out for being open source</a> .) Both Aloha and Onion are advertised as “privacy focused”, which seems particularly true for Onion Browser, which is connected to <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a> . Aloha includes built-in ad-blocking and a geo-fence skipping VPN.</p><p> So 9 of the 11 spots are occupied by the same popular browsers across the entire EU. Of the other 11 browsers, the only one I&#39;d ever heard of was <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a> , which, like DuckDuckGo, is better known as a search engine (and, like DuckDuckGo, is on the very short list of search engines Safari offers in most countries around the world). <sup id="fnr1-2024-09-06"><a href="#fn1-2024-09-06">1</a></sup></p><p> Did you know that <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/blackberry-dynamics/blackberry-access">BlackBerry made an iOS browser</a> , and that it&#39;s oddly popular in Ireland, Poland, and Sweden?我没有。 (Did you know that BlackBerry still exists? I did not.)</p><p> The entire point of this mandatory browser choice screen is to reach Safari users and make it as easy as possible for them to switch default browsers. But how many such users are there, who <em>should</em> switch? How many users are there who understand what a web browser is, what a default web browser is, are currently using Safari by default, but who see this choice screen and think “ <em>Oh this is great, I had no idea I could switch to one of these other browsers, I&#39;ll do it...</em> ”? I&#39;m sure there exist some such users. But I&#39;m also sure there exist <em>other</em> users who don&#39;t quite know what a web browser is, don&#39;t know that the browser they&#39;re currently using — and perhaps have been using for over a decade — is named “Safari”, and won&#39;t know how to undo a mistake they might make on this browser choice screen. Users who already know how to change their default iOS web browser don&#39;t need this mandatory choice screen; users who <em>don&#39;t</em> know how to change their default browser might be stuck with a mistaken or regretted choice. Pick Safari and you will see this browser choice screen again; pick anything else, perhaps as a lark, and you&#39;ll never see it again.</p><p> My guess is that, perhaps counterintuitively, the single biggest beneficiary of this mandatory browser choice screen will be Google Chrome, which I consider the single most dominant software monopoly in the world today. Users who already know they want to use a non-Safari browser and have set one as their default won&#39;t even see this screen. Users who want to use Safari and <em>know</em> they want to use Safari will merely be annoyed by this screen (repeatedly). But non-technical users who are confused by this screen — and I guaranteed there are millions of such users in the EU alone — will surely just pick a browser they&#39;ve heard of and hope they&#39;ve made the right choice. Chrome is by far the most-used web browser in the world, and for some number of users the only one they&#39;ve ever heard of.</p><p> Shortly after iOS 17.4 shipped in March — the first version with DMA compliance features, and thus the first with a mandatory browser choice screen for Safari users in the EU — there were a few stories about third-party browsers seeing an uptick in users.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/eu-dma-browser-choice-screen-early-impact/?guccounter=1">This one from TechCrunch</a> is perhaps the best example. The gains were mostly reported in <a href="https://x.com/jsnell/status/481863414180896769">Bezos numbers</a> — relative gains with no absolute numbers. Aloha Browser “said users in the EU jumped 250% in March”. Opera reported “39% growth in users on iOS selecting its browser as their default specifically, from March 3 until April 4” — but that was <em>down</em> from 164% growth the previous month, <em>before</em> iOS had implemented the mandatory choice screen in the EU. The one browser that reported actual numbers was Brave:</p><blockquote><p> “The daily installs for Brave on iOS in the EU went from around 7,500 to 11,000 with the new browser panel this past March,” per a company spokesperson. “In the past few days, we have seen a new all time high spike of 14,000 daily installs, nearly doubling our pre-choice screen numbers.”</p></blockquote><p> Since April, I&#39;ve seen bupkis about any continuing “success” of the browser choice screen for small browsers. I suppose that played a part in the EC forcing Apple into the further concessions — especially re-presenting the browser choice screen to all EU iOS users who selected Safari in iOS 17.4, 17.5, or 17.6 already. But I think the truth is obvious: the vast majority of iOS users use Safari because they want to, spanning the gamut from informed nerds who appreciate Safari&#39;s features, UI, and privacy, to non-technical typical users who just know they like the experience with Apple&#39;s first-party ecosystem of apps and services.</p><p> But whatever the effect of this browser choice screen on iOS browser usage in the EU, it&#39;s hard for me to see any way that Chrome doesn&#39;t benefit from it the most. That seems like a perverse outcome for a law intended to regulate “large gatekeepers”. Chrome, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/">with 65 percent market share across all web browsing globally</a> , is a bigger monopoly than iOS, Android, or Windows, and the <em>only</em> other browser with double-digit market share (19 percent) is Safari — the browser the EC is attempting to steer users away from.</p><h2> &#39;Default&#39; Apps</h2><p> Back to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zglax7gc">Apple&#39;s announcement</a> on its Developer News site:</p><blockquote><p> For users in the EU, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will also include a new Default Apps section in Settings that lists defaults available to each user. In future software updates, users will get new default settings for dialing phone numbers, sending messages, translating text, navigation, managing passwords, keyboards, and call spam filters. To learn more, view <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#app-controls">Update on apps distributed in the European Union</a> .</p><p> Additionally, the App Store, Messages, Photos, Camera, and Safari apps will now be deletable for users in the EU.</p></blockquote><p> Keep in mind that at least since iOS 14 (four years ago), we&#39;ve been able to remove any apps we want from our Home screens. It&#39;s just that certain essential system apps can&#39;t be <em>deleted</em> — when removed from your Home screen, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108324">they remain available in the App Library</a> . The App Library was a great addition to iOS, and probably should have come years sooner. But what the EC is demanding from Apple now is the ability to delete these apps. This is particularly tricky with the App Store app, because it&#39;s through the App Store that one can reinstall deleted default iOS apps. Presumably, the App Store app will be reinstallable via Settings, one of only two non-deletable apps. <sup id="fnr2-2024-09-06"><a href="#fn2-2024-09-06">2</a></sup></p><p> What those cheerleading these changes miss is that deleting these core system apps doesn&#39;t magically make iOS a modular system. Apple hasn&#39;t announced any sort of API for third-party apps in the EU to handle SMS (and now RCS) cellular text messaging, and I don&#39;t expect them to. Such an API would be a privacy and security nightmare. <sup id="fnr3-2024-09-06"><a href="#fn3-2024-09-06">3</a></sup> My guess is that if you try to delete the Messages app, iOS will show you a special confirmation alert warning you of the consequences, and if you proceed, your iPhone will simply no longer be able to send or receive SMS or RCS messages. And, obviously, iMessages. What a great feature.</p><p> Likewise, Apple hasn&#39;t announced any sort of API for modular photo storage. Users who delete the system Photos and Camera apps won&#39;t — at this writing — be able to choose some other app to handle photo storage. Photos and videos shot will still go to the system photo library. Images that users have previously stored on their devices will still be in the system photo library. There just won&#39;t be an app from Apple to <em>show</em> the system photo library. My understanding is that, under the hood, neither Photos nor Camera are really “apps” in the traditional sense. They&#39;re just thin wrappers around low-level system frameworks. The same system-level frameworks allow third-party apps to access the system photo library. Apple, seemingly, hasn&#39;t been forced to allow third-party software to replace these low-level system frameworks. They&#39;re just being forced to allow users to “delete” these thin wrappers that present themselves as apps to users. But the actual way that the system photo library works remains unchanged. It&#39;s like if the Mac let you delete the Finder — the file system would still be there, but the user would have no way to browse it.</p><p> An OS with a fundamentally modular design, with APIs that allow nearly every system component to be replaced by third-party software, sounds like a great idea. But no major OS is actually architected like that. iOS certainly is not. So requiring Apple to allow apps like Photos and Camera to be “deleted” is purely facile, and betrays the European Commission&#39;s technical ignorance. The EC bureaucrats issuing these dictums clearly have no idea how iOS actually works. They just know what they can see. iOS ships with a bunch of apps. All they care about is that now users in the EU will be able to delete those apps.</p><p> Sure, many photographers prefer using third-party camera apps to Apple&#39;s system Camera app. But iOS has long offered rich support for using third-party camera apps, and with iOS 18 that support is getting even better, with users soon being able to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-lets-you-replace-the-lock-screens-flashlight-and-camera-buttons/">configure the Lock Screen button</a> that was previously dedicated only to launch the system Camera app. (Same goes for the button heretofore dedicated to the system Flashlight “app” — that&#39;s configurable in iOS 18 too.) Camera apps added to the Lock Screen <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/12/ios-18-lock-screen-camera-api/">even gain special privileges in iOS 18</a> — for all users, worldwide, not just in the EU 。 Even the developers of third-party camera apps <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sdw/post/C_QlXgnPyeG">don&#39;t see any point to being able to delete the system Camera app</a> .</p><p> So who benefits from being able to outright “delete” the Photos and Camera apps? As far as I can tell, only people suffering from OCD who are bothered that after removing them from their Home Screen, that they&#39;re still listed in the App Library. It&#39;s unclear to me whether users in the EU will be able to delete apps like Photos and Camera even if they don&#39;t have any third-party photography apps installed, which would leave their iPhone in a state where there is no way to take new photos or view existing ones. This is performative regulation. None of this deletable apps nonsense increases competition; it merely increases the chances of profound user confusion.</p><p> To be clear, just like with the browser choice screen, I don&#39;t think these “default apps” and “deletable apps” compliance concessions from Apple are going to matter much. By design, deleting apps in iOS is a multi-step process and requires a long tap-and-hold even to get into <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/13/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode-ios-18-mac/">jiggle mode</a> . Even novice users don&#39;t accidentally delete apps. But it&#39;s also true that there&#39;s no measurable demand from users to be able to delete essential system apps. So what&#39;s the point of requiring Apple to support this? Just to watch the company dance?</p><p> I mean why stop here? Why not require Apple to ship new iPhones with only Settings and Phone pre-installed? Why not mandate that users be allowed to delete the entire OS?</p><h2> Apple Intelligence and iPhone Mirroring</h2><p> When <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-dma-financial-times">Apple announced</a> , a few weeks after WWDC in June, that the two biggest features of the year — Apple Intelligence and iPhone Mirroring — would likely remain unavailable in the EU this year “due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act”, DMA supporters suspected spite as the motivation. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/eu_reaping_what_it_sows">I quoted Ian Betteridge then</a> and will quote him again, because I think <a href="https://mastodon.well.com/@ianb/112655916280591098">his reaction epitomizes this viewpoint</a> :</p><blockquote><p> So, Apple, which bits of the DMA does Apple Intelligence violate? Because unless you can actually tell us — which case we clearly have a bit of a problem with some of the claims you&#39;ve made about how it works — or you&#39;re talking bullshit, and just trying to get some leverage with the EU. Which is it Tim?</p><p> I absolutely guarantee that people are going to swallow this “well you can&#39;t make Apple Intelligence work thanks to the DMA!!” line without actually asking any questions about what it violates, because “well Apple said it and they don&#39;t lie evah”</p></blockquote><p> My response to Betteridge in June <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/eu_reaping_what_it_sows">holds up</a> , and looks even more prescient with these latest concessions from Apple.</p><p> As the DMA applies to Apple in particular, where I think DMA supporters go wrong is that they&#39;re not really DMA supporters, but rather App Store opponents. What they feel strongly about is opposing Apple&#39;s tight control over all third-party software on iOS, including, if not especially, control over payments for apps, games, and digital content accessed through native apps. And so they endorse and support the DMA because the DMA breaks that control. Because of the DMA, third-party app marketplaces for iOS now exist in the EU, and apps in Apple&#39;s own App Store are able to opt into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#payment-options">new terms</a> to use their own payment processing (in the EU). Thus, from the perspective of opponents of Apple&#39;s App Store, the DMA must be a net good overall, because they see the point of the DMA (as it pertains to Apple at least) as being about breaking up the App Store&#39;s stranglehold over all iOS third-party native software.</p><p> But that&#39;s not really the point of the DMA at all. It&#39;s just one byproduct of it. And a very high profile byproduct, because supporting alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment processing were regulations that Apple needed to comply with starting in March of this year. If your personal beef with Apple is the App Store model, it&#39;s easy to see how you could conclude that the DMA is about breaking up that model. And if you think the DMA is mostly about breaking up the App Store model, it&#39;s easy to see how you think it&#39;s nonsense that Apple Intelligence and iPhone Mirroring would raise any compliance issues, and so withholding those features from EU users (along with a third feature, enhancements to SharePlay Screen Sharing) must be spite on Apple&#39;s part.</p><p> The thinking, I presume, is that Apple is being spiteful by withholding these features from users in the EU, in the hopes that EU iOS users will turn against the DMA and somehow demand from their EC representatives that it be repealed or amended. But that&#39;s facile. Apple made its case against the DMA, best exemplified by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/11/federighi_sideloading_keynote_at_web_summit">Craig Federighi&#39;s keynote address at Web Summit</a> in Lisbon, Portugal, back in 2021 — to no avail. <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-digital-markets-act">The DMA passed by an overwhelming margin</a> in the European Parliament: 588 votes in favor, 11 votes against, and 31 abstentions. It&#39;s the law of the continent.</p><p> It makes no sense for Apple to withhold tentpole iOS features from EU citizens out of spite. Even if you think Apple is guided by its own self-interest above all else, their biggest self-interest is selling new iPhones. And the biggest new feature in this year&#39;s iPhone 16 models is going to be Apple Intelligence, and the best new feature in iOS 18 is iPhone Screen Sharing. These features will sell iPhones — but not in the EU, at least this year.</p><p> The key is that the DMA is not a targeted attack on the App Store model. It&#39;s a sweepingly broad attack on the entire idea of integration. And integration is Apple&#39;s entire modus operandi. The integration of hardware and software designed to work together. The integration between different devices — <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> — that are designed to work together.</p><p> Also: the integration between different apps on the same device. Safari isn&#39;t just <em>a</em> web browser that just happens to be Apple&#39;s. It&#39;s <em>the</em> web browser designed by Apple to do things <em>the iOS way</em> on iOS (and <em>the Macintosh way</em> on MacOS). If, as a user, you do things the Apple way — owning multiple Apple devices, using iCloud for sync, using Safari as your web browser — you get an integrated experience, with access on device A to the tabs open on device B, shared browsing history and bookmarks between all devices, and support for systemwide services and features. The default apps from Apple on a factory fresh iPhone are designed to work together and present themselves consistently. That&#39;s not to say no one should use third-party apps that are alternatives to Apple&#39;s own.当然不是。 Surely almost every reader of Daring Fireball uses one or more third-party apps that are alternatives to Apple&#39;s. I use several. But the built-in Apple apps, taken together, constitute the Apple-defined experience. Those really are the apps most non-expert users should use. And the best third-party alternatives — like <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> (calendar), <a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop">Cardhop</a> (contacts), <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> (podcasts), and <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> (notes) — fit seamlessly within that overall Apple experience. They&#39;re third-party apps that feel integrated with the first-party experience.</p><p> From the EC&#39;s perspective, everything ought to be modular and commoditized. That&#39;s their ideal for “competition”. A dominant position in “phones” and “tablets” shouldn&#39;t give the company that makes those devices a leg up in the market for web browsers, email clients, messaging, or camera apps. But from Apple&#39;s perspective, the iPhone isn&#39;t merely a “phone”, a piece of commoditized hardware. That&#39;s why the company generally eschews articles, speaking and writing not of “the iPhone” but just “iPhone”. For Apple, iPhone is an integrated experience, encompassing hardware, software, and services, all designed and engineered by Apple itself.</p><p> Now that we have proof that the DMA demands that Apple allow all apps other than Settings (and on iPhones, Phone) to be deleted, and to allow third-party defaults to be set for everything from contactless payments to password management to maps to translation and even keyboards (keyboards?), it&#39;s obvious that the EC might also demand that users be able to specify a third-party “default” AI language model for Apple Intelligence. Not just the optional “world knowledge” layer that Apple is currently partnering exclusively with OpenAI to provide, but the base layer of Apple Intelligence with semantic personal knowledge. Apple Intelligence isn&#39;t designed that way. It&#39;s not a module or an “app”. It&#39;s a deeply integrated layer of the system software. Faced with a decision from the EC that Apple either make all of Apple Intelligence open to third-party AI (including AI systems unvetted by Apple itself), or never offer Apple Intelligence in the EU, I think Apple would choose never to offer it in欧盟。</p><p> As for iPhone Screen Sharing, gatekeeping platforms aren&#39;t permitted under the DMA to preference other products or services from the gatekeeper itself. iPhone Screen Sharing only works between iPhones and Macs — computers made by Apple. That&#39;s against the DMA — or, at least, the EC could clearly rule that it&#39;s against the DMA.</p><p> If the DMA had been in effect 10 years ago, I don&#39;t think Apple Watch would have been available in the EU until and unless the EC said it was permitted. Same for AirPods, which pair with Apple devices in a vastly superior but proprietary way compared to standard Bluetooth. Any sort of integration between an iPhone and another Apple device that isn&#39;t available to third-party devices could be ruled to violate the DMA. By the letter of the DMA, the EC <em>should</em> , I think, rule that all such integration is a violation.</p><p> This uncertainty will likely clear over time. Perhaps the EC will rule that Apple Intelligence and/or iPhone Screen Sharing pose no violation to the DMA, and Apple can make those features available, as they exist today, in the EU. Like, maybe the EC commissioners themselves really just want to break up the App Store model and that&#39;s it. But European Commission vice president Margrethe Vestager clearly believes that Apple Intelligence is anti-competitive and thus a violation of the DMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/GmQ5SsMFbsU?t=4636">Speaking at Forum Europa in July</a> , she said:</p><blockquote><p> I find that very interesting that they say we will now deploy AI where we&#39;re not obliged to enable competition. I think that is the most sort of stunning open declaration that they know 100% that this is another way of disabling competition where they have a stronghold already.</p></blockquote><p> She&#39;s very clear that she believes Apple is “obliged to enable competition” with AI under the DMA. Apple Intelligence enables no competition at all. Something has to give here.</p><p> The EC&#39;s apparent expectation is that because the European Union is so large and so essential to the world, Apple — along with the DMA&#39;s other targeted “gatekeepers” — will bend to its will and henceforth design its products and services with the DMA in mind. Modularity over integration, at all layers of the stack. Thierry Breton, the EU internal market commissioner, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/898338c2-b9fd-4494-be3f-75b7c669c705">quipped in July</a> : “Apple&#39;s new slogan should be &#39;act different&#39;.”</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">But the EU isn&#39;t <em>that</em> large or essential</a> . The European Commission is beset by delusions of grandeur. What&#39;s happening with Apple Intelligence and iPhone Screen Sharing this year is what I expect to happen with every new product or service Apple creates that integrates with iOS: they will come late, or never, to the EU. And all new products and services Apple creates integrate with iOS, so almost everything new from Apple will come late, or never, to the EU.</p><p> While not the <em>intention</em> , that&#39;s the actual <em>effect</em> of the DMA.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2024-09-06"><p> The fact that DuckDuckGo and Ecosia are both the names of search engines supported within Safari <em>and</em> web browsers that are standalone alternatives to Safari is surely going to be a point of confusion for non-technical users.

<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> Spotify claims Apple may again be in violation of European regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires interoperability from big technology companies dubbed “gatekeepers.” This time, the issue isn&#39;t about in-app purchases, links or pricing information, but rather how Apple has discontinued the technology that allows Spotify users to control the volume on their connected devices.</p><p> When streaming to connected devices via Spotify Connect on iOS, users were previously able to use the physical buttons on the side of their iPhone to adjust the volume. As a result of the change, this will no longer work. To work around the issue, Spotify iOS users will instead be directed to use the volume slider in the Spotify Connect menu in the app to control the volume on connected devices.</p><p> The company notes that this issue doesn&#39;t affect users controlling the volume on iOS Bluetooth or AirPlay sessions, nor users on Android.

<p>Annie Karni, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> During an event at Duke University, Ms. Cheney told students that it was not enough for her to simply oppose the former president, if she intended to do whatever was necessary to prevent Mr. Trump from winning the White House again, as she has long said she would.</p><p> “I don&#39;t believe we have the luxury of writing in candidates&#39; names, particularly in swing states,” Ms. Cheney said, speaking to students in the hotly contested state of North Carolina. “As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris ”。</p><p> The room erupted in cheers after she made her unexpected announcement.</p></blockquote><p> I have so much respect for Cheney. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9nAnju6Kqw">Her father too</a> , but he&#39;s retired. Liz Cheney took this principled stand while she was one of the most influential Republicans in the nation. I get being a conservative, politically. I get being opposed to the Democratic Party, politically. Liz Cheney is a conservative and — like her father — endorses very different policies than Kamala Harris. But (lowercase &#39;d&#39;) democratic politics ought to be viewed very much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs</a> are in psychology. Some things matter more than others. And nothing — not climate change or the environment, not reproductive rights, and certainly not fucking tax rates — nothing matters more than support for democracy itself and the rule of law. The only way we&#39;re going to get those other things right — which are really, really important — is through democratic governance and the rule of law.</p><p> Trump is 100 percent anti-Democratic-Party but he&#39;s no conservative. I don&#39;t support or endorse a Reagan/Bush/Cheney political viewpoint, but that viewpoint is coherent. Trump espouses no coherent views at all. He literally tried to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61084161">He&#39;s a criminal</a> . <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPcPlTQ8Vto">He&#39;s mentally deranged</a> , <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-looks-older-and-more-deranged/679186/">decrepitly old</a> , and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/C_hFt23q0_Z">failing before our eyes</a> . “ <em>I don&#39;t like Democrats</em> ” is — with Trump on the ballot and polling within the margin of error of winning — not high enough on the political hierarchy of needs to cast one&#39;s vote for anyone but Kamala Harris.</p><p> If the Democratic candidate were a Trump-like decrepit crooked lunatic, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate, for a second, to vote for, say, Republican Liz Cheney for president. None of this namby-pamby bullshit about “writing in” a non-candidate&#39;s name. No protest voting for a third-party candidate. The next president is either going to be Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, and only one of the two believes in anything at all — anything — that this great country stands for.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Liz Cheney: ‘Not Only Am I Not Voting for Donald Trump, but I Will Be Voting for Kamala Harris’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/cheney-harris">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump Threatens Zuckerberg With &#39;Life in Prison&#39; in New Book </title><link href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/trump-zuckerberg-election-book-00176639" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vqo" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/trump-zuckerberg-prison" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.41136</id><published> 2024-09-04T14:42:22Z</published><updated> 2024-09-04T15:00:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alex Isenstadt, writing for Politico:</p><blockquote><p> “ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Save-America-Donald-J-Trump/dp/B0D9HS4CWN/">Save America</a> ,” a Trump-authored coffee table book being released Sept. 3, includes an undated photograph of Trump meeting with Zuckerberg in the White House. Under the photo, Trump writes that Zuckerberg “would come to the Oval Office to see me. He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,” Trump added, referring to a <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/press/chan-zuckerberg-increase-2020-election-support/">$420 million</a> contribution Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, made during the 2020 election to fund election infrastructure.</p><p> “He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump continues. “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”</p></blockquote><p> I was not aware that “steering” a social network against a presidential candidate was not only illegal, but subject to life in prison. Elon Musk better be careful with anti-Kamala-Harris posts <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1830656672211103825">like this one</a> , because I&#39;m sure Trump feels just as strongly about “steering” in either direction.

<p>Last year Nolen Royalty made a website called One Million Checkboxes, which presented to the user exactly what it claimed on the tin. The gimmick was that the million checkboxes were shared globally. If I toggled checkbox 206,028 in my browser, you&#39;d see checkbox 206,028 flip state in <em>your</em> browser. Totally pointless. Totally fun.</p><p> Here, Royalty tells the story of how the site was used by bot-writing teenage hackers:</p><blockquote><p> Lots of people were mad about bots on OMCB. I&#39;m not going to link to anything here — I don&#39;t want to direct negative attention at anyone — but I got hundreds of messages about bots. The most popular tweet about OMCB complained about bots. People … did not like bots.</p><p> And I get it! The typical ways that folks — especially folks who don&#39;t program — bump into bots are things like ticket scalping and restaurant reservation bots. Bots that feel selfish and unfair and antisocial.</p><p> And there certainly was botting that you could call antisocial. Folks wrote tiny javascript boxes to uncheck every box that they could — I know this because they excitedly told me. [...]</p><p> What this discord did was so cool — so surprising — so creative. It reminded me of me — except they were 10 times the developer I was then (and frankly, better developers than I am now). Getting to watch it live — getting to provide some encouragement, to see what they were doing and respond with praise and pride instead of anger — was deeply meaningful to me. I still tear up when I think about it.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://kottke.org/24/08/secret-message-in-one-million-checkboxes">Via Jason Kottke</a> , who aptly observes that the way the hackers got in touch with Royalty “reminds me of the palimpsest (layered communication) that the aliens use to communicate with Earth in Carl Sagan&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501197983/ref=nosim/0sil8"><em>Contact</em></a> (and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film)">1997 movie</a> ).”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Secret Inside One Million Checkboxes’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/the-secret-inside-one-million-checkboxes">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Oprah Winfrey Is Hosting a Prime-Time TV Special on AI </title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/oprahs-upcoming-ai-television-special-sparks-outrage-among-tech-critics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vql" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/oprah-ai" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.41133</id><published> 2024-09-04T14:00:42Z</published><updated> 2024-09-04T15:33:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Benj Edwards:</p><blockquote><p> On Thursday, ABC <a href="https://abc.com/news/1efd942d-61bb-4519-8a62-c4a8fce50792/category/1138628">announced an upcoming TV special</a> titled, “AI and the Future of Us: An Oprah Winfrey Special.” The one-hour show, set to air on September 12, aims to explore AI&#39;s impact on daily life and will feature interviews with figures in the tech industry, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Bill Gates. Soon after the announcement, some AI critics began questioning the guest list and the framing of the show in general. [...]</p><p> In a nod to present-day content creation, YouTube creator Marques Brownlee will appear on the show and reportedly walk Winfrey through “mind-blowing demonstrations of AI&#39;s capabilities.”</p><p> Brownlee&#39;s involvement received special attention from some critics online. “Marques Brownlee should be absolutely ashamed of himself,” <a href="https://x.com/edzitron/status/1829719392026059053">tweeted</a> PR consultant and frequent AI critic Ed Zitron, who frequently <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/">heaps scorn</a> on generative AI in his own newsletter. “What a disgraceful thing to be associated with.”</p></blockquote><p> What a jackassed take from Zitron.我的意思是考虑一下。 Imagine that Oprah&#39;s producers get in touch with MKBHD to ask if he&#39;d like to participate in a prime-time network TV special about AI, specifically to show cool AI use cases, and he was like, “Nah, I don&#39;t think this special is going to sufficiently present the viewpoint of a wide enough array of AI critics.”</p><p> These galaxy-brain peanut gallerians haven&#39;t even seen clips from the show, let alone the entire special itself. They&#39;re judging it by <em>the guest list</em> . A guest list that in fact includes obvious critics and skeptics. Edwards:</p><blockquote><p> Other guests include Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin from the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a> , who aim to highlight “emerging risks posed by powerful and superintelligent AI,” an existential risk topic that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/feds-appoint-ai-doomer-to-run-us-ai-safety-institute/">its own critics</a> . And FBI Director Christopher Wray will reveal “the terrifying ways criminals and foreign adversaries are using AI,” while author Marilynne Robinson will reflect on “AI&#39;s threat to human values.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s also quite likely that invited guests weren&#39;t told who the other interview subjects were. That&#39;s just not how these things work. Oprah&#39;s production surely shot dozens of hours of interviews to cut into a one-hour special — some of the subjects were likely left on the cutting-room floor.</p><p> If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything short of fucking cool that Marques Brownlee is getting a spot to show off cool AI use cases to Oprah in a prime-time network TV special, you&#39;re a jackass. And if you&#39;re going to argue that there are no cool AI use cases, you&#39;re a liar.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Oprah Winfrey Is Hosting a Prime-Time TV Special on AI’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/04/oprah-ai">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Sports, Updated for Football Season, Will Soon Support Live Activities </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/apple-sports-is-ready-for-football-season/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vqk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/apple-sports-football-live-activities" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.41132</id><published> 2024-09-03T22:17:38Z</published><updated> 2024-09-04T15:14:53Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> With iOS 18 and watchOS 11, the Apple Sports app will offer Live Activities for all teams and leagues available in the app for the first time ever, delivering live scores and play-by-play at a quick glance to a user&#39;s iPhone and Apple Watch Lock Screens.</p><p> Coming in an app update later this year, Apple Sports will also introduce a new drop-down navigation for the main scorecard views, making it even faster to switch between My Leagues, My Teams, and users&#39; feeds for favorited leagues. A new enhanced search makes it easier to view matches for leagues fans do not currently follow.</p></blockquote><p> Does anyone understand why it requires <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/31/live-activities-ios-18/">iOS 18</a> for Live Activities? Perhaps it&#39;s just a subtle nudge to get people to upgrade their device OS?</p><p> Also: Interesting but unsurprising to me that Apple Sports will support Live Activities on WatchOS, but won&#39;t offer a WatchOS app. I think this is the way most — or at least many — apps should support WatchOS going forward. It&#39;s just never been a great platform for “apps”. It&#39;s a great platform for glanceable information, though.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Via email, DF reader Deep Desai explains the iOS 18 requirement:</p><blockquote><p> This is definitely because <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting-up-broadcast-push-notifications">broadcast push notifications</a> require iOS 18 — this lets you create a channel on APNS which devices can subscribe to. It&#39;s pub/sub instead of collecting individual push tokens from devices and sending them each a notification.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Sports, Updated for Football Season, Will Soon Support Live Activities’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/apple-sports-football-live-activities">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Departure Mono </title><link href="https://departuremono.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vqj" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/departure-mono" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.41131</id><published> 2024-09-03T21:53:44Z</published><updated> 2024-09-04T15:34:06Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
