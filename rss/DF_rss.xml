<p>艾伦·塞平沃尔（Alan Sepinwall）为《滚石》杂志撰稿：</p><blockquote><p> <em>《老友记》</em>试播集中马修·佩里的出场次数并不多，但他却讲了其中最有趣的笑话之一。当这伙人围坐在 Central Perk 附近时，刚离婚的罗斯承认他只是想再次结婚。一秒钟后，雷切尔浑身湿透，穿着婚纱走进咖啡店。佩里饰演的钱德勒·宾毫不犹豫地宣称：“我只想要一百万美元！”</p><p>就像钱德勒的许多妙语一样，它的讽刺很快又尖锐。就像钱德勒的许多妙语一样，佩里的表达将它从几十个演员可以说出的自作聪明的俏皮话提升为你无法想象从其他人嘴里说出的话。</p><p>注意事情的时间和重点。 “And I”之后的停顿，他用力敲击“I”的方式，以及他在说“Million Dollars”时声音充满游戏节目主持人的方式，所有这些结合起来，给这个笑话带来了超出预期的音乐性。 <em>《老友记》的</em>创作者玛塔·考夫曼和大卫·克兰在页面上写道。这是一集中的一个小时刻，主要涉及钱德勒·宾以外的角色。但当你观看它时，你想听他一次又一次地说类似的话。</p></blockquote><p>佩里在<em>《老友记》</em>中表现出色，但我最喜欢他参加的节目是<em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/studio-60-on-the-sunset-strip/umc.cmc.2shyb7anow8v1rlv12c6lsx7v">日落大道上短命的 Studio 60</a></em> ，这是 2006 年亚伦·索金 (Aaron Sorkin) 的节目，我一直认为它部分失败<sup>*</sup>因为它比它早了几年时间。该剧仅有 22 集，在 NBC 播出。对于网络电视来说，它太智能、太电影化了。它应该在像 HBO 这样的有线频道上播出，或者如果十年后播出的话，应该在流媒体服务上播出。这部剧非常精彩（有时，22 集对于追求如此品质的剧集来说太多了），而且佩里也很出色。</p><p>佩里也值得赞扬，因为他对自己长期与毒瘾作斗争的坦诚态度，以及他真诚地愿意帮助任何人和其他人解决这个问题。安息。</p><p> <small>* 我不知道这是否伤害了<em>日落大道上的 Studio 60</em> ，但另一个奇怪的事情是它与蒂娜·菲 (Tina Fey) 的名人堂搞笑情景喜剧<em><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/30-rock/6240863759978157112">《30 Rock》</a></em>同年在同一网络上首次亮相。这两部剧有着相同的基本前提：它们都是关于<em>《周六夜现场》</em>的虚构版本。他们的头衔中甚至都有数字，而且这些数字出奇地相似。 <em>《Studio 60》</em>是一部搞笑剧， <em>《30 Rock》</em>是情景喜剧中的情景喜剧，但我一直想知道同时推出两部关于<em>《周六夜现场》</em>的<em>罗马谱号</em>是不是一个坏主意。</small></p><div> <a  title="永久链接“马修·佩里是《老友记》的讽刺灵魂”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-soul-of-friends">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “马修·佩里让事情看起来很简单” </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-chandler-bing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3z" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40319</id><published> 2023-10-29T19:17:26Z</published><updated> 2023-10-29T19:17:27Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>亚历克西斯·索洛斯基（Alexis Soloski）为《纽约时报》撰文：</p><blockquote><p>坦白说：当我收到演员马修·佩里（Matthew Perry）去世的消息时，我的脑海里浮现出佩里完善的钱德勒·宾（Chandler Bing）角色的特殊节奏，他在 NBC 情景喜剧《<em>老友记》</em>中扮演了 10 季的角色。我的想法是这样的：“这<em>还能</em>更悲伤吗？”</p><p> 54 岁的佩里在<em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething">《朋友、恋人和可怕的大事》</a></em>出版近一年后<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html">去世</a>，这是一本异常坦率的关于毒瘾和康复的回忆录。正如他在那本书中详细描述的那样，他职业生涯中最美好的岁月是在健忘、回避、麻木中度过的——这些条件通常不会鼓励出色的表演。但他很棒。希望清醒能让他好起来，让他恢复到巅峰时期那种紧张、本能的光彩，这似乎是合理的，虽然有些玫瑰色。现在这个希望已经破灭了。 [...]</p><p>说他从未做过像<em>《老友记</em>》之前或之后那样好的事情，并不是贬低他的成就。即使在他的搭档们难以抑制的才华中，佩里也脱颖而出，他以一种橡胶般、漫不经心的肢体喜剧方式和大多数秒表都会羡慕的瞬间计时。如果你看过该剧的几集以上——而且有数以百万计的人看过，包括在首播几年后出生的粉丝——你就会吸收钱德勒的节奏、他的流行语，以及佩里英俊、​​月亮般的脸像氨纶一样伸展的方式。 ，卖出反应越好。他既对一条线的要求有绝对的承诺，又以一种温和地讽刺这条线的方式。他的性格是笑柄。佩里也参与了同样的笑话。他身上有一种孩子气，这似乎可以为他的角色在<em>《老友记》</em>和随后的角色中最糟糕的行为找借口。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接“Matthew Perry Made It Look Easy”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/29/perry-made-it-look-easy">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>脱口秀节目：“情歌太多了吗？” </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/10/27/ep-387" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/the-talk-show-387" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40317</id><published> 2023-10-28T00:51:01Z</published><updated> 2023-10-28T00:51:01Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell 在《六色》上撰文介绍了 iOS 17.2 中新的“在消息中使用表情符号作为贴纸反应”功能，该功能今天刚刚作为公开测试版发布：</p><blockquote><p>相反，要发送贴纸回复，您必须点击并按住一条消息，然后从出现的上下文菜单中选择“添加贴纸”，然后选择贴纸或表情符号。这是一个实际上没有必要的额外步骤，并且使贴纸感觉像是事后才想到的，而事实显然确实如此。</p><p>情况变得更糟。当您添加贴纸反应时，它会放置在您要做出反应的消息的顶部，遮盖部分文本！为什么苹果会选择一个让人无法阅读正在回复的文本的位置呢？这些反应的正确位置是……等等……与 Tapbacks 出现的位置相同，在一个小气泡中，依偎在正在反应的消息上。</p></blockquote><p>这个设计让我感觉有点恶意。我怀疑苹果公司内部有两支队伍：“ <em>Tapbacks 本身就是完美的”一方（他们</em>更喜欢只有六种——心形、竖起大拇指、竖起大拇指、哈哈、“!!”，以及“？”——谁坚持认为它们是单色的），而“<em>天啊，世界上所有其他流行的消息平台都允许用户用他们想要的全彩表情符号做出反应</em>”。这个新的表情符号贴纸功能对于后者来说是一个小小的胜利，但 Tapbacks 是完美的一方正在发号施令，并将 Tapbacks 作为唯一的反应，(a) 非常容易应用，并且 ( b) 不要模糊消息的文本。</p><p>我一直在使用该功能，我发现的一个表情符号<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/emoji-stickers-finger.jpeg">仅<em>勉强</em>遮盖了它所应用的消息文本，</a>而这恰好是表达我对该功能当前如何工作的感受的完美表情符号：🖕。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“iOS 17.2（Beta）贴纸反应臭”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/ios-17-sticker-reactions-stink">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Google 每年花费 260 亿美元成为几乎所有地方的默认搜索引擎（其中大部分都归谁所有） </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934961/google-antitrust-trial-defaults-search-deal-26-3-billion" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40314</id><published> 2023-10-27T19:31:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T19:53:50Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>大卫·皮尔斯（David Pierce）为 The Verge 撰文：</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates"><em>美国诉谷歌</em>反垄断审判</a>涉及很多事情，但最重要的是，它涉及违约的力量。即使切换浏览器、平台或搜索引擎很容易，打开它时出现的那个也很重要。谷歌显然同意这一点，并支付了巨额费用来确保其成为默认搜索引擎：审判中的证词显示，谷歌在 2021 年总共花费了 263 亿美元，以成为多个浏览器、手机和平台的默认搜索引擎。 [...]</p><p>简单来说一下这 263 亿美元的背景：谷歌母公司 Alphabet 在 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23929496/google-alphabet-q3-2023-earnings-ads-ai-sge">其最近的收益报告</a>中宣布，谷歌搜索广告业务在过去三个月中带来了约 440 亿美元的收入，去年约为 1650 亿美元。其整个广告业务（还包括 YouTube 广告）的利润略低于 900 亿美元。这都是纸巾后面的数学，但本质上，谷歌正在将其搜索收入的约 16% 和利润的约 29% 放弃给这些分销交易。</p><p>当然，大部分资金都流向了苹果。 《纽约时报》最近报道称，谷歌成为谷歌产品 Safari 中默认搜索引擎的交易使该公司在 2021 年损失了 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion">约 180 亿美元</a>。</p></blockquote><p>高盛分析师多年来一直在估计这个数字，2021 年的 180 亿美元与他们的估计基本一致。 （高盛<em>保守</em>估计，到 2023 年，谷歌向苹果支付的<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traffic-acquisition-cost-tac.asp">TAC</a>费用约为 170 亿美元。这将是最低值——苹果<em>至少</em>从谷歌那里获得了这么多的合作伙伴关系。）</p><p> Apple 将这一收入计入服务项目，该<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/charts-apple-q3-2023-results/">收入每季度增长超过 200 亿美元</a>。因此，Apple 服务收入的 20-25% 仅来自 Google 的这些付款。你可以明白为什么<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google">苹果在这场诉讼中支持谷歌</a>。</p><p>与谷歌的整个合作关系是苹果整体隐私立场中最薄弱的环节。谷歌通过用户跟踪从搜索中赚取了如此多的钱，苹果会认为这违背了自己的内部价值观。如果苹果运行自己的搜索引擎，它将比谷歌搜索<em>更加</em>私密。但相反，他们与 Google 合作，将 Google 设置为所有平台上 Safari 的默认设置，并分享 Google 每年约 200 亿美元的利润。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Google 每年花费 260 亿美元成为几乎所有地方的默认搜索引擎（其中大部分都归谁所有）”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/google-aggregate-search-default">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>更像 RipoffOS，我说得对吗？ </title><link href="https://www.gizchina.com/2023/10/19/hyperos-xiaomi-poco-redmi/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/xiaomi-hyperos" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40313</id><published> 2023-10-27T18:44:03Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T18:44:04Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>轴：</p><blockquote><p>新众议院议长迈克·约翰逊（路易斯安那州共和党人）在他作为议长的第一次采访中告诉福克斯新闻的肖恩·汉尼蒂，现在不是讨论立法解决大规模枪击祸害的时候，他补充道：“问题在于人心，不是枪。”</p></blockquote><p>由于地球上没有其他文明国家发生过这样的屠杀，约翰逊含蓄地认为问题不在于<em>人心</em>，而在于<em>美国人的</em>心。</p><p>或者，也许问题在于，美国是<em>唯一一个</em>军用级突击步枪不仅合法，而且像缅因州的这个疯子这样患有精神疾病的愤怒男子也可以合法获得的国家。</p><p>要么我们是地球上最糟糕的人，要么我们拥有最糟糕的枪支法。</p><blockquote><p>重要性：在缅因州刘易斯顿发生导致 18 人死亡的枪击事件后，拜登总统和国会民主党人敦促采取行动。约翰逊认为，“在危机期间”讨论枪支管制是不合适的，他认为，“问题不是武器，而是根本问题。”</p></blockquote><p>每次枪支屠杀之后，共和党人都会提出“<em>现在不是时候</em>”的论点。就在他们发布“思考和祈祷”的推文之后。废话。大屠杀之后是要求采取理智的枪支管制措施的<em>时候</em>了。这时候问题就清楚了。共和党人会认为 10 月 8 日不是以色列讨论哈马斯恐怖主义的“合适时机”吗？ 2001 年 9 月 12 日是否“不是讨论基地组织的最佳时机”？罗斯福是否应该在 1941 年 12 月 8 日向全国发表讲话，建议我们放松，让冷静的头脑占上风，因为日本袭击珍珠港的后果“不是考虑报复的时候”？</p><p>想象一下，一名委内瑞拉难民下周非法越过美墨边境，并用他携带的炸弹杀死了 18 名美国公民。汉尼蒂是否会邀请福克斯新闻的嘉宾——比如迈克·约翰逊——辩称“在危机之中，现在不是谈论边境安全的时候”？</p><p>我们对这些屠杀的情绪反应是合理的。趁着铁和我们的血液还热的时候出击。让我们的情绪加剧我们试图以<a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/instant-intel/house-gun-legislation-background-checks-polling">压倒性的受欢迎的枪支管制立法</a>做出回应的紧迫性，并让共和党人在两周后进入选举反对他们。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“大屠杀的后果永远是推动枪支立法的时候”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/27/aftermath">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CT 扫描揭示了 Apple 售价 129 美元的 Thunderbolt 电缆的复杂性</title><link href="https://twitter.com/jonbruner/status/1714696044356005949" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/apple-thunderbolt-cable" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40309</id><published> 2023-10-26T00:00:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T00:57:06Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">乔·罗西尼奥尔 (Joe Rossignol)，MacRumors</a> ：</p><blockquote><p> Apple 今天宣布，将提高部分订阅服务的价格，其中包括 Apple TV+、Apple Arcade 和 Apple News+，面向美国和<a href="https://www.macg.co/services/2023/10/augmentation-imminente-des-abonnements-apple-arcade-apple-tv-et-apple-one-140063">全球许多其他国家的</a>新老订阅用户。</p><p>美国价格变化如下：</p><ul><li> Apple TV+：每月 6.99 美元 → 每月 9.99 美元</li><li>Apple Arcade：每月 4.99 美元 → 每月 6.99 美元</li><li>Apple News+：每月 9.99 美元 → 每月 12.99 美元</li></ul><p>对于按年订阅 Apple TV+ 的用户，价格相应从每年 69 美元上涨至每年 99 美元。</p><p>包含这些服务的 Apple One 捆绑包的价格也因此上涨：</p><ul><li>个人：每月 16.95 美元 → 每月 19.95 美元</li><li>家庭：每月 22.95 美元 → 每月 25.95 美元</li><li>高级：每月 32.95 美元 → 每月 37.95 美元</li></ul><p>[...] Apple Music 和 Apple Fitness+ 今天没有涨价。</p></blockquote><p>我本来想链接到苹果新闻编辑室宣布这些价格上涨的消息，但那里没有任何关于它们的消息。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple Newsroom</a>是一个“仅限好消息”的公司博客。</p><p>在 Apple One 捆绑包层面，这些增长相当温和，但在独立层面，这些增长是引人注目的。 TV+ 现在的价格是<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">四年前推出时的</a>两倍。</p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1717188520123445666">Tom Warren 在 Twitter/X 上</a>对流媒体服务不断上涨的价格做出了敏锐的观察：</p><blockquote><p>如果 Apple TV、Netflix 和 Disney+ 继续提高价格，只会迫使更多人陷入盗版。令人惊讶的是，英国有多少人使用改装的 Fire TV 棒来观看盗版电视节目和电影。</p></blockquote><p>我会对他的动词选择提出质疑，并建议“推动”而不是“强制”——没有人<em>被迫</em>盗版内容——但这一点是正确的。自从 20 年前 iTunes 音乐商店开业以来，正值通过 Napster 和类似平台进行 MP3 文件共享的鼎盛时期，我一直认为媒体盗版是一种谈判形式。这就像用户和公司之间的临时集体谈判，确定价格并定义媒体消费体验。</p><p>订阅定价需要一种微积分来找到产生最多收益的最佳点。将价格定得太低，可以减少盗版，但会浪费金钱。如果价格定得太高，你赚到的钱就会减少，因为更多的用户（原本可能以较低价格订阅的用户）会选择盗版。 （当然，有些人总是会选择盗版。试图找到一个价格来安抚他们是没有意义的。）</p><p>但定价并不是这个等式中的唯一因素。体验也是。走私的明显吸引力在于价格：零。但总是有点让人头疼。奇怪的应用程序和粗略的来源。史蒂夫·乔布斯在介绍 iTunes 音乐商店时强调了这一点：99 美分的价格很有吸引力，但不如免费那么有吸引力。但从 iTunes 搜索和下载音乐的整体体验比盗版要好得多，以至于你愿意为这些歌曲付费。</p><p>苹果仍然得到了这一点：他们使用其服务的应用程序通常很少有烦恼。您几乎永远不需要重新登录，因为您之前的登录已过期。我在 Apple TV 上使用的许多流媒体视频服务让我在那些令人难以置信的烦人的登录流程中经历了很多麻烦，在这些流程中，您必须使用其他设备（可能是您的手机，如果您是在沙发上），然后输入电视屏幕上的代码。然后你必须等待大约 20 秒，他们才会让你重新进入。然后几个月后，你必须因为无法解释的原因再次这样做。</p><p>每当官方服务让你观看不可跳过的广告时，每次他们糟糕的自定义视频播放器使快进或快退卡顿时，每次他们糟糕的应用程序感觉缓慢或忘记你在几天前暂停的电影中的位置时 - 那些小烦恼越积越多，与盗版内容相比，付费内容应提供的用户体验优势就会降低。</p><p>如果“盗版还是付费？”用户的争论只是关于价格，无数的人会盗版他们的音乐、内容和游戏。它更像是这样的：</p><ul><li><p><strong>盗版：</strong>无需支付任何费用（好），对窃取内容感到内疚（坏），经历获取盗版内容以及破解游戏和应用程序副本的所有麻烦，并管理您自己的本地内容库（这些内容从这些内容中脱落）众所周知的卡车（坏）。此外，还存在法律纠纷的风险，您的互联网服务被禁用，或者如果某个盗版监管机构抓住您，您会感到非常尴尬（糟糕）。</p></li><li><p><strong>付费：</strong>支付每月的服务订阅费（坏），因为没有偷任何东西而感到内疚（好），避免获取和管理盗版媒体内容的麻烦（好），并享受使用的便捷性该服务的官方应用程序。</p></li></ul><p>我没有在最后一项后面加上“（好）”或“（坏）”，因为一项服务与另一项服务之间的差异如此之大。多年来我盗取的唯一内容是那些无法通过合法渠道获得的稀有电影，例如<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition">原始星球大战三部曲的精彩“非专业”版本</a>。除了我的钱多过理智之外，我在消费娱乐方面也非常懒惰。我根本不想工作来查找它、下载它或管理它。但有些流媒体应用程序太糟糕了，以至于让人感觉合法观看其内容与盗版内容一样费力。</p><p>关于 Netflix，有一点被大大低估了：他们总是提供出色的用户体验。他们的应用程序快速、可靠且设计精良。 Netflix 永远不会忘记我的登录凭据，也不会使其过期。您可以看出，Netflix 的每个人，包括特德·萨兰多斯和里德·黑斯廷斯，<em>都关心</em>整个用户体验。从文化上来说，Netflix 在这方面很像苹果：他们的公司 DNA 中融入了良好的品味。</p><p>至于今天苹果的价格上涨，我是一名 Apple One Premier 订户，我很好——当然，不高兴，但很好——每月额外支付 5 美元来购买我所得到的一切。在独立价格上涨的三项组件服务中，TV+ 和 Arcade 似乎是合理的。然而，新闻+却没有。</p><p>几年来我一直在说 Apple TV+ 正在成为新的 HBO——一个专注于著名原创内容的频道，质量重于数量——现在 HBO<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/warner_max">在 Max 内部被淡化</a>，这感觉比以往任何时候都更加真实。 Apple TV+ 提供源源不断的原创节目，我的家人非常喜欢。我很确定 TV+ 上我们最喜欢的节目比任何其他服务都多。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">与 Netflix 不同的是</a>，苹果坚持保留所有好剧，并将其续订多季，让它们有一个令人满意的结局。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-25">1</a></sup> TV+ 的平均内容质量远高于 Disney+，Disney+ 一直在制作<em>《阿索卡》</em>和<em>《秘密入侵》</em>等<a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CyHm6Ots64Q">令人尴尬的系列坦克大片</a>，而相对令人失望的作品有<em>《欧比旺·克诺比》</em> （一部夸张的六集连续剧，本应被削减为一部完整的两小时电影），只有偶尔出现像<em>安多</em>这样的宝石。虽然 Apple TV+ 长期以来因其相对缺乏旧图书馆内容而脱颖而出，但就原创新内容而言，它比 Amazon Prime、Hulu、Max 或落选者有更多的好东西（至少就我的口味而言）比如 Peacock 和 Paramount+。与新的原创内容相比，我只是不太关心对旧图书馆内容的流式访问，而且我认为大多数其他人也不会这样做。</p><p>至于Apple Arcade——我个人玩的电子游戏不多，但我在iPhone上<em>玩</em>的游戏越来越多地来自Arcade。没有广告，没有应用内购买付费获胜的欺骗行为，并且拥有不断增长的跨越各种类型的真正优秀游戏库。 7 美元/月感觉很公平。</p><p>但新闻+？ Apple News+ 的主要且明显的吸引力是可以访问《华尔街日报》等<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/publications/">参与出版物</a>的付费内容。这是一长串报纸和杂志。但实际的阅读体验往往很糟糕——Apple News 中大多数出版商的大多数文章都很糟糕，带有巨大的丑陋广告，每隔几个段落就将每篇文章分开。而且这些广告往往都是低级的<a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/">骗局</a>，几乎可笑。几周前，我在 Mastodon 上发布了<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">其中一些的屏幕截图</a>。看看他们就知道了。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-25"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-25">2</a></sup>这些广告——以及它们的数量——看起来或感觉不像您应该在 10 美元/月的高级订阅中体验到的东西——更不用说 13 美元/月的新价格了。 News+ 提价的唯一理由是，苹果是否计划利用增加的订阅费收入来减少文章中的广告数量<em>并</em>提高其质量。</p><p>与盗版媒体、盗版游戏和应用程序一样，广告拦截是用户和发行商之间的谈判。至少对我来说，在网络浏览器中阅读同一篇文章（安装了阻止用户恶意广告的扩展程序）几乎总是比在 Apple News 中阅读要好得多的体验。鉴于 News+ 是一种价格不菲的付费订阅，用户体验方程式应该是相反的：在 Apple News 中阅读应该比在网络上阅读更好。但事实并非如此。然而苹果却在提高价格。</p><p>最后，我会略显烦恼但绝对零惊讶地指出，虽然苹果现在<a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/apple-price-increase-apple-tv-plus-music-1235412633/#">每年左右都在稳步提高其媒体内容服务的价格</a>，但 iCloud 的数据存储层（无论是免费还是付费）<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9341083/apple-icloud-storage-plans-cheaper">自 2015 年以来一直保持不变，</a>除了最高级别。 8年！媒体订阅价格的稳步上涨令人烦恼，但可以理解。大多数用户从不增加 iCloud 的存储量会让人感到顽固和恶意。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-25"><p>我说的<em>是好</em>节目，<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/business/media/jon-stewart-the-problem-ends.html">不是所有节目</a>。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-25"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-10-25"><p>如果你滚动浏览<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111196532299204839">我在 Mastodon 上的帖子的</a>回复，你会看到一些人建议我之所以收到这样的底部广告，是因为我必须关闭“个性化广告”在“设置”→“隐私与安全”→“苹果广告”中。但我已经<em>打开了</em>个性化广告，并且已经打开了很长一段时间。这些都是苹果在 Apple News 上的<em>好</em>广告。我实在是太贪吃惩罚了，我实际上很想关掉个性化广告，看看广告是否会变得更糟。 <a href="#fnr2-2023-10-25"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 苹果再次提高媒体服务价格</title></entry><entry><title>WatchOS 10.1 现已支持双击手势，适用于 Series 9 和 Ultra 2 手表</title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-watch-double-tap-gesture-now-available-with-watchos-10-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/25/double-tap-watchos-10" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40307</id><published> 2023-10-25T17:21:53Z</published><updated> 2023-10-25T17:21:54Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/spooktacular-apple-event-on-halloween-eve/">丹·莫伦，《六种颜色</a>》：</p><blockquote><p>将此视为我以前从未见过的事情：<em>晚上</em>的苹果活动。该公司周二宣布将于太平洋时间 10 月 30 日星期一下午 5 点举办“Scary Fast”活动。</p><p>正如<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-mac-launch-event-coming-october-30-or-31/">彭博社马克·古尔曼（Mark Gurman）本周末报道的</a>那样，人们普遍预计这次活动将推出新款 Mac：这笔钱似乎是在更新的 24 英寸 iMac 上，不过也可能会发布其他产品。</p></blockquote><p> Broadcasting an event at 8pm ET / 5pm PT is new, but we&#39;re still relatively early in the era of pre-recorded keynotes. Unusual to say the least — makes me wonder if there&#39;s some other shoe to drop that will make the timing make sense.</p><p> If it&#39;s the iMac, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the upgrade is to the M2, not the M3. Gurman reported that the iMac would skip the M2 and go straight to the M3, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-26/apple-aapl-plans-iphone-14-apple-watch-series-8-m2-macs-for-2022-and-2023-l4vd5unx">that report was all the way back in June <em>2022</em></a> :</p><blockquote><p> Outside of the Mac and iPad Pro, there&#39;s another place I expect the M2 to appear: Apple&#39;s mixed-reality headset. I&#39;m told the latest internal incarnations of the device run the base M2 chip along with 16 gigabytes of RAM. [...]</p><p> Apple is also already at work on the M2&#39;s successor, the M3, and the company is planning to use that chip as early as next year with updates to the 13-inch MacBook Air code-named J513, a 15-inch MacBook Air known as J515, a new iMac code-named J433 and possibly a 12-inch laptop that&#39;s still in early development.</p></blockquote><p> He was correct about the Vision Pro using the M2 — and remember, that was a full year ahead of it being announced — but it doesn&#39;t feel right to me that the M3 chip would debut in the iMac. Gurman has also pointed out that MacBook Pros — both the not-really-all-that-“pro” 13-inch model, and the truly-pro 14- and 16-inch models — are in short supply at the moment, with mid-November shipping dates for most configurations. But it just feels too early for the M3 Pro/Max chips to start shipping, when the A17 Pro — the chip the M3 is presumably based on — only started shipping last month. Given what I&#39;ve heard about TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability — particularly obtaining wafers — I think their hands are full just producing A17 Pro chips for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p><p> So I&#39;m just guessing here, but I&#39;m thinking this event might be about iMacs only, with an upgrade to the M2, and maybe some design changes — like, say, fresh colors. It&#39;d be a lot more fun if it&#39;s the debut of the M3, but my spidey sense says that&#39;s not happening yet.</p><p> <em>Also</em> : It would sort of feel awkward to start launching $1,300 M3-based iMacs (or $1,000 iPad Pros) months ahead of the $3,500 Vision Pro, which will have the M2. It feels natural to me that M3-based Macs and iPads will only launch <em>after</em> the Vision Pro, so that when the Vision Pro is announced, the M2 is still the “current” Apple silicon generation.</p><p> <em>But</em> : The event is named “Scary Fast”, so maybe it <em>is</em> about the debut of the M3 series? I still don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have the M3 Pro/Max chips ready, but maybe it&#39;s a refresh across the line for all the Macs that use the regular M2 (and in the iMac&#39;s case, M1)?</p><p> So it looks like Gurman is going to beat Ming-Chi Kuo in the “are new Macs coming this year?” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Thunderdome face-off</a> , but it&#39;s fun that no one seems to know what exactly is coming.</p><h2> Postscript</h2><p> OK here&#39;s a spitball idea that fits all the puzzle pieces together:</p><ul><li> Regular 24-inch iMacs get upgraded to the M2.</li><li> These new iMacs might also be the source for those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">purported color-matched braided USB-C cables</a> that were assumed to be for the iPhones 15. All iPhone 15 models ship with plain white braided cables, but the existing M1 iMacs shipped with fun color-matched Lightning cables.</li><li> New “pro” iMacs are launched, with the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, like the ones in the current 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros (which only debuted early this year). Maybe these hypothetical iMac Pros will have bigger displays too? 27 inches would match both the Studio Display and the old Intel-based “big” iMacs.</li></ul><p> M2 Pro and Max iMacs would justify “Scary Fast” in a way that just plain M2 iMac speed bumps would not. This would still allow the Vision Pro to launch “early next year” while the M2 remains the current Apple silicon generation. And this would fit with the scuttlebutt that TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability is, for the near future, almost entirely dedicated to keeping up with demand for the iPhones 15 Pro.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple to Broadcast &#39;Scary Fast&#39; Event Next Monday Night</title></entry><entry><title> The End of iTunes? </title><link href="https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/apple-is-finally-killing-off-itunes-for-real-this-time/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40305</id><published> 2023-10-24T17:33:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-25T23:42:42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Kirk McElhearn, writing at The Mac Security Blog:</p><blockquote><p> While some can cast aside the accumulated goodwill of a brand name on a whim, Apple doesn&#39;t like to do so. Even after splitting the iTunes app, Apple retained the iTunes Store name for selling digital content. You access the iTunes Store in the Music app on the Mac to buy music, and the iPhone and iPad still have iTunes Store apps. But there is some overlap: you can buy and rent movies, for example, in both the iTunes Store and TV apps, as Apple tries to shift purchases to the latter.</p><p> Soon, all that will be left of the iTunes brand is the iTunes Store for music. And people buy much less music [than] in the past, having mostly shifted to streaming. Will the iTunes name finally fade away as music sales dwindle? It&#39;s hard to imagine Apple stopping digital music sales entirely; even if fewer people buy digital music, the market isn&#39;t dead, not by a long shot. Global digital music sales peaked in 2012 at around $4.4 billion, and in 2021 they had dropped to $1.1 billion. That&#39;s a decline of about 75%, but Apple still earns a hefty amount of money from selling digital music.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been wondering about the same thing for a few years. I purchase/rent all my movies and TV shows on my Apple TV, where “iTunes” isn&#39;t mentioned. (And in the age of streaming, I really only purchase/rent movies — the TV shows I watch are all streamed nowadays.) So why keep the iTunes Store app around on iOS — they could just add a Store tab to the Music app. Buy your music — if you buy music — in Music, and buy your movies in TV.</p><p> The only reason I can think not to do this is that the Music app is already so jam-packed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The End of iTunes?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/24/mcelhearn-end-of-itunes">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/apple_and_ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3j" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40303</id><published> 2023-10-23T22:33:57Z</published><updated> 2023-10-27T00:37:50Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">Speaking of</a> Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">he has an interesting bit about Apple&#39;s AI efforts in his latest Power On column</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The company has some catching up to do. Apple largely sat on the sidelines when OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT took off like a rocket last year. It watched as Google and Microsoft Corp. rolled out generative AI versions of their search engines, which spit out convincingly human-like responses to users&#39; queries. Microsoft also updated its Windows apps with smarter assistants, and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled an AI-enhanced overhaul of Alexa.</p><p> All the while, the only noteworthy AI release from Apple was an improved auto-correct system in iOS 17.</p></blockquote><p> I would argue that the improved autocorrect in iOS 17 is a major feature — in my use it&#39;s clearly an improvement, and autocorrect is a feature used every day, in almost every app, by almost every iOS user. It&#39;s one of the most used and most important features in the entire OS. I&#39;d also argue that Apple has done some terrific work with AI features in Photos. The search feature in Photos works <em>really</em> well.</p><p> But I think Gurman&#39;s summary does get at an essential truth. If I asked you “Which companies are at the forefront of AI-powered products?”, I doubt you&#39;d put Apple on the list. And AI is proving so useful — and yet is a nascent field — that Apple needs to soon be on that list, lest their products begin to fall behind competitively. “Which companies are best at integrating AI into products?” is going to be like “Which companies are best at creating hardware at scale?” and “Which companies are best at human interface design?”</p><p> Gurman continues:</p><blockquote><p> Now, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook says that Apple has been working on generative AI technology for years. But I can tell you in no uncertain terms that Apple executives were caught off guard by the industry&#39;s sudden AI fever and have been scrambling since late last year to make up for lost time.</p><p> “There&#39;s a lot of anxiety about this and it&#39;s considered a pretty big miss internally,” a person with knowledge of the matter told Power On.</p><p> As I first reported in July, the company built its own large language model called Ajax and rolled out an internal chatbot dubbed “Apple GPT” to test out the functionality. The critical next step is determining if the technology is up to snuff with the competition and how Apple will actually apply it to its products.</p></blockquote><p> What I have heard from little birdies in Cupertino is <em>not</em> that there was a miss on this already. Apple is almost never at the forefront of stuff like this. They&#39;re a deliberate company. Their goal, as with any new technology, is to integrate it into products in meaningful ways <em>best</em> , not <em>first</em> . That&#39;s why there&#39;s no internal anxiety that they&#39;ve already missed anything related to AI.</p><p> The anxiety inside Apple is that many people inside do not believe Apple&#39;s own AI/ML team can deliver, but that the company — if only for privacy reasons — will only use what comes from its own AI/ML team.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple and AI</title></entry><entry><title> Kolide — Device Trust for Okta </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40304</id><published> 2023-10-23T22:30:00Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T22:39:26Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is chock-a-block with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: drafting emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk: malware, data governance, and prompt injection attacks.</p><p> Kolide is taking a two-part approach to governing AI use: allowing you to draft AI policies <em>as a team</em> , and using Kolide to block malicious tools. <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Rumor Pundit Thunderdome </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/no-new-macs-or-ipads-expected-rest-of-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40302</id><published> 2023-10-23T18:16:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T18:16:54Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors on Friday:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</p><p> Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.</p><p> Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a> , ruling out an update to the all-in-one desktop computer this year. All other desktop Macs, including the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, were already updated in 2023 and are highly unlikely to be updated again until 2024 or later.</p></blockquote><p> But then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">here&#39;s Hartley Charlton on the latest from Mark Gurman</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple is planning a Mac-focused product launch, likely including the announcement of a refreshed 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> , for the end of this month, Bloomberg&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">Mark Gurman reports</a> .</p><p> In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p">“Power On” newsletter</a> , Gurman said that Apple is “planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month” that could see the the release of a refreshed 24-inch iMac model, which is long overdue a hardware update. The current model launched in April 2021 and it is the only current-generation Mac left with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip. Gurman has repeatedly said that Apple&#39;s next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/">iMac will skip the M2</a> and feature the M3 chip instead, but he declined to mention which chip the new machine will feature in this newsletter.</p><p> Gurman noted that Apple retail stores are now in short supply of the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and many configurations now will not arrive until mid-November, in what he believes is “a clear sign that something is about to happen” regarding these three machines.</p></blockquote><p> Claim chowder tastes great with a side of popcorn.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Rumor Pundit Thunderdome’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/apple-rumor-pundit-thunderdome">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> YouTube Music Is Now Available Natively on HomePods </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/youtube-music-integration-comes-to-homepod/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/homepod-youtube-music" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40301</id><published> 2023-10-23T17:46:17Z</published><updated> 2023-10-23T17:48:19Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick, MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> YouTube Music is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9231765?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;oco=1#zippy=%2Capple-homepod">now available</a> directly on Apple&#39;s HomePod and HomePod mini, thanks to new Siri integration support in the YouTube Music app. The change means subscribers to the streaming service can now choose to use voice commands to start YouTube Music on a HomePod, without having to append “on YouTube Music” to every request.</p></blockquote><p> Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s support document for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/use-siri-to-play-music-on-homepod-apd3399d3179/homepod">using Siri to play music on HomePods</a> , which includes the (pretty simple) directions for setting a default music service.</p><p> There&#39;s a big — and to me, a little weird — difference between music services and streaming video services. Every streaming video service is available on almost every device capable of playing video. Whatever box or built-in “smart TV” software you&#39;re using in your living room, it almost certainly has access to every major streaming video service. When Apple TV+ launched in 2019, Apple already supported Samsung TVs, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">pre-announced versions for Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony, and Vizio</a> .</p><p> But with these smart audio devices, it&#39;s been more drip-by-drip. It seems clear that each of the major smart audio device makers — Apple with HomePod, Amazon with Alexa, and Google with their Nests — originally conceived of them as being companion products for the respective company&#39;s own music service, not open platforms. You can see how they&#39;d think that way: most people subscribe to multiple streaming video services, because each service has its own original shows and movies. But with music, most people subscribe to just one service, because each service pretty much has all popular music.</p><p> But in the long run it&#39;s better for everyone to do what&#39;s best for users, and clearly that means giving users a choice of which music service they want to use, no matter which hardware system they&#39;ve bought. Compete on quality and price, not lock-in.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘YouTube Music Is Now Available Natively on HomePods’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/23/homepod-youtube-music">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Alexa Fell for 2020 Election Crackpottery </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/07/amazon-alexa-news-2020-election-misinformation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/22/alexa-2020-election-crackpottery" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40300</id><published> 2023-10-22T17:38:39Z</published><updated> 2023-10-22T17:41:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica:</p><blockquote><p> An advertising industry group urged Comcast to stop its “10G” ads or modify them to state that 10G is an “aspirational” technology rather than something the company actually provides on its cable network today. The National Advertising Division (NAD), part of the advertising industry&#39;s self-regulatory system run by BBB National Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged by T-Mobile.</p><p> In its decision <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g">announced</a> Thursday, the NAD recommended that Comcast “discontinue its &#39;10G&#39; claims” or “modify its advertising to (a) make clear that it is implementing improvements that will enable it to achieve &#39;10G&#39; and that it is aspirational or (b) use &#39;10G&#39; in a manner that is not false or misleading, consistent with this decision.”</p><p> Comcast plans to appeal the decision, so it won&#39;t make any changes to marketing immediately. If Comcast loses the appeal and agrees to change its practices, it would affect more than just a few ads because Comcast now calls its entire broadband network “10G.”</p></blockquote><p> This is absolutely hilarious.

<p>Charlie Gile and Katherine Doyle, reporting for NBC News from Atlanta:</p><blockquote><p> Trump campaign legal adviser Kenneth Chesebro struck a deal with prosecutors from the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney&#39;s office in its 2020 election interference case on Friday.</p><p> Chesebro, who was charged alongside Donald Trump and more than a dozen other codefendants with attempting to delay the transfer of power after the 2020 election, was scheduled to stand trial this week. He accepted the offer as jury selection was underway on Friday, after 450 potential jurors had completed a lengthy questionnaire on what would be asked.

<p>Joseph Simonson in The Washington Free Beacon, “NYU Law Students Say Classmate Losing Job Offer Over Pro-Hamas Statement Is &#39;Violence&#39;”:</p><blockquote><p> New York University law students are rallying behind a student who lost a spot at a white-shoe law firm for defending Hamas, saying the firm&#39;s decision to rescind their offer constitutes “violence.”</p><p> The Chicago-based Winston &amp; Strawn withdrew its offer of employment to Ryna Workman after the nonbinary NYU student issued a statement claiming “Israel bears full responsibility” for the terrorist attacks that have left more than 1,300 dead, including at least 30 Americans. The firm&#39;s decision is just one instance of “systemic, concentrated violence” Workman has experienced since issuing her anti-Israel pronouncement, according to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STpCTTPP2xLTyTJdFmHqxftF0jPb6jl30S_-ozqbdC4/edit">letter</a> of support obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.</p><p> The letter&#39;s signatories, which include the Black Allied Law Students Association and the Women of Color Collective, accuses NYU of being complicit “in the abuses of the Israeli government,” and condemns “the broader NYU administration for not protecting Ryna as a student and important member of our community.”</p></blockquote><p> Words have meaning. The far left has been mangling the definition of <em>violence</em> for years now, inverting the age old adage that sticks and stones can break your bones but words will never hurt you.

We&#39;d be in a far better place if the only exchanges between Gaza and Israel were words, no matter how hateful those words be.</p><p> These students should be expelled from college, not placated. Misusing <em>violence</em> in this context — a terrorist attack that has killed 1,300 innocent Israelis, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-biden/card/latest-death-toll-in-israel-hamas-conflict-vGjRIHmG7vlGZUdBE5hn">maimed many thousands more</a> , and killed thousands of Palestinians in the resulting still-unfolding war — is outrageously offensive. Many of the dead can&#39;t be identified. They&#39;ve just been blown apart. That&#39;s violence. Everyone knows <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violence">what the word really means</a> — “the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy”.

<p>I&#39;ve surfaced this 2013 gem from Forbes before, but it feels worth another link in light of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">that new Piper Sandler survey</a> pegging the iPhone&#39;s market share amongst US teens at a staggering 87 percent:</p><blockquote><p> Ultimately, in the eyes of today&#39;s youth, massive popularity has watered down Apple&#39;s coolness. “Teens are telling us Apple is done,” says Tina Wells of the youth marketing agency Buzz Marketing Group. “Apple has done a great job of embracing Gen X and older [Millennials], but I don&#39;t think they are connecting with Millennial kids. [They&#39;re] all about Surface tablets/laptops and Galaxy.”</p></blockquote><p> This take looks really goofy 10 years later, but at the time, there was a really strong, persistent media narrative that Apple couldn&#39;t thrive without Steve Jobs, and that Samsung in particular was going to surpass them. 2013 was the year of Phil Schiller&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple">Can&#39;t innovate any more, my ass</a> ” ad lib during the WWDC keynote.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Vintage 2013 Claim Chowder: ‘Is Apple’s iPhone No Longer Cool to Teens?’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/claim-chowder-iphone-cool">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Color Palettes From Dieter Rams Products for Braun </title><link href="https://www.presentandcorrect.com/blogs/blog/rams-palette" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v3b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/rams-palette" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40295</id><published> 2023-10-18T23:46:38Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T23:46:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/apple-announces-new-apple-pencil-with-magnetic-storage-and-usb-c-port/">Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This pencil is clearly designed for use with the tenth-generation iPad: while it attaches magnetically to the long edge of the iPad for storage, it still charges via a physical port. Unlike the old Lightning model, which had a removable (and easily lost) cap hiding its charging and pairing connector, the new Apple Pencil features an innovative sliding design that reveals a USB-C port into which you can plug a cable (which, naturally, is <em>not</em> included). Its design is otherwise very similar to the second-generation Pencil.</p><p> At $79, this Pencil is cheaper than both the first-generation model at $99 and the second-generation model at $129. But that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t have all the features of <em>either</em> of them: it lacks the pressure sensitivity of either of the previous models, as well as the double-tap controls, wireless pairing and charging, and free engraving of the second-generation. However, the new Pencil <em>does</em> support the “hover” feature on M2 iPad Pro models.</p></blockquote><p> On the one hand, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUWA3AM/A/apple-pencil-usb-c">this new Pencil</a> makes complete sense. Lightning is quickly fading away, and this new slider seems like a much better design than the old cap. On the other hand, though, the fact that there are now <em>three</em> Apple Pencil models, all with different features and which are supported by different iPads, exemplifies just how over-complicated the iPad product lineup is.</p><p> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/the-price-of-apples-old-products-strategy/">Jason Snell hits that point in his own take</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Still, it&#39;s hard to look at the shenanigans in the iPad product line over the last few years and not get the sense that things are kind of a mess. This new Pencil should&#39;ve shipped last year with the 10th-generation iPad. The new iPad has features that higher-end models don&#39;t. There&#39;s insufficient differentiation between the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. (Leaving old models aside, it just feels like there are too many iPads, doesn&#39;t it?)</p><p> It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re witnessing a reset, however. There hasn&#39;t been a single new iPad announcement this year, and given Tuesday&#39;s Apple Pencil announcement, it sure feels like there won&#39;t be one. Perhaps 2024 will bring us a new wave of iPads that will finally make the product line make more sense. But don&#39;t get your hopes up too much: Apple will probably still keep selling some old models, too. It&#39;s what today&#39;s Apple does.</p></blockquote><p> Off the top of my head, what I&#39;d like from Apple on the iPad front next year:</p><ul><li> Drop the old 9th-gen iPad from the lineup. That iPad is so old it still has a home button.</li><li> Lower the price of the 10th-gen iPad by $100. (And maybe give it a speed bump from the A14 to A15 chip? But it&#39;s probably wishful thinking to hope for a price cut <em>and</em> a newer chip.)</li><li> Update the iPad Air (and Mini?) models to be more like today&#39;s iPad Pros, with Face ID instead of Touch ID. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-18"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-18">1</a></sup></li><li> Major revision of the iPad Pros, which haven&#39;t seen a major form factor change since 2018. Put more <em>pro</em> in the iPad Pros, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video">just like Apple has done</a> with the iPhone 15 Pro models.</li><li> Update the Magic Keyboard, ideally in a way that continues to support both iPad Airs and 11-inch iPad Pros. The Magic Keyboard is a great idea, and I think a popular one. But it ought to be better — thinner, lighter, and more durable. (The white ones especially age quickly. Keep your eyes out for them in the wild, in cafes and airports — they often look quite grungy. Compare and contrast with MacBooks, which often look great even after years of daily use.) <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-magic-keyboard-aluminum-laptop/">Mark Gurman has reported</a> that just such a revision to the Magic Keyboard is in the works.</li></ul><p> That would clarify the iPad&#39;s three tiers: good (regular iPad, 10th-gen), better (iPad Air — the best choice for most people), and best (iPad Pros, with advanced new features and capabilities). The point should be to make the question “ <em>Which iPad should I buy?</em> ” as easy to answer as possible. I think Apple <em>has</em> made that question pretty easy to answer for iPhones, MacBooks, and Watches — and for peripherals like AirPods. <sup id="fnr2-2023-10-18"><a href="#fn2-2023-10-18">2</a></sup> Now do it for iPads.</p><p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol></p><p><li id="fn1-2023-10-18"><p> It feels like a very safe assumption that the issue here is cost: Face ID components are expensive, so the non-Pro iPads are saddled with Touch ID buttons instead. I&#39;m sure there are many happy iPad Air owners who aren&#39;t bothered by Touch ID. But if you&#39;ve ever used an iPad Pro with Face ID, it&#39;s impossible not to be annoyed when using an iPad Air. Face ID isn&#39;t just a different form of bio-authentication than Touch ID, it a clearly superior one. When I&#39;ve reviewed them, it&#39;s been a large focus of my attention. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_ipad_air">From my year-ago review of the current iPad Air</a> :</p><blockquote><p> For <em>me</em> , Face ID alone is worth $150. I use my iPad in a Magic Keyboard frequently, perhaps even a majority of the time. It&#39;s my kitchen computer. And I find using Touch ID on the power button somewhat awkward when the iPad Air is in the Magic Keyboard. But the Magic Keyboard is a $300 peripheral. It&#39;s not a niche product but it&#39;s certainly not for everyone. iPads are fundamentally handheld tablets, and handheld, the iPad Air&#39;s Touch ID instead of Face ID is much less of a difference. I still decidedly prefer Face ID, though. Touch ID on the iPad Air makes it feel easy to unlock. Face ID on the iPad Pro makes it seems like it wasn&#39;t even locked in the first place.</p></blockquote><p> With iPhones, Face ID is now in every model they sell but the SE. That&#39;s how it ought to be for iPads too: in every one of them but the price-focused entry model. It&#39;s too good of a feature, and a key advantage for iPads when compared to MacBooks. <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p><p></li></p><p><li id="fn2-2023-10-18"></p><p> The one weird MacBook is the 13-inch MacBook Pro. From a purely logical perspective, I don&#39;t think Apple should even sell that device. The M2 MacBook Air is cheaper, lighter, and equally capable. Study <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Air-M2,MacBookPro-13-M2,MacBook-Pro-14-M2">Apple&#39;s tech spec comparison page for 13/14-inch MacBooks</a> and it&#39;s hard to find a reason to recommend the 13-inch MacBook Pro. But I do think it sells surprisingly well. My theory is that there&#39;s a segment of the market that would be served better by the MacBook Air but who believe that they need a “Pro” MacBook. The specs don&#39;t matter to them — it&#39;s the name. Or maybe there are a surprising number of Touch Bar fans out there? <a href="#fnr2-2023-10-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎</a></p><p></li></p><p></ol></div></p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ There&#39;s a New Apple Pencil With a USB-C Port, and My Thoughts Turn to the Complexity of the Overall iPad Lineup </title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v39" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/10/kolide_--_device_trust_for_okt_5" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40293</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-10-18T22:06:08Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T22:06:08Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>It seems like every company is scrambling to stake their claim in the AI goldrush — check out the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/the-ceo-of-kroger-mentioned-ai-8-times-on-the-company-s-earnings-call#xj4y7vzkg">CEO of Kroger promising</a> to bring LLMs into the dairy aisle. And front line workers are following suit–experimenting with AI so they can work faster and do more.</p><p> In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is overflowing with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: punching up emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk.</p><ol><li> <strong>Malware:</strong> Security researchers keep uncovering <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/beware-ai-scams-meta-blocks-1000-plus-links-tied-to-chatgpt-themed-malware">AI-based extensions</a> that steal user data. These extensions play on users&#39; trust of the big tech platforms (“it can&#39;t be dangerous if Google lets it on the Chrome store!”) and they often appear to work, by hooking up to ChatGPT et al&#39;s APIs.</li><li> <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Companies including Apple and Verizon have banned their employees from using LLMs because these products rarely offer a guarantee that a user&#39;s inputs won&#39;t be used as training data.</li><li> <strong>Prompt Injection Attacks:</strong> In this little known but <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">potentially unsolvable attack</a> , hidden text on a webpage directs an AI tool to perform malicious actions–such as exfiltrate data and then delete the records.</li></ol><p> Up until now, most companies have been caught flat-footed by AI, but these risks are too serious to ignore.</p><p> At Kolide, we&#39;re taking a two-part approach to governing AI use.</p><ol><li> <strong>Draft AI policies as a team.</strong> We don&#39;t want to totally ban our team from using AI, we just want to use it safely. So our first step is meeting with representatives from multiple teams to figure out what they&#39;re getting out of AI-based tools, and how we can provide them with secure options that don&#39;t expose critical data or infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>Use Kolide to block malicious tools.</strong> Kolide lets IT and security teams write <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3PJW32Q">Checks that detect device compliance issues</a> , and we&#39;ve already started creating Checks for malicious (or dubious) AI-based tools. Now if an employee accidentally downloads malware, they&#39;ll be prevented from logging into our cloud apps until they&#39;ve removed it.</li></ol><p> Every company will have to craft policies based on their unique needs and concerns, but the important thing is to start now. There&#39;s still time to seize the reins of AI, before it gallops away with your company&#39;s data.</p><p> To learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">click here to watch an on-demand demo</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta.

<p>Notable results from Piper Sandler&#39;s survey of over 9,000 US teenagers:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p> 70% of teens have used Spotify over the last six months (up from 68%), with 46% of teens opting to subscribe/pay for Spotify (up from 44%)</p></li><li><p> TikTok improved slightly as the favorite social platform (38% share) by 80 bps vs. spring &#39;23. SNAP was No. 2 with 28% share, followed by Instagram (23%)</p></li><li><p> Teens spend 28.7% of daily video consumption on Netflix (-220 bps vs. spring &#39;23) and 29.1% on YouTube (+100 bps vs. spring &#39;23)</p></li><li><p> 87% of teens own an iPhone; 88% expect an iPhone to be their next phone; 34% own an Apple Watch</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> The iPhone&#39;s market share among US teenagers has been remarkably high for as long as I can remember such surveys. Years ago, though, there was a split between how many teens actually <em>had</em> an iPhone vs. how many wanted one for their next phone. Now those numbers are effectively even. I suspect this is the primary driving force in the iPhone&#39;s continuing market share growth in the US It&#39;s easy to think only short-term and believe that just about everyone who might ever get a phone already has one, but there are teenagers (and pre-teens) getting their first phone <em>every</em> day.</p><p> That teens spend slightly more time every day watching video on YouTube than on Netflix isn&#39;t surprising, at least if you&#39;ve observed any teens recently. But it&#39;s rather remarkable given how different their business models are. Netflix spends a veritable fortune on new original content and old library content. YouTube content is mostly uploaded from users and content creators <em>for free</em> .</p><p> I&#39;d be curious to know if there&#39;s a noticeable split between which devices teens use to watch video on different services. Like, maybe YouTube viewing skews more toward watching on their iPhones, but Netflix on bigger-screen devices like laptops and iPads? TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram are surely viewed almost entirely on their iPhones.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Piper Sandler’s Annual ‘Taking Stock With Teens’ Survey’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/piper-sandler-taking-stock-with-teens">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Log Is the “Pro” in iPhone 15 Pro&#39; </title><link href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v37" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/maschwitz-iphone-15-pro-log-video" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40291</id><published> 2023-10-18T21:40:45Z</published><updated> 2023-10-18T21:40:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> When a customer buys a new iPhone from an Apple retail store, the device sometimes comes with outdated software. For instance, the first iPhone 15 models out of the factory shipped with iOS 17, but iOS 17.0.1 was already available by the time the devices were available for purchase. Buying a new iPhone without the latest software isn&#39;t ideal, especially if there are some high-profile bugs. But that situation is about to change.</p><p> Apple is planning a new system for its retail stores that will update the software on iPhones prior to sale. The company has developed a proprietary pad-like device that the store can place boxes of iPhones on top of. That system can then wirelessly turn on the iPhone, update its software and then power it back down — all without the phone&#39;s packaging ever being opened. The company aims to begin rolling this out to its stores before the end of the year.</p></blockquote><p> Fascinating idea, but I have so many questions. What exactly is the trigger here? Something related to MagSafe? When the system is put into place, will it work with existing still-in-the-box iPhones or will it only work with <em>new</em> units, that ship from the factory running iOS 17.2 or whatever? Will the same system eventually come to other products, like iPads and Apple Watches? Maybe even Macs?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gurman: Apple Is Readying System to Apply Software Updates to Still-in-Box iPhones’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/gurman-inbox-software-update">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iMazing 3: Coming Soon </title><link href="https://imazing.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=imazing3beta&amp;coupon=FIREBALL-IMAZING3" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v35" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/15/imazing-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40289</id><published> 2023-10-15T22:23:40Z</published><updated> 2023-10-15T22:23:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly malfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the tech was up and running — showing an image of three iPhones, each demonstrating a part of the phone&#39;s setup process. Cue squinted down at the screen.</p><p> “The resolution on this is terrible,” he said. “You should get a Mac.” That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, “If Apple would like to make a donation…” That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business.</p></blockquote><p> Genuinely funny, and genuinely an Eddy Cue moment.</p><blockquote><p> Meagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he would have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn&#39;t agree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he&#39;d never really considered that an option: “I always felt like it was in Google&#39;s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.” Cue also argued that the deal was about more than economics and that Apple never seriously considered switching to another provider or building its own search product. “Certainly there wasn&#39;t a valid alternative to Google at the time,” Cue said. He said there still isn&#39;t one.</p></blockquote><p> Here we get to the heart of the matter. Say what you will about alternatives like Bing and DuckDuckGo (which is powered by Bing results), but they are — I say — at least “valid” alternatives to Google for web search. I&#39;ve been using Kagi — <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/plan-types.html">a paid search engine with plans starting at $5/month</a> — for about a year and there&#39;s no question in my mind that I&#39;m getting as good or <em>better</em> results than I do from Google for the overwhelming majority of my searches. Apple <em>could</em> switch, quality-wise. Whether they could switch and maintain any semblance of the profits they reap from their deal with Google, I do not know.</p><p> So as Google&#39;s search result quality deteriorates — but their ability to monetize their search monopoly remains strong — Apple looks bad too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Eddy Cue in Court, Defending Apple’s Lucrative Search Deal With Google’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/12/cue-apple-google">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> President Biden on the Terrorist Attacks in Israel </title><link href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cho6JtMTYXg" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v33" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/11/biden-israel" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40287</id><published> 2023-10-11T17:59:47Z</published><updated> 2023-10-11T18:03:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>John Kelly, writing for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The ad was for a Whopper Jr. promotion. The conceit was that you could get two of the baby burgers for a mere $5: one for you and one for a friend. But — spoiler alert! — you&#39;d probably want to consume the pair yourself. Or, as the text on the screen put it:</p><p> JK YOU<br /> ATE &#39;EM<br /> BOTH</p><p> I grabbed my remote, rewound, paused and took a photo. This was the Zapruder film to me, even if the JK stood for “Just kidding,” not “John Kelly.”</p><p> This must not stand, or — to keep with the theme — it mustn&#39;t stand.</p></blockquote><p> This sort of mistake drives me nuts, and I spot such wrongly-curled apostrophes instantly. To me it&#39;s as glaring a mistake as a misspelled word. So god bless Kelly for griping about it in a column in The Washington Post. (I&#39;d argue that perhaps it&#39;s correct for Burger King to use the wrong apostrophe, as a signifier of the care with which they prepare their food.)</p><p> But Kelly doesn&#39;t mention the obvious explanation for how this happens: automatic smart quote algorithms that aren&#39;t smart enough, in the hands of ignorant designers who don&#39;t have an eye for typography. If you type:</p><pre> <code>&#39;em&#39; dashes and &#39;en&#39; dashes</code></pre><p> you want the apostrophe before <em>em</em> to be an opening single quote, the one shaped like a 6 in most typefaces. But if you type:</p><pre> <code>screw &#39;em</code></pre><p> you want the apostrophe preceding the <em>em</em> to be a closing single quote, the one shaped like a 9. The various “smart quotes” algorithms you get while typing aren&#39;t smart enough to make this contextual distinction — even <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">very good ones</a> — so you need to do it by hand.

<p>Dan Moren, also at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> That second agent proved quite capable, not only agreeing that the situation was strange, but also looking into issues on Apple&#39;s side. Which led to the somewhat bizarre conclusion of this story: after perhaps 20 minutes on the phone, he seemed to hit on something. I heard him laugh and say something along the lines of “that explains it” and then, with my consent, put me on hold. When he came back, he said — and I&#39;m not exactly quoting, but close enough: “I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t tell you any more than this, but all your services should be back up pretty much exactly 12 hours after they went down.” [...]</p><p> So I waited the rest of the day. At this point, I had received no email since the early morning, and a number of my other apps — though not all — were non-functional. It made me realize just how much of my life was dependent on Apple&#39;s online services — a somewhat sobering proposition.</p><p> I spent the next few hours largely offline, but kept an eye on the clock. And, sure enough, at 9pm on the dot, everything flipped back on: all my Find My friends showed up, my email started slowly trickling in, and I was able to finally fully log back into my iCloud account on my MacBook Air — just in time to go to bed.</p></blockquote><p> What a strange and maddening situation.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Black Box of iCloud’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/moren-icloud-black-box">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jason Snell Reviews the iPhones 15 Pro </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/review-iphone-15-pro-pro-max/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/snell-iphones-15-pro" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40281</id><published> 2023-10-09T22:28:23Z</published><updated> 2023-10-09T22:28:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> I recently went to a football game (it was a beautiful day in Berkeley, California) and was trying to figure out where my wife had gone — we were separately looking for concessions amid the rattle and hum of a busy stadium walkway. Then I remembered we both had new iPhone 15 models, and I opened Find My — the app that lets you find all that you can&#39;t leave behind — and enabled the remarkable new UWB-powered feature that lets you find nearby friends.

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it. The user chooses when to restart, but if they don&#39;t fix the problem by a predetermined deadline, they&#39;re unable to authenticate with Okta.</p><p> <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Watch Kolide&#39;s on-demand demo</a> to learn more about how it enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/09/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Snopes Shows the Folly of X&#39;s New Link Presentation </title><link href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/musk-biden-transgender-died/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/snopes-twitter" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40279</id><published> 2023-10-07T00:52:54Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T17:11:30Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Another change this week at Twitter/X: they&#39;ve stopped showing the headline for links in tweets. Jordan Liles, writing at Snopes under the splendid headline “Did Elon Musk Endorse Biden, Come Out as Transgender, and Die of Suicide?”:</p><blockquote><p> On Oct. 5, 2023, a user on X named Armand Domalewski posted that the social media platform&#39;s owner, Elon Musk, had announced his endorsement of US President Joe Biden for a second term in the White House. “Elon Musk endorses Joe Biden for re-election,” the post read alongside a picture of Musk smiling.</p><p> However, this news was not true. Domalewski had created the <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmandDoma/status/1709827419031691620">post</a> ( <a href="https://archive.ph/yIIJG">archived</a> ) as somewhat of a satirical example of a recent decision made by X that removes visible headlines from posts that contain links.</p><p> The link in the post, which was only displayed as “Fortune.com,” led to an <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/21/elon-musk-plans-remove-headlines-news-articles-link-shared-on-x-twitter/">article</a> with a headline that could only be read if users visited the website. That headline: “Elon Musk plans to remove headlines from news articles shared on X.”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693843680904216619">Musk&#39;s stated reason</a> for the change: “Will greatly improve the esthetics.”</p><p> This justification, as Liles&#39;s piece at Snopes exemplifies, is of course nonsense. Either show the full preview card, including the original site&#39;s headline, or don&#39;t show anything except the original URL. That&#39;s the way Twitter worked for years: the full URL itself was visible in the tweet. But Twitter is now showing neither the original headline nor the URL, just the domain name of the source, along with the URL&#39;s preview card <em>image</em> .</p><p> Clarity, in all things, is the height of aesthetic achievement. The best link presentation is the one that makes it the most clear where it will take you. What X is presenting today is obfuscating, not clarifying, and thus grotesque.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Snopes Shows the Folly of X’s New Link Presentation’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/snopes-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> X Rolls Out New &#39;Chumbox&#39; Ad Format — Post-Like Things That Can&#39;t Be Reported or Blocked </title><link href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-x-new-clickbait-ad-format" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/06/x-chumbox" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40278</id><published> 2023-10-07T00:33:11Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T00:33:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Speaking of Sebastiaan de With, Lux — makers of Halide — have a new app out:</p><blockquote><p> Orion is a small, fun app that helps you use your iPad as an external HDMI display for any camera, video game console, or even VHS. Just plug in one of the bajillion inexpensive adapters, and Orion handles the rest.</p></blockquote><p> More fun than what Orion does is how it does it: with flair and character. You even have to “unbox” it on first launch. It&#39;s genuinely perplexing to me how this just-for-the-sake-of-fun style of UI design has fallen so out of favor. Apple went flat and no-nonsense with iOS 7 all the way back in 2013, and the rest of the world went flat and no-nonsense ever since. That was an entire decade ago! Maybe it&#39;s just wishful thinking on my part, because I personally crave a return to depth and texture and whimsy in UI design, but the pendulum has to swing back toward skeuomorphism eventually. Orion is definitely a step back in the direction of that ethos.</p><p> (It&#39;s not all gimmickry either — Orion&#39;s CRT emulation modes should make retro video games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puksg4iD3RY">look much more like how they were originally intended to look</a> .)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Orion: Use an iPad as an External HDMI Display’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/orion">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sebastiaan de With&#39;s iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera Review </title><link href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-15-pro-max-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2q" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/sdw-iphone-15-pro-max" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40274</id><published> 2023-10-05T23:23:15Z</published><updated> 2023-10-07T23:43:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sebastiaan de With:</p><blockquote><p> I will not quit until I have shown you an inordinate amount of comparisons between the main camera and its new, long 5× telephoto counterpart. Not because it&#39;s just fun to see how much it zooms, but also to show you how differently you have to look at the world around you. [...]</p><p> This has a funny psychological effect: once I shoot at 5× for a while, the Main lens feels... wider somehow. I&#39;ve had to double-check a few times if I am not accidentally shooting at 0.5×. I suspect that this is what led to Apple adding the 28- and 35mm “lenses” to the camera — once you are going between such extreme ranges, the change is just a bit jarring.</p><p> Is it a great lens?</p><p> It is, hands down, the sharpest telephoto lens Apple has ever shipped. “Of course!”, you could argue. “Why wouldn&#39;t it be? It&#39;s 2023 and technology gets better. Why wouldn&#39;t it be sharper than the last one?”</p><p> Well, it&#39;s a long lens. It is truly remarkable how nicely this new lens captures detail <em>despite that length</em> .</p></blockquote><p> Illustrated with dozens of terrific photos. I had a similar experience testing the 15 Pro Max&#39;s 5× lens: it requires an entirely different way of looking at the world.

<p>One interesting sidenote from Farsace&#39;s review: She attempted to shoot <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832">4K/60 ProRes video</a> , recording directly to an external SSD over USB, but she inadvertently did so using a USB-C cable that doesn&#39;t support USB 3 data transfer speeds, so the footage was captured at a terribly low frame rate. The first problem is that USB-C cables are <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/12/03/usbefuddled-untangling-the-rats-nest-of-usb-c-standards-and-cables/">a confusing mess</a> when it comes to data transfer and high speed charging capabilities.

<p>The Verge, as usual, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup/">has a wonderful page summarizing everything announced or demoed at yesterday&#39;s Pixel event</a> , including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00uU6PdTjKE">a 15-minute summary video</a> . The Verge is so good at things like this, I dare describe them as indispensable.</p><p> At the highest level it&#39;s impossible not to draw a direct comparison to Apple&#39;s iPhone 15 event last month. The two companies announced the exact same slate of products:</p><ul><li> New flagship phones, both Pro and non-pro</li><li> New smartwatches</li><li> New wireless earbuds with AR noise filtering features</li></ul><p> New phones, new watches, new earbuds. The Apple and Google versions of these products are all direct competitors to each other. No normal person buys both an iPhone and a Pixel, or both an Apple Watch and Pixel Watch, or both AirPods Pro and Pixel Buds Pro. But it&#39;s more profound than that. Practically speaking, no one mixes and matches these products. Why would anyone? If you own an iPhone, it&#39;s hard to think of a single reason why you&#39;d try to pair it with a Pixel Watch or Pixel Buds. And if your phone is a Pixel, you <em>can&#39;t</em> even pair it with an Apple Watch.</p><p> As I wrote about Apple&#39;s event last month, these three product categories go together. They form an ecosystem of truly personal computing devices: the ones we take with us nearly everywhere, which work together in ways that just don&#39;t apply to other devices. There are zillions of people who own the Apple triumvirate — iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods — who use a PC laptop and something other than an Apple TV box for streaming. And there are surely plenty of Android users who use a MacBook. A Mac <em>can</em> be a great device for use in Google&#39;s overall ecosystem.</p><p> It&#39;s also impossible not to comment on just how much less interest there is in Google&#39;s Pixel ecosystem. Google&#39;s event garnered only a sliver of the attention Apple&#39;s did, and their devices, similarly, have only a fraction of the sales Apple&#39;s do. On the one hand I&#39;m tempted to say the difference is just commensurate with how much better at hardware Apple is than Google. But I think there&#39;s more to it than that. There&#39;s something ineffable about it. There are aspects of marketshare traction — in any market — that can&#39;t be explained by side-by-side product comparisons alone.</p><p> For a long time, Apple just couldn&#39;t regain traction in the PC market. Even after Mac OS X was released, even after the Jobs/Ive regime had restored both <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/04/the-mac-product-grid/">sense</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808948/imac-twenty-five-visual-history-apple-design-models">panache</a> to the hardware lineup, it seemed like the best Apple could do was tread water, marketshare-wise. But they kept at it. We remember the long-running “Get a Mac” ad campaign with Justin Long (“I&#39;m a Mac”) and John Hodgman (“and I&#39;m a PC”) not just because it was clever but because it really did coincide with a reversal of fortune for the Mac in the market. People really did start switching from Windows PCs. So great was Windows&#39;s market share that here we are 17 years after the start of that ad campaign and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/apples-mac-market-share-jumped-even-though-pc-sales-fell-for-the-sixth-consecutive-quarter.html">the Mac continues to grow</a> .</p><p> Are Google&#39;s Pixel devices — the phones especially — ever going to have such a moment? I just don&#39;t see it happening. Most tellingly, they don&#39;t even take much share of the US <em>Android</em> market, let alone the US smartphone market, let alone the worldwide phone market. Here&#39;s 9to5Google, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/28/google-pixel-us-q2-2023-shipments/">reporting back in July regarding a market share report from Counterpoint</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Through that, though, Apple actually managed to up its share of the overall US smartphone market in Q2 2023 by 10%. That takes the iPhone to a 55% share of overall shipments, with Android brands competing for the remaining 45%. Apple has had higher numbers prior, hitting 57% in Q4 of last year, but there&#39;s still a clear trend where Android is continuing to lose ground.</p><p> However, Google Pixel managed to be a bright spot throughout. Pixel shipments in the US grew by 48% year-over-year in Q2, the only major brand that managed to do so. That&#39;s still a mere 3% of shipments over the quarter, but that&#39;s also during a time where only a single Pixel device actually launched.</p></blockquote><p> 3 percent market share in the US — Pixel&#39;s best market — is a pretty dim “bright spot”. I don&#39;t know how anyone could compute this, other than anecdata observed in Mountain View cafeterias, but I&#39;d wager that more Google employees carry an iPhone than carry a Pixel. There was a trend on Threads last week where — inspired by Linda Yaccarino showing the world that she didn&#39;t have the X app on her iPhone&#39;s home screen — people were showing screenshots of their own home screens. It struck me, watching them scroll by, just how many people have multiple Google apps among their most-used iOS apps — Maps, Gmail, Chrome. That&#39;s a sign of strength for Google, as a company, but it&#39;s obviously a hindrance to getting iPhone users invested in Google&#39;s overall ecosystem to switch their phone to a Pixel. The best software from Google is available on all phones; the best from Apple is only available on iPhones. <sup id="fnr1-2023-10-05"><a href="#fn1-2023-10-05">1</a></sup></p><p> Something is just missing from the Pixel&#39;s potential appeal, and I don&#39;t think it was announced yesterday. I really am glad that Google seemingly remains committed to its Pixel devices, but I just don&#39;t see the angle that&#39;s going to change their popularity. I suspect I could save this column and publish it a year from now instead of today, and barely change a word.</p><hr /><p> The most striking features Google announced yesterday were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup/">regarding AI-assisted photography</a> . “Magic Editor” lets you move and remove objects and people. “Best Take” is a feature I&#39;ve long wished for yet still feel uneasy about: if you snap multiple photos of a group of people, Best Take will choose the “best” face for each person from the group of images, merging them into a single, well, best take. For decades we&#39;ve all been able to do this manually using Photoshop and other image editors, and merging multiple image captures into a single resulting “photo” is how features like HDR work. But Google seems more willing to brush aside any ethical concerns about what exactly a <em>photograph</em> is. On Threads, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/Cx-3qcLrQH8">Nilay Patel wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google is framing its new AI camera tools as making “memories” not photos which... run this to the end and it&#39;s just a camera designed to tell lies about what really happened. I don&#39;t know that any news organization can accept journalistic photos from a Pixel 8 at this point.</p></blockquote><p> The difference from something like HDR is that even if HDR is generating one image from multiple sensor readings, the purpose is to more accurately reflect what the photographer&#39;s eyes actually saw, from that vantage point, at that moment in time. Pixel phone photography is racing ahead to a world where images reflect moments that never actually were. Is the purpose of a camera to capture things as they were, or as they should have been?</p><p> Is that dishonest? Is all of digital photography headed in this direction, inevitably, and Google is just willing to blaze the trail that everyone else will soon enough follow?我不知道。 But it was the segment of yesterday&#39;s event that most struck me: technically impressive, but ethically blithe.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-10-05"><p> Try this on for an analogy: Google treats its entire Pixel portfolio like Apple treats Apple TV hardware. They make the best parts of it available on other platforms, greatly reducing the perceived value of their own hardware.

Why switch to an Apple TV box when the TV app and iTunes Store are built into your “smart” TV? <a href="#fnr1-2023-10-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Google&#39;s Pixel 8 Launch Event </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/overheatgate_nothingburger" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2g" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40264</id><published> 2023-10-01T17:28:49Z</published><updated> 2023-10-03T16:52:45Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Blaming it on the new titanium frame was just wild speculation on Kuo&#39;s part, and by all evidence is *completely wrong*. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>On Tuesday, Ming-Chi Kuo published a short post under the headline “ <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/the-iphone-15-pro-series-overheating-issues-are-unrelated-to-tsmcs-advanced-3nm-node-iphone-15-5f354b1ab155">The iPhone 15 Pro Series Overheating Issues Are Unrelated to TSMC&#39;s Advanced 3nm Node</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> My survey indicates that the iPhone 15 Pro series overheating issues are unrelated to TSMC&#39;s advanced 3nm node. The primary cause is more likely the compromises made in the thermal system design to achieve a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency. It&#39;s expected that Apple will address this through software updates, but improvements may be limited unless Apple lowers processor performance. If Apple does not properly address this issue, it could negatively impact shipments over the product life cycle of the iPhone 15 Pro series.</p></blockquote><p> That was the whole post. The post clearly implies that iPhone 15 Pro models have a design flaw related to their titanium frame that leads to overheating, and that since the flaw is related to the hardware design, Apple will be forced to throttle the CPU and GPU, and thus sales of the 15 Pro models will suffer.</p><p> Kuo is very influential, and thus his report <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=aapl+price+sept+25+to+29+2023">drove Apple&#39;s stock price down noticeably</a> . Kuo&#39;s influence stems not from his intuition but from his sources, but that&#39;s the problem with an allegation like this one. Kuo&#39;s narrative gained enough traction that Apple has issued a statement, repeated in its entirety below:</p><blockquote><p> We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected. The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity. We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update. Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We&#39;re working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.</p></blockquote><p> Not only is the titanium frame of the iPhone 15 Pro models <em>not</em> an issue, cooling-wise, but Apple told me — and I have no reason to doubt — that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are <em>better</em> at heat dissipation than any previous iPhone that used a stainless steel frame (iPhone X, XS, and 11–14 Pro). There is absolutely nothing wrong — and in fact much that is good — with the heat dissipation of the titanium frame, and Apple has no plan to in any way throttle the A17&#39;s performance. They have bugs to fix in iOS 17, that is all.</p><p> It&#39;s long been true that iPhones sometimes get warm/hot during the first few days after setup (or complete restore): all sorts of large libraries (like Photos) get synced in the background, and all sorts of on-device processing takes place. There are also often performance-related bugs in the first release of the major new iOS version each fall — and per Apple&#39;s statement, this year is no exception.</p><p> As for the problematic third-party apps, one of them is Instagram, which has apparently just this week released a version fixing a bug that was so egregious that it was burning through iPhones&#39; battery life at a rate of 1 percent/minute just sitting idle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6X2ZIkYFsQ">YouTuber Faruk “iPhonedo” Korkmaz posted a video this week</a> showing the buggy version of Instagram heating two different iPhones to 100°F: one an iPhone 15 Pro, the other a year-old iPhone 14 Pro. Exact same overheating issue. (I question here why iOS allows any app to consume so many resources that it makes the device too hot to hold comfortably, but the bug was apparently Instagram&#39;s. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">Same too with Uber</a> . Real shocker that two apps made with a Frankensteinian mishmash of web and native UI toolkits would run amok, resource-wise.)</p><p> Ming-Chi Kuo obviously has some remarkable sources within Apple&#39;s Asian supply chain. But he&#39;s still sometimes <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">very wrong</a> . And — unlike Mark Gurman — Kuo&#39;s sources seemingly never come from within Apple itself. His post on this overheating issue is almost transparently a leak from TSMC — a sort of “ <em>Whatever is going on with the iPhone 15 Pro heat dissipation, it has nothing to do with our 3nm process</em> ”. Blaming it on the new titanium frame was just wild speculation on Kuo&#39;s part, and by all evidence is <em>completely wrong</em> .</p><p> If Kuo has any respect for accuracy or truth, as I&#39;m sure he does, he&#39;ll issue a full retraction.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ iPhone 15 OverheatGate Seems to Be a Nothingburger</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
