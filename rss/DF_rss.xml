<p>Ming-Chi Kuo，9月15日（星期日）</p><blockquote><p>根据我的最新供应链调查和苹果官方网站的预订结果，我在iPhone 16的每种型号的第一周预订上编制了关键数据，包括预订销售，平均交货时间和预订之前的货物。 [...]</p><p>分析和结论：</p><p> iPhone 16系列的第一周期预订销售估计约为3700万台，比去年的iPhone 15系列第一周年销售额下降了约12.7％。关键因素是对iPhone 16 Pro系列的需求低于预期。</p></blockquote><p>请注意，iPhone 16阵容的预订仅<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/get-ready-to-upgrade-to-the-new-iphone-16-apple-watch-and-airpods-lineups/">在9月13日（星期五）</a>前两天开始。这是Kuo对第一周期预订销售的估计，将同比的iPhone 15型号逐年比较：</p><p><table class="table-96B8661B-2F34-48B3-80A8-CA76E29911A6" width = 200><style>

<p>诺拉·德利格特（Nora Deligter），于2023年6月为屏幕板岩撰写“<a href="https://www.screenslate.com/articles/elegy-screenshot">屏幕截图</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>大约五年前，凯瑟琳·皮尔森（Catherine Pearson）开始拍摄<em>保姆</em>（1993  -  1999年）中每束式屏幕截图，这是六个季节的CBS情景喜剧，然后在Netflix上流媒体。她只是成为一名花店，她发现了安排 - 华丽，丰富多彩且明显的热带乐趣。现在，她将它们保留在桌面上的文件夹中，以及<em>Poirot</em> （1989-2013）（英国侦探戏剧）上的花卉布置屏幕截图。然而，几个月前，皮尔森突然发现，当她的手指本能地朝着命令档3舞时，她被一个黑匣子打招呼，她的花朵过去曾经是她的花朵，这是她本来要捕捉的东西的审查版本。</p><p>大约在这个时候，Netflix，HBO Max，Amazon Prime等流媒体平台在屏幕截图上施加了一个安静的禁运。起初，有解决方法：用户可以通过使用浏览器勇敢或下载扩展名或Fireshot（例如Fireshot）来继续屏幕截图。但是逐渐地，数字权管理技术适应并变得更加复杂。如今，几乎不可能从最受欢迎的流媒体服务中屏幕截图，至少不是在Macintosh计算机上。 [...]</p><p>对于PC用户，这个故事需要不同，更快乐的转弯。通过使用剪切工具 -  Microsoft Windows独有的实用程序，用户可以免费从所有流平台筛选获取内容。这似乎是一个尖锐的疏忽，在流媒体中，由于其假定的文化阶级而排除了Mac用户（尽管它们占市场的一小部分）。这个假设不是不合理的。在接受本文采访的每个人中，只有一个是PC用户。</p></blockquote><p>自从她在2023年出版以来，Deligter的文章就坐在我<a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/03/01/dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage-right-now/">的</a>漫长（且不断增长的）<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages">列表</a>中。</p><p>我不确定这是什么技术答案，但是在MacOS上，它似乎涉及GPU和视频解码硬件。这些DRM停电发生在如此低的水平上，以至于没有高级软件（您可能会安装的任何实用程序）可以围绕它们路由。我认为Windows仍然可以轻松地从DRM视频中轻松屏幕截图，这并不是因为流媒体服务不在乎Windows用户的工作（考虑到Windows的市场份额，当您想到它时，这将是一件奇怪的事情，<em>而不是</em>关心Windows的市场份额），而是因为Windows使用了不太复杂的成像图像管道。或者也许不是不那么<em>复杂的</em>，更准确地说<em>整合的整合</em>是更准确的。这些DRM停电在Apple设备上（您无法从iPhone或iPad上的DRM视频中捕获屏幕截图）通过OS和硬件之间的深入集成启用，从而使停电在硬件级别上强加。而且，我认为流媒体服务首先使用DRM“保护”他们的视频外，也没有选择进入此屏幕截图禁令。如果视频受到DRM保护，则无法屏幕截图；如果不是，您可以。</p><p>在Mac上，曾经是DRM视频在Safari中的屏幕捕获中被遮盖的情况，而不是在Chrome（或数十种铬衍生的浏览器）中进行的。但是在几年前的某个时候，<em>默认情况下</em>，您也不再能够从Chrome的DRM视频中捕获屏幕截图。但是在Chrome的设置页面中，在系统下，如果您禁用“可用时使用图形加速度”，并且重新启动Chrome，Boom，则可以在Chrome窗口中筛选所有内容，包括DRM视频。您可以在切换此设置之前和之后转到Magic URL <code>chrome://gpu/</code>以查看有关差异的完整报告 - 如您所期望的那样，它关闭了所有用于视频编码/解码，组合等的硬件加速度。您不想一直这样浏览（当然不是电池电量），但是对于从视频中捕获静止图像，这是一个很好的技巧。</p><p>我不明白的是，为什么Apple首先会为硬件加速视频而烦恼（这都是iOS平台上的视频 - 没有解决方法，例如在iPhone或iPad上使用硬件加速度使用硬件加速度）。没有人会创建一个由DRM保护的视频创建的盗版副本。 MacOS和iOS中的这种“功能”并不像盗版DRM保护的视频内容结束了。这个“功能”对包括流媒体服务在内的任何人都没有实现任何价值，但对诚实的人施加了巨大的（对于大多数人来说，令人困惑和令人沮丧），只是试图轻松捕获高质量的人（而不是用他们该死的手机拍摄他们的反射性笔记本电脑展示的照片）。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★为什么我们不能从Apple设备上的DRM保护视频中筛选帧？</title></entry><entry><title>马修·格林（Matthew Green）：&#39;亲爱的苹果：立即向iMessage添加“消失的消息”&#39; </title><link href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/03/01/dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage-right-now/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w49" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41625</id><published> 2025-03-01T20：06：10Z</published><updated> 2025-03-02T18：14：23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>亚历克斯·希思（Alex Heath），报道了《边缘：》：</p><blockquote><p>发言人说，梅塔（Meta）解雇了“大约20”的员工，他们泄露了“公司外部机密信息”。</p><p>元发言人戴夫·阿诺德（Dave Arnold）专门告诉《边缘》：“我们告诉员工何时加入公司，并提供定期提醒，无论意图如何，我们的政策违反了我们的政策。” “我们最近进行了一项调查，导致大约有20名员工被终止，以分享公司外部的机密信息，我们希望会有更多。我们认真对待这一点，并在确定泄漏时继续采取行动。”</p></blockquote><p>当然，这些射击是我今年迄今为止我最喜欢的头条新闻之一的后续行动：“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/meta-warns-leakers-in-leaked-memo">元警告说，它将消除泄漏备忘录的泄漏者</a>”。正如我一个月前在那篇文章中写的那样：</p><blockquote><p>这并不担心被解雇会使大多数公司的员工无法泄漏。这是他们发现自己与公司的使命保持一致。他们觉得自己想看到成功的团队，并且自然会采取成为团队合作者的态度。团队合作者不会泄露剧本，因为他们不喜欢教练的戏剧打电话或他们获得多少比赛时间。我从来没有感觉到这种态度存在于元中。</p></blockquote><p>我不确定这种公众镇压会有所帮助。梅塔似乎倾向于使员工保持一致，而不是团队精神。他们对泄漏者的战争可能与<a href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/four-decades-counting-continued-failure-war-drugs">美国数十年来的“毒品战争”</a>一样有效，即即使我们的监狱填补了非暴力的毒品法律罪犯，这种非法使用毒品的使用也不会<em>下降</em>。 Leia公主是什么？ “塔尔金越拧紧抓地力，恒星系统就越会滑过手指。”一位在Netflix工作的长期读者在我一个月前的帖子后与我联系并观察到：</p><blockquote><p>这是对元泄漏的绝佳意义。 Netflix的东西几乎永远不会泄漏，因为Netflix是一个不想泄漏事情的人的地方。几乎没有障碍，只是一种不这样做的文化和集合。</p></blockquote><p>处罚是威慑。但是，大多数人不犯罪的原因（无论是在购物还是谋杀）不担心潜在的处罚。这是他们不想偷窃的好诚实的人（绝对不想杀死任何人）。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“元元素驱动了大约20”员工以泄漏”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-fires-leakers">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>框架介绍了新的笔记本电脑和第一台台式机</title><link href="https://frame.work/blog/highlights-from-the-framework-2nd-gen-event" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w45" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/framework-introduces-new-laptops-and-first-desktop" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41621</id><published> 2025-02-28T22：39：22Z</published><updated> 2025-02-28T23：08：44Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

  /></a></p><p> iPhone 16e看起来像是一部手机，背面带有微型相机。 iPhone 16 Pro看起来像是一部恰好是手机的相机。您也确实可以感觉到手头上的差异 - 不仅是体重，而且平衡。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-26">1</a></sup>您可以感觉到16个Pro的额外相机硬件增加了额外的重量。根据苹果的规格，iPhone 16e重167克； 16 Pro 199g  - 差异16％。 （还要注意一个聪明的触摸：苹果的每个手机的默认壁纸，巧妙地表明它们拥有多少个相机镜头。）</p><p> 16e相机镜头并没有与手机的背面冲洗，但是它很少（按我的尺寸为1.7毫米）突出，以至于它可以回到iPhone摄像头<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">刚开始从手机后面伸出的</a>时候。 16e在桌面上放置时仍会摆动，但比常规iPhone 16或尤其是iPhone 16 Pro的摄像机模块显得差不多。但是16e的1.7毫米相机镜头的突起是如此之最小，以至于在案例中，手机<em>确实</em>完全平放在桌子上，因为盒子不需要保护镜头，因为16e相机镜头的突出小于壳体的厚度。 （苹果在<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD3P4ZM/A/iphone-16e-silicone-case-white">39美元的硅胶盒</a>中包括我的评论套件中的两个，蓝色和黑色。它们很好，感觉就像苹果的通常有机硅盒一样。）</p><p>由于最近的常规和Pro iPhone型号上的“宏”模式使用了0.5×Ultrawide摄像头，因此16E没有次级镜头，因此16E没有宏模式。<a href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-macro-camera-a-big-day-for-small-things/">从iPhone 13 Pro开始</a>，宏模式使iPhone Pros可以专注于小于一英寸的物体。但是，由于16e的1倍相机的传感器比更昂贵的iPhone型号上的1×相机具有较小的传感器和较小的镜头，因此它能够以较短的距离进行焦点，而不是那些更大，更好的1×相机。 iPhone 16 Pro上的1倍摄像头的最小聚焦距离为24厘米（〜9.5英寸）。 iPhone 16e上的1×相机的最小聚焦距离为12厘米（〜4.75英寸）。实际的宏模式（在常规iPhone和Pro iPhone型号上）更好，但是当16e的孤独相机可以在常规拍摄模式下，只需4英寸以上的距离，就不需要太多。</p><p>当然，16e的不起眼的相机具有价格：图像质量。您确实可以看到弱光的差异。 16E相机的速度较慢（导致具有运动中的受试者的模糊图像），并且图像更嘈杂。当<a href="https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">卤化物中的过程为零时，在</a>低光中拍摄时，差异尤其明显。不过，这是一个很好的相机，出于刻痕目的。对于大多数可能正在考虑使用iPhone 16e的人，它可能是他们拥有的最好的相机。而且，只有一个镜头的简单性，提供1×和2倍的视野，就有话要说。如果您知道什么是ƒ停车，则可能不应该购买iPhone 16e。如果您不知道什么是ƒ停车，则可能不会注意到iPhone 16甚至16 Pro的相机质量有任何差异。对于只想要一个体面的相机的任何人来说，这是一个完美的相机。</p><h2>缺少的是：magsafe，晋升和超宽带（以及，其他超宽带）</h2><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16-pro,iphone-16,iphone-16e">仔细阅读Apple的比较页面</a>，将16E与16个Pro和常规16进行比较，您会发现数十个小差异。但是，一个遗漏吸引了最大的关注（并产生了最“ WTF Apple？”反应）是Magsafe。我拥有一堆Magsafe外围设备，而没有它，个人就不会购买iPhone。我的桌子上有<a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-carbide">一个码头</a>（<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-standby-iph878d77632/ios">备用模式</a>很棒），<a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger">床头柜上的充电器</a>，以及像<a href="https://www.moft.us/products/case-stand-wallet-snap-set?variant=39411246989399">这种磁性折叠台</a>这样的方便的doodads。使用16e作为我的主要手机的一周，我仍然像第一天晚上一样想念Magsafe。</p><p>但是据苹果代表称，16e目标受众中的大多数人专门将手机插入充电电缆中。他们倾向于根本不使用电感充电，而当他们这样做时，他们可能不在乎16e被pokey 7.5W QI充电速度粘住，而最近更昂贵的iPhone在15W甚至25W时通过Magsafe充电。对我来说，这不是我最想念的高充电速度。这是捕获的位置。 <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-26">2</a></sup>我认为苹果比我更了解16e的预期受众。大胆的火球读者不在16e人群中；是DF读者的朋友和家人。</p><p>典型的低端iPhone买家关心哪些功能？他们想要一部看起来不错的手机，具有良好的显示屏，不错的相机和较长的电池寿命。他们是否在乎16e仅支持Wi-Fi 6，而不是7？不，因为他们的想法为零，Wi-Fi版本号甚至是什么意思。他们只是认为Wi-Fi是Wi-Fi。他们是否关心Verizon（又称“ Ultra宽带”）的SuperSpeed MMWave 5G网络？不。他们只是希望他们的细胞连接快速而牢固。 （我来自Apple的评论单位在AT＆T蜂窝连接上暂时固定，整个星期都很牢固。</p><p> The iPhone 16e also omits <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109021">the <em>other</em> “ultra wideband”</a> , the chip Apple uses for precise location detection — like tracking an AirPod to within a foot.精确发现非常酷，当您真正被诸如钥匙扣之类的丢失物品​​所困扰时，非常有帮助。 Ultra wideband has been included on all new iPhones other than the SE (and now 16e) since the iPhones 11 in 2019. From a nerd&#39;s perspective, it really does seem like a curious omission from the 16e five years later. But how many people in your extended family know what “ultra wideband precision finding” is?</p><p> To date, only Apple&#39;s iPhone Pro models have supported ProMotion — Apple&#39;s marketing name for a display that features adaptive refresh rates that go up to 120 Hz and down to 1 Hz for the “Always On” display mode. Given that the regular iPhone 16 (and 16 Plus) don&#39;t support ProMotion, there was zero chance the 16e would. There are mid-range Android phones with high-refresh-rate displays, but (a) I don&#39;t think they&#39;re <em>better</em> displays, all things considered, and (b) they&#39;re mid-range Android phones. It&#39;s like bragging about the refresh rate on the dashboard display in a Kia Sorento. The 16e display also sports a throwback notch in lieu of the fancier, more playful, and at times cleverly useful, dynamic island.</p><p> The iPhone 16e targets the “I only care about the basics” iPhone buyer: the screen looks good, the camera is good but simple, the battery lasts a long time (the difference should be quite striking for anyone upgrading from a four- or five-year-old iPhone), it runs all their existing apps, and it charges fast when plugged into a USB cable. Those are the basics, and the basics are all that casual users care about. That it&#39;s lighter in weight and physically smaller thanks to its minimally protruding single camera lens is gravy.</p><h2>定价</h2><p>The only aspect of the 16e garnering more discussion than its omission of MagSafe is its starting price of $600 for a 128 GB base model. “It should cost $100 less” say some people, who tend to be the same people who <em>also</em> strongly believe it should include MagSafe and a ProMotion display. Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s current iPhone lineup, plus the discontinued (but <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022.html?q=iphone%20se">still</a> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-se-3rd-generation-64gb-unlocked-black/6507470.p?skuId=6507470">available</a> from <a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/prepaid-phones/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022-64gb-midnight">some</a> carriers) 3rd-generation SE: </p><table class="table-7940E2A4-0011-4258-A4DA-D506F80A4F67" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The new 16e starting at $600 makes more sense than the old SE starting at just $430. $600 is clearly the next logical “rung” under the year-old iPhone 15&#39;s $700 starting price. Complaining that Apple no longer makes a phone that&#39;s priced in the $400-500 range is like complaining that BMW no longer makes any cars that cost less than $40,000. They&#39;re Apple. It&#39;s an iPhone. Of course it costs more than a no-name Android phone, or the 27th model down the ladder in Samsung&#39;s sprawling product lineup. Anyone who wants to spend less than $600 for an iPhone can buy one from the flourishing pre-owned/refurbished market — just like buying a BMW for under $40,000.</p><p> The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don&#39;t want to think much about their phone. But they <em>do</em> want an iPhone, not just any “whatever” phone. A just plain iPhone, with a good screen, good enough (and simple) camera, and great battery life. I think Apple nailed that with the iPhone 16e.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-26"><p> There&#39;s a decided <em>feel</em> difference with the side rails of the 16e too.

<p>Joseph Menn, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The US Justice Department told Congress in November there were no major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies seek data from each other&#39;s communication companies.</p><p> But at that time, officials knew British authorities were preparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users&#39; encrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department matters. [...]</p><p> The department said it reminded its British counterpart of the CLOUD Act&#39;s “requirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not create any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data.” The report did not mention the looming order, and said any demands for reduced security would come under Britain&#39;s Investigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the CLOUD Act.</p><p> On Wednesday, Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, faulted the November certification, saying “it splits the finest of hairs” by suggesting that the CLOUD Act didn&#39;t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit on the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of Congress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating the Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple&#39;s encryption.</p><p> Two of the people familiar with the certification process said the FBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United States and would have been in a stronger legal position to win that if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for another government.</p></blockquote><p> Just utterly disgraceful behavior from the Biden administration — choosing to look the other way at a clear violation of the CLOUD Act to help their purported buddies in the UK, at the direct expense of a US company&#39;s autonomy and US citizens&#39; privacy. I don&#39;t see how this dissembling can be defended.

<p>Zac Hall, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> According to a letter seen by 9to5Mac, the Trump Administration is investigating whether the UK may have broken a bilateral agreement when secretly demanding that Apple build a global backdoor into iCloud.</p><p> Trump&#39;s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote in a letter responding to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona that she was not made aware of the UK&#39;s secret demand by her UK counterparts. However, she suggested, the UK government may have broken a bilateral privacy and surveillance agreement in making the demand.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2025/02/DNI-Wyden-Biggs-Response-1.pdf">Gabbard&#39;s letter is available here</a> (and I&#39;m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/DNI-Wyden-Biggs-Response-1.pdf">hosting a copy</a> ). From her letter:</p><blockquote><p> Thank you for your letter dated 13 February 2025 concerning reported actions by the United Kingdom toward Apple that could undermine Americans&#39; privacy and civil liberties at risk. I am aware of the press reporting that the UK Home Secretary served Apple with a secret order directing the company to create a “back door” capability in its iCloud encryption to facilitate UK government access to any Apple iCloud users&#39; uploaded data anywhere in the world. I share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a “backdoor” that would allow access to Americans personal encrypted data. This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans&#39; privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.</p><p> I was not made aware of this reported order, either by the United Kingdom government or Apple, prior to it being reported in the media. I have requested my counterparts at CIA, DIA, DHS, FBI and NSA to provide insights regarding the publicly reported actions, and will subsequently engage with UK government officials. The UK&#39;s Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, also known as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, which I understand would be at issue, allows the UK to issue a “gag order,” which would prevent Apple or any company from voicing their concerns with myself, or the public. [...]</p><p> My lawyers are working to provide a legal opinion on the implications of the reported UK demands against Apple on the bilateral Cloud Act agreement. Upon initial review of the US and UK bilateral CLOUD Act Agreement, the United Kingdom may not issue demands for data of US citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents (“US persons”), nor is it authorized to demand the data of persons located inside the United States. The same is true for the United States — it may not use the CLOUD Act agreement to demand data of any person located in the United Kingdom.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m so pleased by Gabbard&#39;s response here, including making it public, that I&#39;m gladly willing to overlook her “back door”/”backdoor” and “UK”/”UK” inconsistencies. ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF style</a> is now to close it up: <em>backdoor</em> .)</p><p> Short of the UK backing down and retracting its secret demand for an iCloud backdoor from Apple, this is the best that Apple and privacy advocates could hope for. The gag-order aspect of the UK&#39;s Investigatory Powers Act prevented Apple from even fighting it in court. But a US ruling that would hold it illegal for Apple to comply would put Apple in an impossible situation, where they can&#39;t comply with a UK legal demand without violating the law of the home country. That would actually give Apple the ground to fight this in the UK.</p><p> It is not coincidental that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5305750/keir-starmer-trump-white-house">UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit the White House tomorrow</a> .这是一个信息事先的信息，即美国考虑了对Apple不可接受的这一需求的所有方面。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard Suggests UK Broke Agreement in Secretly Demanding That Apple Build iCloud Backdoor’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/gabbard-letter-to-wyden-and-biggs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Downie 4 </title><link href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/downie-4" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41613</id><published> 2025-02-26T22:55:58Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T23:37:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I referenced Downie twice earlier today — once in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business">my item linking to Charlie Monroe</a> (developer of Downie) writing about the indie app business, and earlier <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/ive-desert-island-discs">in my post about using Downie to download the MP3</a> from Jony Ive&#39;s interview on the BBC&#39;s Desert Island Discs.</p><p> I somehow hadn&#39;t heard of (or more likely, just hadn&#39;t noticed) Downie until a few weeks ago, when I first came across <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/">Monroe&#39;s blog post</a> , <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/01/31/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/">via Michael Tsai</a> . Here&#39;s the pitch for Downie, from its website:</p><blockquote><p> Ever wished you could save a video from the Internet? Search no more, Downie is what you&#39;re looking for. Easily download videos from thousands of different sites.</p></blockquote><p>就是这样。您可以给它一个网页URL，Downie将下载页面上嵌入的任何视频（或音频）文件。 Downie offers all sorts of convenience features, like browser extensions, post-processing, and more. But the main interface is super obvious and easy.</p><p> For years, I&#39;ve used the open source <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> command-line tool for this task (and before yt-dlp, its predecessor, youtube-dl). When I saw Downie, I thought to myself, “ <em>That looks cool, but I don&#39;t really download that many video or audio files to justify paying for a commercial app.</em> ”但是后来我拍了拍自己（象征性地），我意识到我至少应该<em>尝试</em>一下。我很高兴自己做到了。这就像使用传输代替用于安全FTP连接的命令行工具一样。 It&#39;s cool that the Mac has a Unix terminal interface and support for zillions of free and open source utilities, but the point of using a Mac is to use great Mac apps. And Downie is a great Mac app.</p><p> What I&#39;ve found over the last month isn&#39;t just that I enjoy using Downie far more than invoking yt-dlp, but that I use Downie more often than I used yt-dlp, because it&#39;s so much easier and more reliable.例如，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design">当我写有关Fox Sports在超级碗比赛中首次亮相的新Scorebug时</a>，我使用Downie下载了本月超级碗59的本地4K副本，以及两年前的超级碗57，以将Fox的新Scorebug与他们的前一个进行比较。 Local video files are easy to navigate frame-by-frame to capture the perfect screenshot; YouTube&#39;s website makes it impossible to navigate frame-by-frame.</p><p> Downie is a $20 one-time purchase (and is also included with a <a href="https://setapp.com/">Setapp</a> subscription).我只使用了一个月左右的时间，而且我<em>已经</em>觉得我从中获得了20美元的实用程序。 （我继续购买了梦露的另一个主要应用程序，也<a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute/">取消了</a>。）</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Downie 4’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/downie-4">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Charlie Monroe: &#39;A Few Words About Indie App Business&#39; </title><link href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41612</id><published> 2025-02-26T21:48:06Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T22:39:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

I cannot just take off and leave for a few days without seeing the consequences and going insane when I get back.目前，我每天收到大约100份报告。 Some are about license code issues, some are crash reports, some are Permute conversion issues, some are Downie download issues, but it all adds up to the average of the 100 reports a day.</p><p>如果我要去度假10天……您要做数学，我会回到什么。再加上您的用户不想等待10天。 Even 5 days.有些用户不愿意等待一个小时，而只是没有意识到您每天24小时不能在计算机上，并且您可能在不同的时区和睡觉。 The unfortunate thing about this is that going through the support emails in my case is something that takes about 2-3 hours a day — which is not enough to hire someone and train them. Not to mention that most of the reports actually need some technical knowledge.因此，除非我聘请另一个开发人员，否则最终，某人可以做的真正的管理工作是每天30分钟的工作。</p></blockquote><p> I wouldn&#39;t recommend never taking a complete break for anyone, but there are some businesses where <em>someone</em> needs to spend an hour-plus on certain tasks each day. If you&#39;re a one-person operation, that person is you, even while on vacation. No one gets into indie development because they look forward to doing support, either. It&#39;s the designing, programming, crafting, and refining of the apps that drives them. But it&#39;s like being a musician or comedian in some ways. For those endeavors, the grind is traveling from one city to another for gigs. Or like running a restaurant, as dramatized on <em>The Bear</em> — prep work, cleaning, procurement, reservations, food allergies, more cleaning. It never stops. For indie developers, the grind is support. (Small restaurants typically close for a day or two each week; technical support email addresses don&#39;t.) There&#39;s just always a lot of menial work involved with being a professional artist. But that&#39;s also why so many indie developers — like, seemingly, Monroe — find the endeavor worthwhile.因为艺术作品非常充实。</p><p> A while back — around 20 years ago, at the height of the “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/26/delicious-library-eol">Delicious</a> ” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/27/siracusa-delicous-library">renaissance</a> in indie development for Mac OS X — there was a developer who burst onto the scene with a deservedly very popular app. It was gorgeous and fast.它的功能比其人满为患的类别中的其他应用程序少得多，但这也是该应用程序吸引力的一部分。这就像一个运动型的小跑车，其中包括实用的轿车和卡车。 He eventually came out with a second app, and it too was popular. His apps were sort of like Panic&#39;s, aesthetically, I&#39;d say. They not only looked cool, they were well-designed from a usability perspective too. This developer, so I&#39;ve been told, spent almost no time at all on tech support from customers.我的一个朋友问他怎么可能。这个开发人员说，很容易。 When the inbox for support emails looked full, he&#39;d do a Select All, then Delete. Inbox zero.</p><p> This story has always made me laugh. It&#39;s hilarious, in a way. But ultimately it was a sign that he just wasn&#39;t cut out for the indie app business.我认为他的应用程序在2010年左右处于休眠状态并不是一个巧合，而且我没有听说过他或从15年中听说过他。他很有才华，所以如果他在其他一些业务中做得很好，也许是在一家更大的公司内部做得很好，我不会感到惊讶，那里的开发人员和设计师与客户隔离开来，而不是像印度本质上那样与他们陷入困境。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Charlie Monroe: ‘A Few Words About Indie App Business’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> xAI&#39;s Grok-3 Jumps to the Top of AI Leaderboards </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/617780/grok-3-elon-musk-ai-race-chatgpt" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/grok-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41611</id><published> 2025-02-26T19:32:29Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T23:09:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Desert Island Discs is a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/59YrnYM0Tw8J7WJ0MGKVfh7/the-history-of-desert-island-discs">remarkably long-running</a> BBC Radio interview program now hosted (or <em>presented</em> , if you will) by Lauren Laverne. The gimmick is that guests are asked to name eight songs, a book, and a “luxury item” they&#39;d take with them if stranded on a desert island, and those picks — including playing the songs — are sprinkled throughout the interview.本周的客人是乔尼·艾夫（Jony Ive），这是我遇到过的最好的采访之一。 Incredibly thoughtful and inspiring, and Laverne covers a lot of ground without ever seeming the least bit hurried.</p><p> A few highlights, from Ive:</p><blockquote><p> I think that one of the struggles I have, though, is in some ways, I think ironically, I struggle with being present in the now because I spend so much of my life in my head in the future. The way I try to understand the future is I&#39;m obsessed with the past. And so the bit that often gets missed out is right now.</p></blockquote><p>我知道那种感觉。</p><p>关于他在苹果的早年，在与史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）统一之前和史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）的回归之前，我谈到了该公司严重的财务困扰偏向对产品的看法：</p><blockquote><p>我认为当您挣扎时，目标可能只是商业问题。 I understand — I mean, if you&#39;re losing lots of money, you&#39;d like to stop losing lots of money. The problem there is it means you focus on money, and you&#39;re normally losing money because the products aren&#39;t right.从92年到97年，这是一个非常非常困难的季节。 One that I am so grateful for — but I still get the shivers sometimes.</p></blockquote><p>该段落中使用的讲述词是“正确的”。 He could have said the problem was that Apple&#39;s mid-&#39;90s products weren&#39;t “good”, but he didn&#39;t.判断他们是好是坏，这不是正确的框架。 It&#39;s that they weren&#39;t <em>right</em> .正确的主观性。 <em>Je ne Sais Quoi</em> 。 The original iMac that started Ive&#39;s long and remarkably fruitful collaboration with Steve Jobs wasn&#39;t a hit because it was good, so much as because it was so obviously <em>right</em> .</p><p> (The BBC&#39;s <a href="https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/b006qnmr.rss">podcast feed for Desert Island Discs</a> seems to run about a month behind the website, alas.

<p>迈克尔·利德克（Michael Liedtke），报道AP：</p><blockquote><p>苹果股东拒绝了试图向技术趋势趋势者施加压力，以加入总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的努力擦洗旨在使劳动力多样化的公司计划。</p><p>国家公共政策研究中心起草的<a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2025/Proxy_Statement_2025.pdf">提案</a>（<a href="https://nationalcenter.org/about/">一个自称为保守的智囊团</a>）敦促苹果遵循<a href="https://apnews.com/article/companies-diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-lawsuits-753f027bb73a1035a919482427553ea3">一系列备受瞩目的公司，</a>这些公司已从特朗普政府十字准将目前在多元化，公平和包容性计划中撤退。</p><p>经过有关反对提案的简短演讲，苹果宣布股东拒绝了它。 In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes against the measure.</p></blockquote><p> President Trump, at 8am this morning, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114070315739588346">on his own very popular social network</a> :</p><blockquote><p> APPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM. DEI WAS A HOAX THAT HAS BEEN VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. Dei走了！！！</p></blockquote><p> Needless to say, the National Center for Public Policy Research is a bunch of ding-dongs, and Trump has no idea, at all, what <a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/">Apple&#39;s actual policies and goals are for diversity</a> — he just knows he wants them gone. (And I love the photo MacRumors&#39;s Joe Rossignol chose <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/trump-on-apple-diversity-policies/">for his report on this story</a> .)</p><p> There does exist a formal world of DEI, right down to using that very acronym.将其视为<em>Dei™</em> 。尽管结果<a href="https://jabberwocking.com/does-dei-even-work/">强烈地表明它不起作用，</a>并且<a href="https://jabberwocking.com/university-dei-statements-are-a-demeaning-charade/">一些明显令人反感的教条要求</a>，但一些<a href="https://jabberwocking.com/how-is-dei-going-at-the-university-of-michigan/">大学似乎对此有所超越</a>。 But there are obvious reasons any company (or university, or organization) ought to be concerned about diversity and inclusion, in the plain sense of those words. Not just ethical “ <em>the way things ought to be</em> ” reasons, but <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">empirical studies have shown</a> that diverse organizations are more successful.</p><p> It&#39;s a spectrum.美国许多大学都位于该范围的最左边。 The Trump administration and its proponents are, clearly, at the far right of that spectrum, where they&#39;re seeking now to pressure companies into not even concerning themselves with “diversity” in the plainest sense of the word, and are scrubbing from government agencies words like “woman” and “disabled”.我过分简单地将左/右划分为一维的划分。 Trump, for example, has ushered in a very different “right” than that of, say, the Bush-Cheney era 20 years ago.但是DEI™“左”与<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/cancel-culture-illiberalism-dead/681031/">真正的自由自由语音左语的</a>左派截然不同。 Liberals object to DEI&#39;s rigidity, dogma, and performative nature;特朗普及其同伙反对实际的人类多样性和包容性。</p><p> Some big corporations, in recent years, veered pretty far to the extreme on “DEI initiatives”, and are using the current political moment <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lowes-dei-harley-davidson-john-deere-tractor-supply/">to course correct back toward</a> the (to me, sensible) center. But this course correction started long before Trump&#39;s re-election. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html">a CNBC story from December 2023</a> on Google and Meta scaling back formal DEI programs.</p><p> Apple, from my observations, has long charted its own consistent course on such matters, right down to calling their policies “Inclusion &amp; Diversity” rather than the name-brand “DEI”.苹果没有在#MeToo和Black Lives Matter Matters动作的左侧向左冲刺，因为它们不需要。因此，他们现在不需要纠正。 Apple shareholders seemingly agree.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Shareholders Resoundingly Reject Proposal to Ditch the Company’s ‘Inclusion and Diversity’ Policies; Trump Responds With His Usual Equanimity’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/apple-shareholders-reject-proposl-to-ditch-diversity-policies">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Rene Ritchie真正地谈论iPhone 16e</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5OdiEzJNgk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/25/rene-ritchie-iphone-16e" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41607</id><published> 2025-02-25T22:55:12Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T22:55:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Now he has to do it, right?”</p><p> “He is investing hundreds of billions of dollars and others, too,” Trump continued. “We will have a lot of chipmakers coming in, a lot of automakers coming in. They stopped two plants in Mexico that were ... starting construction. They just stopped them — they&#39;re going to build them here instead, because they don&#39;t want to pay the tariffs. Tariffs are amazing.”</p></blockquote><p> Apple and Tim Cook, I&#39;m sure, are pleased as pie to have today&#39;s announcement portrayed this way, as a “Trump manufacturing win”, despite the fact that it&#39;s seemingly exactly in line with the trajectory Apple&#39;s been on for US job creation since 2018, including a nearly identical announcement <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">in 2021</a> (that they largely, but <a href="https://abc11.com/post/apple-nc-east-coast-hub-on-hold-research-triangle-park-3-years-later-1-billion-project/14997218/">not entirely</a> , followed through on).</p><p> The Mexico angle rings weird to my ears, though. Bloomberg picked up on that too, running a headline over the weekend that read “ <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tim-cook-meeting-trump-220006653.html">Trump Says Cook Shifting Apple Manufacturing From Mexico to US</a> ”.</p><p> The last thing I remember Apple having assembled in Mexico were a small number of late model Apple Extended Keyboard II&#39;s in 1995 (which were <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II">inferior to their American-made models</a> , like the one I&#39;m using to write this). It&#39;s quite possible I&#39;m overlooking some Mexican-made Apple products in the intervening decades, but if there are any, they&#39;re not recent. So I suspect Tim Cook, in his meeting with Trump last week, sold him a bill of goods, and more or less convinced Trump that Apple <em>had</em> been planning to commission some new plants in Mexico (a country so loathsome <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco">Trump confiscated their gulf</a> ) but, thanks to President Trump&#39;s inspiring leadership, Apple would instead be building those plants right here in the US, in the big old red state of Texas — when in fact all of this is pretty much exactly what Apple had been planning to do all along.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Mission Accomplished: Trump Likes Apple’s Plan, Especially the Part About Mexico That I Don’t Think Was Real’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/mission-accomplished">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>苹果宣布计划在未来四年内在美国花费超过5000亿美元（这可能正是他们一直在计划做的事情） </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41603</id><published> 2025-02-24T20:23:36Z</published><updated> 2025-02-25T01:43:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p>苹果今天宣布了有史以来最大的支出承诺，计划在未来四年内在美国支出和投资超过5000亿美元。</p></blockquote><p> The context of making a big deal over this announcement, of course, is that Apple is seeking exemptions from the Trump administration&#39;s tariffs. $500 billion is a lot of money, even for Apple, and 20,000 new jobs over the next four years is a lot of jobs, especially at a time when many big tech companies are laying off, not hiring. (The federal government is trying to lay off a lot of employees too, if you haven&#39;t heard.) But <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-earmarks-500-billion-for-u-s-expansion-19ca11a0">as the WSJ notes in their story on this announcement</a> , those 20,000 new jobs are a continuation of their existing hiring growth: “The company, which had 164,000 full-time equivalent employees as of September, has added an average of 5,400 annually over the past five years.”</p><p> Apple announced a similar plan four years ago — $430 billion and 20,000 jobs. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">In the announcement of that 2021 plan, Apple said</a> , “Over the past three years, Apple&#39;s contributions in the US have significantly outpaced the company&#39;s original five-year goal of $350 billion set in 2018.”</p><p> So I don&#39;t think this announcement is bullshit, at all. But I also don&#39;t think <em>what</em> Apple has announced today is much, if any, different from what they&#39;d be doing if Kamala Harris had gotten 1–2 percent more of the vote in a handful of states in November. The difference is that everyone is looking for quid pro quo with President Transactional back in office.</p><p> Apple again:</p><blockquote><p> As part of its new US investments, Apple will work with manufacturing partners to begin production of servers in Houston later this year. A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.</p><p> Previously manufactured outside the US, the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&amp;D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.</p></blockquote><p> Kind of interesting that the big manufacturing news is a product that Apple doesn&#39;t even sell, but produces only for its own use. I don&#39;t <em>think</em> this is a hint that they might begin selling servers ( <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/05/apple-discontinues-xserve-only-available-until-january-31st/">again</a> ), but who knows? I also wonder whether there&#39;s a corporate-espionage security angle to assembling these servers here, rather than in China.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces Plan to Spend More Than $500 Billion in the U.S. Over the Next Four Years (Which Is Probably Exactly What They’ve Been Planning to Do)’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>惠普添加了电话支持电话15分钟的等待时间</title><link href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/20/hp_deliberately_adds_15_minutes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41602</id><published> 2025-02-24T17:59:57Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T18：49：42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Paul Kunert, reporting for The Register last week:</p><blockquote><p> HP Inc is trying to force consumer PC and print customers to use online and other digital support channels by setting a minimum 15-minute wait time for anyone that phones the call center to get answers to troublesome queries. The wait time was added on Tuesday, February 18, according to internal communications seen by The Register, and impacts retail patrons in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, though we anticipate more countries could be added.</p><p> On the fifth, tenth, and thirteenth minute, the recorded message will tell HP customers it is “experiencing longer waiting times and we apologize for the inconvenience,” and again remind them they may switch to alternatives.</p></blockquote><p> Three days later, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/21/hp_ditches_15_minute_wait_time_call_centers/">HP reversed the new policy</a> , issuing this bullshit statement:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re always looking for ways to improve our customer service experience. This support offering was intended to provide more digital options with the goal of reducing time to resolve inquiries.</p><p> We have found that many of our customers were not aware of the digital support options we provide.

This clearly had nothing to do with improving customer support and was simply about cost. HP so wanted to discourage customers from using phone support to reach a real person for help that they instituted a 15-minute penalty timeout to discourage people from waiting.</p><p> There&#39;s some kind of joke to be made here about this literally inhumane approach to customer support being unveiled in the same week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane">HP announced its acquisition of Humane</a> — the company that turned its $1,000 AI Pins into bricks.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘HP Added a 15-Minute Waiting Time for Telephone Support Calls’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/hp-15-minute-wait">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sigma BF</title><link href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/bf/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41601</id><published> 2025-02-24T17:46:46Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T17:46:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Absolutely beautiful new camera from Sigma. Full-size sensor, interchangeable lens system, but it&#39;s the camera design that jumps out:</p><blockquote><p> The Sigma BF represents a new, more intuitive way to use a camera. It is streamlined to make the act of photography as effortless as possible. We have replaced the shooting mode dial — itself a holdover from the days of film photography — with direct access to the five elements that decide the photograph. Shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode are all immediately available at the touch of a finger. The new Status Monitor displays the currently active setting, so the screen provides an unobstructed view of the subject.</p><p> The BF&#39;s high-resolution screen provides a distraction-free view of all necessary information — and nothing more. With one simple setting, it shows only the live view image, with the five key elements — shutter speed, aperture, ISO, EV compensation and color mode — displayed when you are ready to press the shutter button. All other options and settings are accessed via just three simple menu screens.</p></blockquote><p> This camera immediately struck lust in my heart. So many fewer dials and buttons, it&#39;s striking. They even got rid of storage cards — 230 GB of internal storage instead. $2000 (sans any lenses).</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Sigma BF’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/sigma-bf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Linus Sebastian&#39;s Thoughts After Switching to an iPhone for 30 Days </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41600</id><published> 2025-02-23T23：14：25Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T19:04:13Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I&#39;ve been meaning, since it came out in December, to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">this video from Linus Sebastian</a> of “Linus Tech Tips” fame, and with the iPhone 16e dropping this week, now seems like a good time. It&#39;s a common genre that dates back decades before YouTube was even a thing: longtime user of platform X switches to rival platform Y for a few weeks, and then explains what they liked, what they didn&#39;t, what confused them, etc. This sort of thing always raises hackles because there&#39;s a natural human tendency to get tribal — if not downright religious — about one&#39;s platforms of choice. And Sebastian&#39;s intro — playing to YouTube&#39;s algorithm — frames it in a way that makes it seem like his overall take on iOS is going to be inflammatory. Right in the first 30 seconds of the 20-minute video, he says:</p><blockquote><p> Just a few days into my iOS challenge I started to look a little differently at the Apple users in my life. They describe Apple products with marketing slogans like “it just works” as though they actually believe them, and it made me wonder, does Apple have one version of their products for the True Believers and then a different one for the scrubs like me? Because my time with the iPhone 16 Plus has been absolutely riddled with unintuitive design choices, unnecessarily limited functionality, and some of the weirdest bugs that I have encountered on a supposedly finished product in years.</p></blockquote><p> The first time I watched the video, my finger started hovering to the close-tab button at this point.但是，这个挑衅的开放并不能真正代表塞巴斯蒂安的实际观察和抱怨。 It&#39;s just the YouTube/social-media style.我？ I would start an essay, on, say, the things that bug me the most about Android, in the least inflammatory way possible, to open people&#39;s minds and get as many Android proponents as possible to relax, and listen to my arguments. And then I&#39;d try to make my case, building to a crescendo where I deliver my perhaps inflammatory conclusions only at the very end. YouTube works the reverse way — you start out in provocative fashion to raise hackles, because outrage drives engagement, but then sort of work your way back toward reasonableness.</p><p> Sebastian is a long-time Android user, but he&#39;s not really a phone guy at all. He doesn&#39;t review phones, typically. His own personal Android phone is several years old. His interest and renown is entirely in the field of PCs. So his video isn&#39;t really “ <em>Android power user reviews iOS</em> ”, but more like “ <em>PC power user who is also an Android user tries an iPhone for a month</em> ”.</p><p> I like these sort of videos because I&#39;m all-in on iOS at this point. I&#39;ve kept an Android phone at my desk since the Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One">Nexus One</a> in 2010, but the one still at my desk is a five-year-old Pixel 4. I feel more out of touch with the state-of-the-art on Android than ever. So a video like this, from the perspective of someone who is himself way out of date with the state-of-the-art on the iPhone side of the fence, is really interesting.</p><p> Sebastian winds up making a bunch of astute critiques of iOS and the iPhone experience. None of them were new to me, and none of them really left me with any sense of missing out by not being part of Team Android. But most of his complaints are completely legit — and a lot of them are things Apple should address. He complains repeatedly about iOS&#39;s animated transitions making everything feel slow. That&#39;s 100 percent true. As an everyday iPhone user I&#39;m just completely used to that. But those animations really do make iPhones feel slower than they are. In terms of tech specs iPhones are literally the fastest phones on the planet. Apple&#39;s A-series silicon is, and always has been, years ahead of the best silicon money can buy in an Android handset. But a lot of aspects of iOS <em>feel</em> slower than Android because of animated transitions which iOS (nor iPadOS) offers no option to speed up.它应该。 And the Accessibility setting to completely turn off animations doesn&#39;t solve the problem; what I want, and I think what Sebastian wants, is <em>faster</em> animations. (Sebastian also justifiably complains about the fact that so many useful iOS settings are buried under Accessibility. Many of the settings in Accessibility are related to accessibility, but a lot of them would be better found in an “Advanced” section of Settings that doesn&#39;t exist.)</p><p> Sebastian also correctly skewers iOS for its confusing audio volume settings; Android definitely wins here. Rearranging home screen icons sucks on iOS. CarPlay has annoying bugs. His fresh eyes were annoyed by something mine just accept: that Apple&#39;s first-party apps tend to put their preference settings in the Settings app, but third-party apps tend to keep them in-app. (But now Apple is starting to do that too, with new apps like Sports.)</p><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhew95wMmP8">Give the video a watch</a> . Again, it didn&#39;t leave me with an iota of envy for life on the Android side of the fence, but it reminded me about a bunch of things on iOS that don&#39;t make sense, and seemingly are the way they are only because that&#39;s how they always have been.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Linus Sebastian’s Thoughts After Switching to an iPhone for 30 Days’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/23/linus-sebastian-switch-to-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Going Deep on &#39;Deep&#39; </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/18/deep-peak-deep-deepseek-ai-tech-chatgpt-naming/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/22/going-deep-on-deep" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41599</id><published> 2025-02-22T15:42:55Z</published><updated> 2025-02-26T19:05:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>File this one under “precise words matter”.

<p>Jim Rea:</p><blockquote><p> Forty years ago today the doors opened for the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/Photos-of-the-first-Macworld-in-1985-and-why-15880682.php">very first Macworld Expo</a> in the Brooks Hall basement in San Francisco. For most of you this event probably seems like ancient history, somewhere back in the mists of time. But for me this was a very real and exciting event that I participated in as an exhibitor, the start of my amazing journey with the Mac community, a journey that continues on today.</p><p> As I recall there were two or three dozen software booths that first year. Some of the software on display included <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/multiplan-10">Multiplan</a> (Microsoft), <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/pfsfile-pfsreport">PFS:File</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/thinktank-128">Think Tank</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/filevision">FileVision</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/games/mac-slots">Mac Slots</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/habadex">Habadex</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macdraft-12">Mac Draft</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/maclion">Mac Lion</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/musicworks">Music Works</a> , <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/clickart-publications">Click Art</a> and of course <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/overvue">OverVUE</a> (the direct predecessor to today&#39;s Panorama X). Of course all of these companies have long since disappeared, except for two — Microsoft and ProVUE Development. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty nice club.</p><p> I&#39;m quite proud to have kept ProVUE Development in the Macintosh database business every single day from then to now. The RAM based database concepts I started with in 1984 are still the core of the software today, of course much further developed. In fact, if you look at screen shots of the original OverVUE from 1984, and Panorama X from 2025, the family resemblance is unmistakeable. On the left is 68k assembly code using the original Mac ROMs, on the right is Objective-C using AppKit, but the concepts are the same. There are even databases that have been brought forward from the left all the way to the right — in continuous use over four decades!</p></blockquote><p> There are old-school Mac developers still going strong, and there are <em>old school</em> Mac developers still going strong. I&#39;m not sure about this “Microsoft” company, but ProVUE&#39;s achievement here is quite remarkable. Read through for Rea&#39;s 40% discount code to celebrate this 40-year anniversary.

<p>Apple, in a very precisely worded statement issued to the media (including me) this morning:</p><blockquote><p> Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">As we have said many times before</a> , we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.</p></blockquote><p> The context for this is the news that broke two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM4OTA0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwMjg2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzg5MDQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImRiNmNkODlmLThiZjMtNDkwMy05ZjJlLTFkYmIxOGJmNTViNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDIvMDcvYXBwbGUtZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1iYWNrZG9vci11ay8ifQ.jmi16EkHDs4oV8NT_duwmo2NQd8rxE3enCtbFsh8KNU&amp;itid=gfta">by Joseph Menn in The Washington Post</a> , and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57b391a0-c531-4cde-a5e9-c5d60b21a161">Tim Bradshaw in the Financial Times</a> , that (quoting Menn&#39;s report, emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p> Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. The British government&#39;s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. [...]</p><p> The office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence, the people said. The law, known by critics as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, <em>makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand</em> . An Apple spokesman declined to comment.</p></blockquote><p> By definition, end-to-end encryption can have no secret backdoor, so compliance with this order from the UK would, in broad strokes, require Apple to abandon end-to-end encryption — not just for users in the UK but all users in all countries globally. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-21"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-21">1</a></sup> More insidiously and outrageously, they are apparently forbidden by UK law, under severe penalty (imprisonment), from even informing the public about this demand, or, if they were to comply, from telling the public what they&#39;ve done. The UK expects Apple to give them secret access to all iCloud data without Apple telling anyone — including, I believe, <em>even the US government</em> — that they&#39;ve granted the UK government this breathtaking access.</p><p> Rather than comply, Apple is choosing instead to pull Advanced Data Protection from the UK. For UK users not already using ADP, the ability to enable it was already turned off before Apple&#39;s statement was sent. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">This report from BBC News</a> has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/uk-adp-screenshot.jpeg">a screenshot</a> of what UK users see if they attempt to enable it today.</p><p> Re-read Apple&#39;s statement above, which I&#39;ve quoted in full, including the hyperlink. What stands out is that Apple is offering no explanation, not even a hint, <em>why</em> the company “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature”. On issues pertaining to security and privacy, Apple always explains its policies and features as best it can. The fact that Apple has offered no hint as to why they&#39;re doing this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">canary statement</a> of sorts: they&#39;re making clear as best they can that they&#39;re under a legal gag order that prevents them from even acknowledging that they&#39;re under a legal gag order, by not telling us why they&#39;re no longer able to offer ADP in the UK. This sort of read-between-the-lines implicit confirmation that they&#39;re under a gag order is the only sort of confirmation they can legally offer, at risk of imprisonment.</p><p> Enabling ADP is controlled server-side, so Apple was able to disable the ability for UK users to turn on ADP without requiring a software update to devices. But it&#39;s an open question how this will play out for users in the UK who already have ADP enabled. Apple cannot disable ADP remotely. With a moment&#39;s thought, you can realize why they can&#39;t: it would defeat the entire purpose. In the same way that Apple can&#39;t hold its own key to decrypt a user&#39;s data with ADP, they also can&#39;t hold the ability to disable ADP.</p><p> Enabling ADP is reversible, however. After turning it on, a user can revert to standard protection, turning it off. But they must <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/adp-turn-off-screenshot.png">manually confirm</a> it. I suspect what Apple is going to do for UK users with ADP already enabled is begin issuing warnings, instructing them to disable it manually, before some deadline. Once that deadline passes, I think Apple will have to stop allowing iCloud access to ADP-protected accounts in the UK. That won&#39;t leave the data of those users unprotected — they simply will lose access to sync until they disable ADP and revert to standard protection.</p><p> The bottom line is that the UK government is proceeding like a tyrannical authoritarian state.那不是夸张。 And the breathtaking scope of their order — being able to secretly snoop, without notice that they even have the capability, not only on their own citizens but every Apple user in the entire world — suggests a delusional belief that the British Empire still stands. It&#39;s simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hack-us-telecoms-salt-typhoon-88cabc592dae2fa870772c5ce4ace5ea">recent Salt Typhoon attack</a> China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK&#39;s actual power and standing in the world.</p><p> Apple is, rightly and righteously, telling them to fuck off.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-21"><p> If you use Advanced Data Protection, your iCloud data can only be decrypted (a) by your own devices, (b) using the recovery key that you control from when you enabled ADP, or (c) by any recovery contacts you&#39;ve created in iCloud. Apple insists that you must generate a recovery key or specify at least one recovery contact to enable ADP. Lose your devices, lose your recovery key, and lose your iCloud passphrase, and no one, including Apple, can recover your iCloud data. That level of cryptographically guaranteed security is the benefit of ADP. It&#39;s also the risk of ADP. And there&#39;s a convenience cost. For example, web access to iCloud. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Quoting from Apple&#39;s own ADP documentation</a> :</p><blockquote><p> When a user first turns on Advanced Data Protection, web access to their data at iCloud.com is automatically turned off. This is because iCloud web servers no longer have access to the keys required to decrypt and display the user&#39;s data. The user can choose to turn on web access again, and use the participation of their trusted device to access their encrypted iCloud data on the web.</p><p> After turning on web access, the user must authorize the web sign-in on one of their trusted devices each time they visit iCloud.com. The authorization “arms” the device for web access. For the next hour, this device accepts requests from specific Apple servers to upload individual service keys, but only those corresponding to an allow list of services normally accessible on iCloud.com. In other words, even after the user authorizes a web sign-in, a server request is unable to induce the user&#39;s device to upload service keys for data that isn&#39;t intended to be viewed on iCloud.com, (such as Health data or passwords in iCloud Keychain). Apple servers request only the service keys needed to decrypt the specific data that the user is requesting to access on the web. Every time a service key is uploaded, it is encrypted using an ephemeral key bound to the web session that the user authorized, and a notification is displayed on the user&#39;s device, showing the iCloud service whose data is temporarily being made available to Apple servers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s for reasons like “I lost my only device and forgot my iCloud password”, and to provide easy access to iCloud through the web, that Advanced Data Protection is not the default for all users.</p><p> I think it&#39;s technically possible that Apple could maintain “end-to-end encryption” in a pedantic sense while adding an additional UK-controlled signing key to all encrypted data in iCloud. Let&#39;s say you own two Apple devices, an iPhone and a Mac, and you use Advanced Data Protection. Your data can only be decrypted by those two devices, or by your recovery key, or by a device controlled by one of your recovery contacts. Apple could do something like add the UK government as, effectively, a recovery contact, to each and every user in the world&#39;s encrypted iCloud data. That would still be “end-to-end”, it&#39;s just that the UK government would control one of those end points. But the way iCloud security is designed, something like that cannot be added silently. When a new device is added to your iCloud account, all of your existing devices get a notification that a new device has been added. I personally see these notifications hundreds of times a year, every year, as I add new review unit devices to my account. Like back in September, I got four iPhone 16 review units, two Apple Watch review units, and purchased my own iPhone 16 Pro. And I own several Macs, several Apple Watches, and an iPad. Each one of those devices, when added to my iCloud account, even just temporarily for testing, generated a notification about the new device being added to my iCloud account to each and every one of my other devices, new or old, currently signed into my iCloud account. That&#39;s a minor annoyance for me as a product reviewer, but of course I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Apple&#39;s system is built such that new devices cannot be added to the chain without a notification being generated and sent to every existing device in your account. This notification regarding new devices happens even with standard protection — it&#39;s not exclusive to users who&#39;ve enabled ADP.</p><p> So while in theory some company could (I think?) build a system that is fairly (but deceptively) described as “end-to-end encrypted” where one of the “ends” is secretly and silently controlled by the UK government, Apple&#39;s iCloud is not such a system. Apple is prevented by UK law from explaining this, unfortunately, but I think it&#39;s true that as iCloud currently stands, Apple cannot comply with the UK&#39;s demands for ADP-protected accounts, because they can&#39;t add a UK-controlled decryption key to existing iCloud accounts without notifying every device signed into every account. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★苹果从英国撤离英国对全球后门的需求，从英国撤出高级数据保护</title></entry><entry><title>Yankees Loosen The Boss&#39;s Facial Hair Policy </title><link href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/yankees-change-facial-hair-policy" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/yankees-facial-hair" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41595</id><published> 2025-02-21T16:10:45Z</published><updated> 2025-02-21T16:17:43Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner:</p><blockquote><p> “In recent weeks I have spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees — spanning several eras — to elicit their perspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy, and I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback.

It&#39;s the most Yankees story possible that this policy change is much bigger news than the fact that the team today also signed manager Aaron Boone to a two-year extension through the 2027 season. MLB reporter Bryan Hoch:</p><blockquote><p> The grooming policy dates to George M. Steinbrenner&#39;s purchase of the team. As the legend goes, its roots grew in 1973, when Steinbrenner observed his team on the first-base line for Opening Day against the Cleveland Indians.</p><p> Steinbrenner was not yet “The Boss,” so new in the role that he could not identify the players by their faces. Instead, he focused upon their hair — unkempt mustaches, mutton chops and shaggy locks. He scowled, scribbling uniform numbers on a scrap of paper urgently dispatched to manager Ralph Houk. Tell these men to get a haircut, Steinbrenner commanded.</p></blockquote><p> My favorite Yankee, Don Mattingly, not only ran into grief over this policy with George Steinbrenner, but <a href="https://youtu.be/BMzeznCyX8w">again with the next team he played for</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Yankees Loosen The Boss’s Facial Hair Policy’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/yankees-facial-hair">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Barbara Broccoli on Amazon, in Private: &#39;These People Are Fucking Idiots&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db?st=P86jBM&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/broccoli-amazon-idiots" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41594</id><published> 2025-02-20T19:42:32Z</published><updated> 2025-02-20T19:42:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Erich Schwartzel and Jessica Toonkel, reporting for The Wall Street Journal back on December 19, under the headline “Where Is James Bond? Trapped in an Ugly Stalemate With Amazon” ( <a href="https://apple.news/A4AvCvPCIScSH_SJzKGD7gQ">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Nearly three years after Amazon acquired the right to release Bond movies through its $6.5 billion purchase of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio, the relationship between the family that oversees the franchise and the e-commerce giant has all but collapsed. The decaying partnership has scuttled any near-term hope of a new Bond film — a black eye for Amazon&#39;s ambitions in Hollywood, since at the time of the MGM sale, the Bond franchise represented a significant share of the $6.5 billion the company paid for the studio.</p><p> When it comes to Bond&#39;s future, the power lies in the hands of Barbara Broccoli, who inherited the control from her father, Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, and who for 30 years has decided when a new Bond movie can go into production. She has told friends she doesn&#39;t trust algorithm-centric Amazon with a character she helped to mythologize through big-screen storytelling and gut instinct. This fall, she characterized the status of a new movie in dire terms — no script, no story and no new Bond.</p><p> To friends, Broccoli has characterized her thoughts on Amazon this way: “These people are fucking idiots.”</p></blockquote><p> One way out of a stalemate, apparently, is to sell. Here&#39;s Broccoli&#39;s public statement today, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/global/james-bond-amazon-mgm-gain-creative-control-1236313930/">accompanying the news</a> that Eon Productions has reached a deal <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">that shifts creative control over the franchise to Amazon</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of &#39;No Time to Die&#39; and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”</p></blockquote><p> Broccoli&#39;s brother Michael Wilson was ever so slightly more magnanimous in his statement, saying “Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future,” but it&#39;s rather striking that Broccoli said not a word about Amazon in her statement, and Wilson&#39;s praise only went so far as the lone adjective <em>trusted</em> . But the lie to Wilson&#39;s attempt at even slight magnanimity is that Eon Productions and Amazon were <em>never</em> partners. It was the old MGM Studios, before Amazon&#39;s acquisition, that was Eon&#39;s partner from the very beginning ( <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/646-dr-no">1963&#39;s <em>Dr. No</em></a> ).</p><p> I meant to post a link to this WSJ story when it broke, and mistakenly thought I had, but it slipped through the cracks around the holidays. But I&#39;ve had a bad feeling about the franchise&#39;s future ever since.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Barbara Broccoli on Amazon, in Private: ‘These People Are Fucking Idiots’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/broccoli-amazon-idiots">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Leaked Image of the First Post-Humane-Acquisition Product From HP&#39;s Printer Division </title><link href="https://x.com/VCBrags/status/1892332805570314491" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/hp-humane" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41593</id><published> 2025-02-20T16:57:38Z</published><updated> 2025-02-21T14:50:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Alex Ritman, with blockbuster news at Variety:</p><blockquote><p> Amazon MGM Studios is set to take creative control of the James Bond franchise. The shock announcement — which is sure to shake and, indeed, stir the industry — was made Thursday, alongside the news that long-time producers and custodians of 007, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, would be stepping back.</p><p> As per details of the historic agreement, Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli have formed a new joint venture to house the James Bond intellectual property rights. The three parties will remain co-owners of the iconic franchise but Amazon MGM will have creative control.</p></blockquote><p> The villains in Bond stories are often bald billionaire industrialists who either build rockets or own media companies, with lasciviously-dressed women on their arms. It&#39;s hard to imagine how we could come closer to a real-life Bond villain taking control of the franchise. (At least it wasn&#39;t Musk.)</p><p> “Nepo babies” is a term that tends only to be used pejoratively, but family ownership is a proven model to nurture and maintain — to protect — exceptional companies with exceptional cultures. Berkshire Hathaway owns several where their agreements not only allowed, but encouraged, the families to maintain control post-acquisition. <a href="https://www.sees.com/about-us/sees-family">See&#39;s Candies</a> comes to mind.<a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/SpecialLetters/WEB%20past%20present%20future%202014.pdf">This letter from Warren Buffet</a> describes their strategy. But Berkshire is itself an exceptional company. Most corporate conglomerate acquisitions of creator/family-run endeavors wreak devastation upon everything that made those smaller operations unique and special. Look at what&#39;s happened to The Washington Post now that Bezos owns it. There&#39;s much to complain about The New York Times in general, and current publisher AG Sulzberger in particular (sixth generation of family control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company">since Adolph Ochs bought the paper in 1896</a> ), but The Times is still The Times.</p><p> Heretofore, Barbara Broccoli did that with the 007 franchise. The output was uneven under her and Wilson&#39;s producing stewardship, but the Daniel Craig era was a splendid return to form. There&#39;s no other movie franchise like it. The closest is <em>Mission Impossible</em> but that franchise is a distant second place, in my mind. It lacks a certain magic, a timeless but yet somehow always modern <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of the 007 franchise. Always the same, but somehow always fresh.</p><p> I expect Amazon to bleed it dry, alas. Spinoffs and “universe” expansion galore, of generally low quality in all regards: writing, casting, production values. But most of all I expect they&#39;ll make the same fundamental mistake Disney has made with <em>Star Wars</em> — instead of leaving us craving more, they&#39;ll produce as much dreck as they can and leave us saying “ <em>enough, stop</em> ”, with the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/330459-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story">occasional</a> <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83867-star-wars-andor">gems</a> fighting for attention in a <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/page-b4e74f38-aa35-4b12-965c-93f4a931f78a">river</a> of <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled/">downright embarrassing unwatchable crap</a> .

<p>Last week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">Tim Cook teased</a> a “newest member of the family” product announcement coming today; turns out it was <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/">the iPhone 16e</a> , a device whose name briefly paralyzed me with indecision regarding how to capitalize it, <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-19">1</a></sup> which replaces the three-year-old iPhone SE (3rd generation) in the lineup.</p><h2> The Announcement</h2><p> Apple made the announcement in a 13-minute video that is currently atop their home page, but seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">only perma-linkable at YouTube</a> . (Maybe <a href="https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-16e/2025/d9015f23-5cc1-45b4-b25a-2b1caee9d7ac/films/announcement/iphone-16e-announcement-tpl-us-2025_16x9.m3u8">this</a> ?) It was also, of course, announced in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a press release on Apple Newsroom</a> . The first three minutes of the video feature Tim Cook (talking about how great iPhones are, the iPhones 16 in particular, and Apple Intelligence). Cook hands things off to iPhone product marketing VP Kaiann Drance for the next five minutes; Drance mostly recaps iOS 18&#39;s tentpole features, especially, of course, Apple Intelligence. Drance hands off to keynote first-timer (I think) Lucy Browning, a director of iPhone product design, who talks up the 16e specifics. The most unusual thing about the video is its setting: not Apple Park, not the Steve Jobs Theater, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I&amp;t=2727s">the infinite white void</a> , where, in a bygone era, Apple TV commercials like the famed Hodgman/Long “I&#39;m a Mac / I&#39;m a PC” series were set. (The new infinite void is arguably light gray, not white.)</p><h2>名字</h2><p>First, the name. It&#39;s not the fourth-generation iPhone SE, and instead sports an altogether new “e” suffix. Apple has used an “S” suffix with the iPhones 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS; “C” with the iPhone 5C, and “R” with the XR. We shall see if this “e” is a one-off. In an online press briefing today, when asked whether the “e” stands for anything, an Apple rep said no, it does not stand for anything, but that it&#39;s built for everyone. I don&#39;t think she meant to imply that the “e” secretly stands for <em>everyone</em> , if only because I&#39;m pretty sure Apple doesn&#39;t want everyone buying the lowest-price iPhone model. Apple never had an explanation for the “SE” name either, although in my head I&#39;ve already read that as maybe sorta kinda standing for <em>special edition</em> ? Way back in the day, I think Phil Schiller once said the “S” in “iPhone 3GS” stood for <em>speed</em> , because the 3GS was in fact strikingly faster than the prior year&#39;s 3G, and the “C” in “iPhone 5C” definitely, if unofficially, stood for <em>color</em> . But it&#39;s best not to waste too much time trying to find any logic to this other than that Apple thinks “iPhone 16e” looks and sounds cool. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not the “iPhone 16 AI”.</p><p> Using the “16” generation as part of the name is more interesting than the new “e” suffix. It perhaps suggests that e-edition phones might become annual. I wouldn&#39;t bet on that. But the SE models came out in March 2016, April 2020, and March 2022, so the gaps have been irregular. At the very least though, the 16e name will help make it clear, in years to come, what the basic specs of this iPhone were and when, roughly, it debuted. Every time I&#39;ve referenced the third-gen SE in the last year or two, I&#39;ve had to look up exactly when it debuted and which A-series chip it sported (A15, same as the iPhone 13).</p><h2>定价</h2><p>As expected, the existing third-gen iPhone SE is now out of the lineup. The third-gen SE debuted in March 2022 with a starting price of $430 (for a paltry 64 GB) with 128 and 256 GB configurations for, respectively, $480 and $580. The new iPhone 16e starts at $600, which, depending on how you look at it, is either a $170 increase (in the price of the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells) or a $120 increase (in the price of the cheapest 128 GB iPhone Apple sells). I&#39;ve already seen gobs of people arguing that the iPhone 16e “should” start at just $500, but if you look at Apple&#39;s pricing for the entire iPhone 16 lineup, there are $200 gaps, for the same storage tiers, between the 16e and regular 16, and between the regular 16 and 16 Pro. So I&#39;d argue that $600 is the “right” price. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39;s inflation calculator</a> , $500 in January 2022 is about $565 in January 2025 dollars.</p><p> Here&#39;s a table with the lineup of new iPhones Apple currently sells. I&#39;m including the now-discontinued iPhone SE for reference. Also note that while these are the only models Apple itself sells to consumers, other old models are still sold by various carriers and retail partners around the world, including the iPhone SE for now. </p><table class="table-5EE26071-E20E-463E-860C-F4FEB8AD1841" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The 16e does support inductive Qi charging, but only at a pokey 7.5-watt rate. The regular 16 and 16 Pro models support MagSafe charging at up to 25 watts, and the iPhone 15 at 15 watts. You can charge an iPhone 16e using a MagSafe charging puck, but only at 7.5 watts, and it won&#39;t magnetically snap into place. It&#39;ll just function as a non-magnetic pad. I don&#39;t know if this decision was about component pricing (the $200 difference has to come from somewhere, and it&#39;s not going to be Apple&#39;s margins), the internal space that MagSafe components occupy in the device (see next section), or marketing differentiation. Probably some combination of all three. The old SE only supported 7.5-watt no-MagSafe Qi charging as well.</p><h2>电池</h2><p>Battery life is better than the regular iPhone 16. This is equally surprising to me. From Apple&#39;s own Comparison page:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png" class="noborder"><img
    src   = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Apple's comparison of battery life specs between the iPhone 16 Pro, 16, and 16e."
    width = 525
  /></a></p><p> How exactly is the 16e achieving battery life that surpasses the more expensive iPhone 16, and is effectively on par with the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro? I suspect it&#39;s a combination of a larger battery and a more efficient cellular modem. As rumored, the 16e is Apple&#39;s first iPhone with an in-house–designed modem, which, in the video, Kaiann Drance introduces thus (emphasis added): “And with iPhone 16e, we&#39;re expanding the benefits of Apple silicon with C1, the first Apple-designed cellular modem. It provides fast and reliable 5G connectivity, and <em>it&#39;s the most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone</em> .” Just as with CPUs and GPUs, Apple&#39;s interest in custom silicon isn&#39;t only about price and performance — it&#39;s about efficiency too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=199">Drance then continues</a> (speaking over a cool breakaway animation of the 16e&#39;s internal components), “We combined the incredible power efficiency of Apple silicon with an all-new internal design for iPhone 16e that has been optimized for a larger battery. Together, it paves the way for an unprecedented level of battery life in a 6.1-inch iPhone.” There might be other changes that allow the 16e to accommodate a larger battery than the regular 16, but from the spec sheet, the obvious one is the omission of MagSafe.</p><h2> Apple&#39;s C1 Chip</h2><p> The power efficiency sounds great, and of course the modem supports “5G”, but it doesn&#39;t support mmWave / ultra wideband, the crazy super-fast variant of 5G with Wi-Fi-like speed <em>and</em> Wi-Fi-like short range from carrier antennas that serve it. Block-by-block here at home in Philadelphia, I see ultra wideband from Verizon on some blocks of the city ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118203">denoted by the “5G UW” icon in the status bar</a> ), but not most. But do I really care? I honestly don&#39;t know why I&#39;m supposed to care about 5G at all compared to LTE. Using LTE instead of 5G (let alone 5G ultra wideband) makes no practical difference for anything I do over cellular on my phone. Obviously Apple wants to support ultra wideband in its own modems eventually, but their renewed deal with Qualcomm — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">announced and crowed-about only by Qualcomm</a> , because Apple despises them and deeply resents its own dependence upon them — covers “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026”. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a C-series chip in this September&#39;s expected iPhone 17 or 17 Pro — but perhaps we&#39;ll see one in the rumored iPhone 17 “Air”.</p><p> Remember too that when last I saw it tested — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">by Nicole Nguyen in 2022</a> — disabling 5G and exclusively using LTE extended the battery life of an iPhone 13 Pro from 13 to 15.5 hours in her video-streaming test. Ultra wideband 5G <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">is indeed insanely fast</a> , and regular 5G is generally faster than LTE, but for most people in most places not in ways that practically matter, especially considering the effects on battery life. “Plenty fast enough, with longer battery life” is a better trade-off than “way faster than you&#39;ll notice, with somewhat shorter battery life”.</p><p> Speaking of wireless, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the C1 chip, but the iPhone 16e supports only Wi-Fi 6, not 7, and doesn&#39;t support Thread networking.</p><h2> Just One Camera on the Back, but It&#39;s “2-in-1”</h2><p> No surprise here — cameras are expensive, and only offering one makes for very obvious differentiation. Apple&#39;s calling this lone camera “2-in-1” because, like the main camera on other recent iPhone models, it offers both 1× and 2× <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6110937480">optical fields of view</a> (1× uses the entire 48MP sensor, producing a 12MP image by treating the sensor pixel array as “quad pixels; 2× produces 12MP images by cropping the center 12MP of the sensor). The lack of a second ultra-wide camera means not just no 0.5× lens, but also no macro photography, and no spatial photos or video. The 16e also offers only “Photographic Styles”, not the “latest-generation Photographic Styles” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16#photography">offered by the 16 and 16 Pro</a> .</p><p> If you really care about your <em>camera</em> , the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t the iPhone for you. As mentioned above, it has fewer lenses and the imaging pipeline doesn&#39;t support the next-generation Photographic Styles (which, five months in, I continue to really enjoy in my own photography). But that doesn&#39;t mean the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t a valid choice for people who care about their photos. Some people really do care about their photography, but also really just point and shoot using their main 1× camera, no matter which iPhone model they own. Not worrying about camera hardware and only concerning yourself with lighting and framing is a philosophy shared by many seriously talented photographers.</p><h2> No Camera Control Button</h2><p> The other camera-hardware-related ding against the 16e is that it doesn&#39;t have the new Camera Control button/slider on the side. I know several iPhone 16 owners who claim they never use it or even flat out dislike it, because they find themselves invoking it only by accident. I really like it, and use it as my primary way to launch the Camera app and to capture images. But, you know, we all captured images and videos just fine for 17 iPhone generations without that hardware button. No matter how much you like it, you certainly don&#39;t need it.</p><p> But, up until now, you <em>did</em> need the Camera Control button to invoke <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-visual-intelligence-with-camera-control-iph12eb1545e/ios">the visual intelligence feature of Apple Intelligence</a> . A press-and-release of Camera Control launches your favorite camera app; a long-press invokes visual intelligence. Apple&#39;s solution to enable visual intelligence on the iPhone 16e, despite it lacking the Camera Control button, is two-fold. First, visual intelligence is now available in Control Center. Second, as demonstrated by Apple in the announcement video, you can assign the Action Button to visual intelligence. (By default, just as with other iPhones equipped with the Action Button, it defaults to toggling silent mode, like the dedicated ringer switch of yore — where by “yore” I mean still on the iPhone 15.)</p><p> Apple representatives also told me today that owners of the iPhone 15 Pro will soon be able to bind their Action Button to visual intelligence, “in a future software update”. I suspect that future software update is iOS 18.4, which should be launching in beta any day now, but Apple wouldn&#39;t comment, on or off the record, when exactly this feature will come to the iPhone 15 Pro. They also confirmed that the Control Center button to launch visual intelligence is also coming to iPhone 15 Pro (and presumably iPhone 16 models, too). The iPhone 15 Pro, despite qualifying for Apple Intelligence, has heretofore lacked the visual intelligence feature, because the visual intelligence feature has only been trigger-able via the Camera Control button. It&#39;s a little odd, frankly, that Apple didn&#39;t enable this feature via the Action Button and Control Center for 15 Pro users months ago — perhaps they really wanted to wait for the 16e announcement?</p><h2>展示</h2><p>The 16e display specs seem pretty good, but the front sensor array is behind a notch, not a dynamic island. That&#39;s a reasonable design trade-off for the lowest-price model. The 16 and 16 Pro displays offer maximum brightness specs of 1,000 nits (typical), 1,600 nits (HDR), and 2,000 nits (outdoor). The 16e display offers 800 nits (typical), 1,200 (HDR), and doesn&#39;t go higher than that. The 16 and 16 Pro dislays also go down to just 1 nit minimum brightness; Apple doesn&#39;t list a minimum brightness for the 16e display.</p><h2>硅</h2><p>The A18 chip in the iPhone 16e seems (on the specs page) nearly identical to that of the iPhone 16, except for the number of GPU cores: the 16e has only 4 GPU cores, but the regular iPhone 16 has 5. (The A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max has 6 GPU cores.) No big whoop.</p><p> What&#39;s more interesting than comparing to the iPhone 16 is comparing to the iPhone 15, which costs $100 more than the 16e. Because the only A17-generation chip was the A17 Pro that went into the iPhone 15 Pro models, the regular iPhone 15 has the same A16 chip from the iPhone 14 model year. Aside from all the general performance improvements in the A18 compared to the two-year-old A16, the big functional difference is that the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 15 does not. As covered extensively when Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC last June, that&#39;s mainly a function of RAM, but whatever the reasons, the less expensive iPhone 16e has Apple Intelligence, and the iPhone 15 does not. Maybe that&#39;s not a <em>big</em> whoop, but it&#39;s definitely a whoop of some sort.</p><p> Perhaps, like the three generations of SE models, the iPhone 16e is designed to stay around for several years at this price point. If it does, the fact that it costs $100 less than the “year-old regular iPhone” will make more sense come September, when that $700 year-old model is the iPhone 16. But until September, the iPhone 16e looks like a better phone in several ways than the iPhone 15. It has a faster chip that supports Apple Intelligence and significantly longer battery life. The iPhone 15 does have a 0.5× ultra-wide camera, and it has a slightly better display (that includes the nicer dynamic island instead of a notch). And of course the iPhone 15 comes in colors like pink, yellow, green, and blue. But if you keep your phone in a case all the time, like most people do, you probably don&#39;t care about the color of your phone much. The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less.</p><h2>颜色</h2><p>You can get any color 16e that you want, so long as it&#39;s black or white. The third-gen iPhone SE came in midnight, starlight, and Product Red. (Is Apple done partnering with Product Red now? I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-marks-world-aids-day-with-red/">Apple Watch Series 9 was the last device offered with Product Red</a> .)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-19"><p> For a while with the iPhone 4S, there was some ambiguity whether Apple intended the “S” to be upper- or lowercase, because their marketing materials used a small-cap “S”, and a small-cap “S” looks almost exactly like a lowercase “s”. They settled on uppercase for the 4S. But when the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, Apple not only styled both of those suffixes lowercase, they retroactively re-styled the &#39;S&#39; in the &#39;4S&#39; as lowercase. I wrote about this at length <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">in this footnote in my iPhone 5S and 5C review in 2013</a> , in which I explained my decision to uppercase them. But I sort of like the way “16e” looks. It&#39;s ... friendly? And the lowercase “e” carries the correct implication that this is a lesser sibling to the regular iPhone 16, not an upgrade or superior of some sort. So for now, I&#39;m going with the flow and keeping the “e” lowercase. One friend, to whom I vented my consternation regarding how to handle this, unhelpfully suggested I go with <em>iPhone 16ᵉ</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Thoughts and Observations on Today&#39;s iPhone 16e Announcement</title></entry><entry><title> &#39;Oh, the Humane-ity&#39; </title><link href="https://spyglass.org/humane-ai-pin-strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/oh-the-humane-ity" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41590</id><published> 2025-02-19T16:48:23Z</published><updated> 2025-02-19T16:48:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>From Humane&#39;s “AI Pin Consumers FAQ”, which <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers">they link to</a> with one of the best euphemisms of the year thus far — “We understand this transition may be difficult, and you may have questions”:</p><blockquote><p> Key Dates to Remember:</p><ul><li> <em>Effective immediately</em> : Ai Pin is no longer available for new purchases.</li><li> <em>February 28, 2025 at 12pm PST</em> : Ai Pin devices will no longer connect to Humane&#39;s servers, and .Center access will be fully retired.</li><li> <em>February 28, 2025 at 12pm PST</em> : All customer data, including personal identifiable information (PII), will be permanently deleted from Humane&#39;s servers.</li></ul></blockquote><p> This was a $700 purchase (for the matte black base model — polished metal ones were $800) with a mandatory $24/month service charge (which included cellular networking) and extra battery “boosters” were $70. Customers who bought when it launched last April have spent at least $1,000, but probably more, all told. Humane gave them 10 days notice before the thing turns into a brick.</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will I receive a refund for my Ai Pin?</em></p><p> Refunds are only available for customers who are still within the 90-day return window from their original shipment date. You are eligible to receive a refund if your product shipped on or after November 15th, 2024. All device shipments prior to November 15th, 2024 are not eligible for refunds. All refunds must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.</p></blockquote><p> Translation: tough shit.</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will my Ai Pin work with another cellular provider after the shutdown?</em></p><p> No. Once the service is discontinued, your Ai Pin will no longer function as a cellular device or connect to Humane&#39;s servers. This means no calls, texts, or data usage will be possible. [...]</p><p> <em>Can I still use my Ai Pin for offline features?</em></p><p>是的。 After February 28, 2025, Ai Pin will still allow for offline features like battery level, etc., but will not include any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access.</p></blockquote><p> You can check the battery of a device that no longer offers any useful functionality. I get it, companies go bust, and when they go bust, their services go bust with them. But this is exactly the sort of outcome that made Humane&#39;s AI Pin seem more like a scam than a product all along.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘When ‘FAQ’ Stands for ‘Fucking Angry Questions’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/19/humane-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> We Found the Sucker Willing to Buy Humane, and as Promised, I&#39;m Going to Be Insufferable, Because of Course It Was HP </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/hp-116-million-deal-for-humane-includes-ip-but-no-ai-pin-device" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w38" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41588</id><published> 2025-02-18T22:42:14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-18T22:49:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Brody Ford, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> HP Inc. will acquire assets from Humane Inc., the maker of a wearable Ai Pin introduced in late 2023, for $116 million.</p><p> The deal will include the majority of Humane&#39;s employees in addition to its software platform and intellectual property, the company said Tuesday. It will not include Humane&#39;s Ai pin device business, which will be wound down, an HP spokesperson said.</p><p> Humane&#39;s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate artificial intelligence into the company&#39;s personal computers, printers and connected conference rooms, said Tuan Tran, who leads HP&#39;s AI initiatives. Chaudhri and Bongiorno were design and software engineers at Apple Inc. before founding the startup.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale">Yours truly, last May</a> , when news broke that Humane was looking for a buyer, “seeking a price of between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale”:</p><blockquote><p> I suspect they&#39;ll sell for a pittance — way less than the $230 million they&#39;ve raised. I just don&#39;t see what they have to offer. Humane doesn&#39;t own the AI that powers the AI Pin — that comes from OpenAI, which seemingly not only doesn&#39;t want to buy Humane, but is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23893939/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence-device">supposedly in exploratory talks</a> with Jony Ive&#39;s LoveFrom to design and build their own AI devices. The laser projector idea seems to be a bust, and the hardware&#39;s battery life is measured in hours between battery pack swaps.</p><p> Off the top of my head, the only company that could afford a $1 billion-ish price for Humane <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/304397/the-hp-autonomy-lawsuit-timeline-of-an-ma-disaster.html">is dumb enough</a> to do it is HP.</p></blockquote><p> Well, at least we can say HP was smart enough not to spend $1 billion on this. But they were dumb enough to bring into their company Chaudhri, who was described to me, by someone who worked with him at Apple (and a person whom I&#39;ve never heard badmouth a single other former colleague), as “an utter fraud”. But a fraud whose <a href="http://www.imranchaudhri.com/">personal website</a> is an inadvertent testimony to the lunacy of the US patent system — that it serves ego inflation, not innovation.</p><p> But who knows? Maybe I&#39;m all wet and Humane will prove to HP what NeXT proved to Apple, and we&#39;ll all be hanging on every thread of Imran Chaudhri keynotes in a few years and he&#39;ll lead HP back to greatness.

<p>You saw the news last week, I&#39;m sure, that both of the major mapping-app providers, Google and Apple, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">have updated their maps to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”</a> . Microsoft&#39;s Bing Maps, which I would describe as a minor provider, has made the change too. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-17">1</a></sup> It&#39;s all actually quite a bit more complicated than “they renamed the Gulf of Mexico”, but bear with me for now.</p><p> You&#39;ve also seen, I&#39;m equally sure, a lot of people angry at Google and Apple for going along with this. That anger is — to some degree — misplaced. I get where the anger comes from, but it&#39;s still misplaced. My initial take, right in the midst of Trump&#39;s inauguration speech on January 20, was that if he went through with it, Apple and Google and everyone else who publishes maps should just ignore it. Trump, obviously, did go through with it: the United States Geological Survey, an agency within the Department of the Interior, which is within the executive branch and thus under the president&#39;s purview, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/gulf-america">officially made the change on February 7</a> . Now that it&#39;s official US government policy, “just ignore it” really isn&#39;t feasible. If that&#39;s still your stance, I implore you to consider at least a bit more nuance.</p><p> But let&#39;s first stipulate up front that there are multiple far more important and urgent issues facing the United States and the world, just four short weeks into the Trump 2.0 administration. Off the top of my head: Ukraine, Gaza, tariffs, DOGE, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/nyregion/scotten-letter.html?unlocked_article_code=1.w04.Lkj2.Tu4sBTtDGwqQ&amp;smid=url-share">the rule of law</a> . Whether you approve or disapprove of Trump&#39;s actions on any or all of those issues, there should be no question that all of them are important and consequential. The name we see on maps for a body of water, not as much. But it&#39;s the smallness, the relative unimportance, the spiteful pettiness of the renaming in the first place — down to the fact that until Trump&#39;s executive action, there was no controversy, <em>zero</em> , <em>none</em> , <em>nada</em> , anywhere in the world, amongst any group of people, regarding the name of the Gulf of Mexico — that makes it interesting to examine in detail how Google and Apple have chosen to deal with it. It&#39;s only because this particular issue is so spectacularly piddling that we can consider it in full.</p><p> The motivation behind the name change is simple as well. Trump didn&#39;t change the US&#39;s officially recognized name of, say, the Atlantic Ocean or the continent of Africa. He just as easily could, but he won&#39;t. And it&#39;s not like “Gulf of Mexico” was on a list of “debatable or controversial names” until he created this controversy out of thin air. It&#39;s just the one name on the globe that a president of the United States can change to stick it to Mexico, a country Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/judge-curiel-trump-border-wall/index.html">has objectively racist feelings toward</a> . Trump never campaigned on building a wall at our <em>northern</em> border with Canada, nor has he (yet?) attempted to rename Lake Ontario. It&#39;s about Mexico, and asserting power by fiat. Trump has a lifelong history of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trump-in-name-only-how-investors-lost-millions-buying-into-t">putting his name on buildings he doesn&#39;t own</a> . He&#39;d rather have his name emblazoned on a building he doesn&#39;t own than own a building that doesn&#39;t bear his name. To Trump, the name on the sign is more important than the deed. So too, now, with the name on a map. The Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water that belongs to no nation, but declaring this new name implies that it heretofore belonged to Mexico, and now belongs to us, which is to say belongs to him, our unquestioned dear leader. That Trump took it from Mexico, without firing a shot — when in fact all he did was order a string to be changed in a government database. Shakespeare would have us believe that a sea by any other name would taste as salty. Trump doesn&#39;t read Shakespeare.</p><h2> How Google and Apple Are Labelling the Gulf, Globally</h2><p> The first important thing to know is that Google Maps and Apple Maps are not singular global atlases. They both show different names (and in rare cases, different geographies) in different regions around the world. They each are more like a collection of regional atlases. In constrast, there&#39;s only one <a href="https://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a> . If the OED changes a word&#39;s definition, or adds a new word, those changes appear to everyone in the world. My OED is your OED, no matter where you and I live or currently find ourselves on the globe. Google and Apple Maps aren&#39;t like that. It&#39;s better to think of them as services that provide region-by-region maps.</p><p> Google, to their credit, has a blog post <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">describing and illustrating exactly what users around the world now see in Google Maps</a> :</p><blockquote><p> In the US, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) has officially <a href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730">updated</a> “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” As we <a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951">announced</a> two weeks ago and consistent with our longstanding practices, we&#39;ve begun rolling out changes to reflect this update. People using Maps in the US will see “Gulf of America,” and people in Mexico will see “Gulf of Mexico.” Everyone else will see both names.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/google-maps-gulf.png">As their illustration shows</a> , “both names” means putting “Gulf of America” in parentheses for users who are anywhere else in the world other than the US or Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</p><p> Apple&#39;s approach has been more Apple-like, which is to say without comment. They made no public comment before changing the name in Apple Maps, and they have made no public comment since. (I&#39;ve asked Apple PR for comment, but gotten none.) I&#39;d appreciate a statement, like Google&#39;s, stating what users around the world should expect to see. But I also understand their desire to say as little as possible. In a sense, the labels on Apple Maps speak for themselves, and are the only thing that actually matters. I also appreciate, that by never declaring a policy on the matter, Apple can change its map labels without rescinding or amending a policy.</p><p> So without a statement from Apple describing how the Gulf is labelled around the world, I did what I could: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114003192100392251">I asked my followers on Mastodon who are outside the US what they saw as the Gulf&#39;s name</a> , and to include screenshots if possible. That was on Friday, 14 February, after Apple Maps began showing “Gulf of America” in place of “Gulf of Mexico” to users here in the US. The response was overwhelming, with replies from people in over two dozen countries from around the world. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-17">2</a></sup> And at the time, their replies suggested that Apple was taking a subtly but intriguingly different approach from Google. To wit, while everyone in the US saw “Gulf of America” (with no mention of the established name), everyone everywhere else in the world still saw “Gulf of Mexico” (or their language&#39;s translation of that name), with no mention, in parentheses or otherwise, of the new name now recognized by the United States.</p><p> I hoped that that was Apple&#39;s plan, which would have been quietly subversive in isolating the United States as the only country in the world to even see the name “Gulf of America”. But I feared that Apple was simply slower than Google, that changes had been applied for users in the US first, but changes for the rest of the world simply hadn&#39;t propagated. My fears were warranted.</p><p> Late in the evening (US Eastern Time) on Saturday, 15 February, new responses to my entreaty on Mastodon began showing labels in Apple Maps that matched Google&#39;s:</p><ul><li> In the US: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> In Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> I believe that the determining factor for what label you see, at least for Apple Maps, is unrelated to your physical location as determined by GPS or your IP address, but simply the region setting of your OS. On both MacOS and iOS, that&#39;s in Settings → General → Language &amp; Region → Region. This makes sense — you can use Apple Maps (and Google Maps) with Location Services turned off. You can play with this setting on your device to see what users around the world see in Maps without leaving your home, and without changing your device&#39;s language. Thus, if you&#39;re an American with your device set to the “United States” region, if you travel outside the US without changing your device settings, you&#39;ll still see the US-specific new name for the gulf: “Gulf of America”, with its historic and world-recognized name — dare I say, its unambiguously <em>correct</em> name — not even referenced in parentheses.</p><h2> The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment</h2><p> This whole thing, needless to say, sucks. It&#39;s profoundly stupid, and the aspects that aren&#39;t stupid are jingoistic. But the notion that Google or Apple might reasonably just ignore this and tell Trump (and the entire Republican Party, and their supporters) to go pound sand is facile. I&#39;m not saying they <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do it. Of course they <em>could</em> . That&#39;s like saying Trump <em>can&#39;t</em> just declare a new name for an international body of water with a heretofore uncontroversial 400-year-old name.</p><p> But it wouldn&#39;t be reasonable. It is reasonable for Google and Apple Maps to defer to, or at least acknowledge, the officially recognized names for each region in which they&#39;re available. It&#39;s not Google&#39;s or Apple&#39;s place to determine and adjudicate the official names on a map; their job is to recognize and display those names. In theory Google and/or Apple <em>could</em> position themselves as a global authoritative reference for geographic names. To be to maps something akin to the OED or Merriam-Webster to the English language. But if they were to pursue that route they&#39;d put themselves in the position of adjudicating any and all controversies and disputes over names and borders. Civic government is where we should <em>want</em> such disputes arbitrated, if not resolved. Not by private companies. If Apple Maps is to be available in China, Apple Maps needs to present names and borders ( <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">and even the size of land masses</a> — more on this below) that are amenable to the Chinese government. China sticks out because their demands are in stark contrast to the names and borders recognized by the rest of the world. Chinese maps are governed by CCP-mandated dogma. Most maps are governed by geographic and geopolitical reality. Taiwan, for example, is in fact an independent nation. Chinese maps (including those served by Apple to mainland Chinese users) label Taiwan as a province of China.</p><p> Now the United States is governed by another such dogma-driven regime.</p><p> In theory, maps ought not be political. In practice, they are and always have been. In theory, reasonable decisions and objectively correct decisions are one and the same when it comes to cartography. In practice, politics intercedes and they conflict. You can argue (and many people are) that Google and Apple should stick with the 400-year-old, recognized-the-world-over, and heretofore uncontroversial name “Gulf of Mexico”, and apply it globally. To simply ignore the new officially-recognized name of the gulf by the United States government. They <em>could</em> do that. No one would go to prison if they did. There would be no fines. But there would be a price to pay. Ignoring the new “Gulf of America” name recognized by the US government would, without question, court controversy. Republicans started to complain <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dan-crenshaw-complains-to-tim-cook-that-apple-maps-hasn-t-changed-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america/ar-AA1xIK2t">that Apple Maps hadn&#39;t adopted the new name</a> three weeks ago, before the change was even made official in the government&#39;s GNIS reference database.</p><p> To ignore political reality is to court political controversy. It is not in the interests of large multinational corporations to court controversy. But it&#39;s not possible to <em>avoid</em> controversy. What is reasonable is to minimize controversy. There&#39;s a famous quote from Michael Jordan, when he declined to publicly endorse the Democratic challenger to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2001/08/29/jesse-helms-white-racist/42090cb6-2e9b-4b13-a820-2a9b74c88fbe/">unabashedly racist</a> Republican Jesse Helms in the 1990 North Carolina Senate race: “ <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29130478/michael-jordan-stands-firm-republicans-buy-sneakers-too-quote-says-was-made-jest">Republicans buy sneakers, too.</a>透明</p><p>Some might say “That&#39;s the problem with capitalism.” I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s one of the <em>benefits</em> of capitalism. Unless you think extreme polarization is in the service of society, you want to see major institutions that are apolitical. For-profit corporations naturally serve that role. Yes, there&#39;s a profit motive. Republicans don&#39;t just buy sneakers, they buy phones and conduct web searches too. But who wants to see a world where everything is polarized politically, where every retailer, every device maker, every online service provider, every restaurant, every single thing you do, buy, or visit, is viewed through a polarized political prism?这样就在疯狂。</p><p> Most Americans, and most people in the western world, are beyond exhausted by our current levels of societal polarization. Escalating tensions further is not just contrary to the bottom-line interests of Apple and Google, it&#39;s in none of our interests. People just want good accurate maps. They don&#39;t want to choose — or worse, to be forced to choose — between right-leaning maps and left-leaning maps.</p><p> So if your argument is that neither Apple nor Google should be showing the name “Gulf of America” to anyone, anywhere, I&#39;m with you that that&#39;s the correct cartographical stance. But it would constitute political malpractice. Maps are important services to both companies, but the editorial integrity of their maps isn&#39;t close to their primary business or purpose. Maps aren&#39;t to Google or Apple what the English language is to the OED or Merriam-Webster. (Or what the news is to, say, the Associated Press. Hold that thought.)</p><p> So whether Google and Apple should show the new name at all shouldn&#39;t be the question we&#39;re asking. The right question is necessarily more nuanced: Who should see which names, where? And Google and Apple&#39;s answers to <em>that</em> question are, alas, disappointing and worrisome. I&#39;ll repeat the seemingly identical policy both companies are <em>actually</em> presenting today, by region:</p><ul><li> United States: “Gulf of America”.</li><li> Mexico: “Gulf of Mexico”.</li><li> Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)”.</li></ul><p> The best politically realistic option they could have chosen would be (I&#39;ll use italics to emphasize that these are my own suggestions):</p><ul><li> <em>United States: “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”</em> .</li><li> <em>Everywhere else in the world: “Gulf of Mexico”</em> .</li></ul><p> There&#39;s no good reason to even show “Gulf of America” in parentheses outside the US. We&#39;re the ones with the stupid name change on the books, so we&#39;re the ones who should get stuck seeing the stupid name. No one else should suffer the consequences of our political idiocy. But it <em>is</em> correct to show us, in America, the new dumb “Gulf of America” name. Again, if it were up to me, American users would see “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)”, and everyone else would just see “Gulf of Mexico”. But that&#39;s surely the best we in the reality-based community could hope for.</p><p> It&#39;s absurd that users here in the US no longer see “Gulf of Mexico” at all. You can search for that term, and the “Gulf of America” will be the first result, but the 400-year-old name “Gulf of Mexico” no longer appears as a label on maps to US-region users for either Google Maps or Apple Maps. In any even vaguely reasonable political climate, even those in favor of the name change would endorse, perhaps even insist upon, a transitional period where the previous, familiar name appears in parentheses. Insisting that the name be changed in a snap, with no parenthetical reference to the previous name (a name that, again, has been recognized globally for over 400 years, and remains on every single printed map in existence, and every single work of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-old-man-and-the-sea-the-hemingway-library-edition-ernest-hemingway/15532053?ean=9781476787848&amp;next=t&amp;next=t">literature</a> and history referencing the Gulf) has some truly Orwellian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a> vibes. We&#39;ve always been at war with Eastasia. It&#39;s always been the Gulf of America.</p><p> The US political right often makes use of the term “ <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/snowflake/">snowflake</a> ” to suggest that those on the left are delicate and fragile. But it sure seems snowflaky to object to “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” as a map label. Sticks and stones may break their bones but a historically accurate parenthetical map label will hurt them? Food for thought as you enjoy your <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/congress-french-freedom-fries-iraq/">freedom fries</a> .</p><p> Consider the simple premise that a map ought to make sense to someone who doesn&#39;t follow current events. That ought to be uncontroversial. But to someone who has tuned out of the news for the last two months this change must seem downright baffling. Even worse, it&#39;s misleading. There&#39;s no reason for most people even to suspect, let alone know, that both Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and labels. Americans, in general, tend to be parochial. Showing Americans the name “Gulf of America”, without “(Gulf of Mexico)” strongly implies that this is now the new world-recognized name, when in the fact the truth is quite the opposite: it&#39;s a name recognized by one and only one country. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-17">3</a></sup></p><p> Not showing the new name, at all, to Americans would be unreasonably provocative to the Trump administration and its supporters. But showing the new name to every region in the world but Mexico itself is needlessly obsequious to Trump and his supporters. And making Mexico an exception to global naming policy isn&#39;t an honor or a favor to them — it&#39;s an implied insult. It insinuates that there&#39;s something wrong with them, too, legitimizing the notion that outside the US Trumpist right, there&#39;s a legitimate debate about the Gulf&#39;s name. The implied message is “ <em>Here you go, you delicate idiots, we&#39;ll make you the second of only two nations in the world regarding the displayed name of this body of water — you, and the United States.</em> ” Mexico neither asked for nor provoked any of this. (Mexico only achieved independence from Spain in 1821; the “Gulf of Mexico” name is twice as old as Mexico as a nation, and at least 150 years older than the United States.)</p><p> There are numerous countries where Google Maps and Apple Maps show region-specific names and differing disputed borders ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/9wq9vf/why_is_there_no_border_on_google_maps_between/">or lack thereof</a> ). From <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/">a 2020 report in The Washington Post</a> :</p><blockquote><p> And the line in Western Sahara marking the northern border with Morocco disappears for Moroccans seeking it out on the Web — along with the region&#39;s name altogether. The sparsely populated northwest Africa region is disputed between Morocco, which seized it in 1975, and the indigenous Sahrawi.</p><p> Sometimes that flies in the face of international consensus. Google Maps users inside Turkey can find the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or TRNC, represented in the northern third of the Mediterranean island nation. The territory is not recognized by the United Nations, nor Google&#39;s mapping competitors.</p></blockquote><p> There are other places around the world where Apple and Google show downright crazy or incorrect things on maps. The latter have one thing in common: they are to comply with the demands of countries governed by thin-skinned autocratic men who surround themselves with sycophants. As mentioned above, in China, Taiwan <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/fact-check-apple-maps-taiwan-03072024174451.html">is falsely labelled as a province of China in Apple Maps</a> . <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-17">4</a></sup> (Google Maps, like Google services generally, aren&#39;t available in China.) In 2021, in a report for The Information headlined “ <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them?rc=jfy0lk">Inside Tim Cook&#39;s Secret $275 Billion Deal with Chinese Authorities</a> ”, Wayne Ma reported:</p><blockquote><p> Sometime in 2014 or early 2015, China&#39;s State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping told members of the Apple Maps team to make the Diaoyu Islands, the objects of a long-running territorial dispute between China and Japan, appear large even when users zoomed out from them. Chinese regulators also threatened to withhold approval of the first Apple Watch, scheduled for release in 2015, if Apple didn&#39;t comply with the unusual request, according to internal documents.</p><p> Some members of the team back at Apple&#39;s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., initially balked at the demand. But the Maps app had become a priority for Apple, so eventually the company complied. The Diaoyu Islands, when viewed in Apple Maps in mainland China, continue to appear on a larger scale than surrounding territories.</p></blockquote><p> You&#39;ll stand on firm ground criticizing Apple for capitulating to China&#39;s demands on that. But the root problem clearly isn&#39;t Apple. It&#39;s that China is governed by communist authoritarians, and authoritarianism warps minds — including those of the authoritarian leaders themselves. You know what no one says? “ <em>The leadership of China is completely sane and sensible, and their edicts are based on reality, not dogma.</em>透明</p><p>If you don&#39;t see that Trump&#39;s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is on the same spectrum of nuttiness, then your mind, at least on this matter, has been warped. We can argue how far along that spectrum this “Gulf of America” thing is, but the only reasonable debate is of matters of degree. Apple and Google&#39;s decision to show this made-up name in parentheses to everyone around the world is akin to showing China&#39;s fictionally inflated size of the Diaoyu Islands to everyone in the world, as, say, a dotted outline surrounding the geographically accurate representations of the actual islands&#39; sizes. There&#39;s a word for this stuff, and that word is <em>propaganda</em> .</p><p> Imagine if the government of France decreed that the English Channel was now the “French Channel”. Now imagine that Google and Apple Maps complied, even just to the degree of changing the label, <em>outside</em> France (which, per their company policies, should see “French Channel”) and the United Kingdom (which would still see only “English Channel”) to show the rest of the world, including us in the United States, “English Channel (French Channel)”. It would rightfully be considered insulting nonsense.</p><p> The only difference from my hypothetical and our reality with the Gulf of Mexico is that France, in addition to not having a narcissistic would-be autocrat as its president ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-gets-new-government-after-weeks-uncertainty-2024-09-21/">yet</a> ?), is not the world&#39;s lone remaining superpower. That&#39;s what makes Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s acquiescence worrisome, not merely irritating. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamellebouie.net/post/3lia22gxsgk24">pithily observed over the weekend</a> , on Bluesky, “My take is that your willingness to accept this Gulf of America nonsense is an indicator of your willingness to accept much worse things coming from this administration.”</p><p> The calculus Google and Apple should naturally be striving to achieve is finding the correct balance between two axes. One axis is integrity: both the cartographic integrity of the labels on the companies&#39; maps, and the institutional integrity — <em>dignity</em> even — of the companies themselves. Billions of people around the world trust Google and Apple. Their decisions on this mapping matter — no matter how trivial in the grand scheme of things — should strengthen, not erode, that trust.</p><p> The other axis is the minimization of controversy.</p><p> Simply maximizing integrity — by ignoring the “Gulf of America” name completely — would incur volcanic controversy within the United States. This calculated balance is behind my suggestion of showing “Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico)” within the United States, and showing just “Gulf of Mexico” everywhere else. Perhaps the inclusion of the longstanding name within parentheses is too much for freedom-fry-eating Republicans. But showing the new “Gulf of America” name in parentheses to everyone around the world is itself incurring controversy, and, more tellingly, is a strike against the integrity of both the companies and their maps.</p><p> Obsequiousness is inherently undignified. Google and Apple are proud companies. But both have chosen a gratuitously undignified presentation of this new American-dictated name to the entire world. Their mutual decision here ultimately seems driven not by integrity (to be sure), nor the minimization of controversy, but instead by a third, unnatural factor: fear.</p><p> Neither company will comment on it but surely this issue — inconsequential in the grand scheme of things though it may be — rose to the highest ranks of leadership. I&#39;ll eat my hat if Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook didn&#39;t both sign off on, if not actively participate in the decision-making process, how to represent the Gulf of Mexico&#39;s name. Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. But so eager are Pichai and Cook to avoid the wrath and vindictiveness of Trump that they&#39;re willing to peddle his foolish “Gulf of America” name to everyone in the world who doesn&#39;t live in Mexico. Wrapping it in parentheses is like wrapping a dead fish in newspaper — it doesn&#39;t contain the stench.</p><p> Of course “The Gulf of America” name is stupid. Trump is stupid. Not stupid meaning dim or dull — would that he were, but he remains sharp, cunning, and highly agitated — but stupid because he&#39;s nuts, warped by a narcissistic disorder of Napoleonic dimensions. The new name is as stupid as his MAGA hats are ugly. He might as well have sold<a href="https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/david-foster-wallace/index.php?title=Subsidized_Time">the naming rights</a> to Musk and Tesla. There is something really wrong with him, and this “Gulf of America” name change exemplifies at least one aspect of his narcissistic insanity.每个人都知道。 Even his supporters know it. They just tell themselves it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s how tribalism morphs into cultism.</p><p> The false note in Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s parable “The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes” is that once the emperor is called out, for in fact strutting around stark naked while ostensibly wearing a suit of clothes so fine that they&#39;ve visible only to the eyes of smart and discerning people, is that <em>all</em> the townsfolk laugh at him. That wouldn&#39;t happen. Many would laugh. Most, one hopes. But the emperor&#39;s die-hard supporters would react with anger at the outburst of mockery, not join in the laughter. He looks great, they&#39;d insist, not like the jackass their own lying eyes tell them he is.</p><p> There is something wrong with Trump — and there is something lesser, but worrisomely wrong with those defending him.</p><p> Apple Maps and Google Maps do not consider themselves cartographic editorial authorities. They choose not to show one universal set of mapping (and naming) data to the world.他们可以。但是他们没有。 Actual editorial authorities, on the other hand, are under no obligation to follow the US GNIS&#39;s official decisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Wikipedia correctly still calls it The Gulf of Mexico</a> . The Associated Press, whose stylebook is followed by many publications, small and large, <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/">issued the following guidance after Trump&#39;s executive order last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The body of water has shared borders between the US and Mexico. Trump&#39;s order only carries authority within the United States. Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.</p></blockquote><p> The Trump administration — petty, stupid, vindictive, and most of all, <em>insecure</em> fools that they are — has lashed out, and is now in the midst of a weeklong standoff <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/white-house-continues-its-absurd-ban-against-the-associated-press/">during which they&#39;ve prevented AP journalists from attending official events</a> , entirely and solely because of the AP&#39;s perfectly reasonable style guidance on the Gulf&#39;s name. If Trump and his 2.0 administration had any modicum of confidence that this name change is correct and justified, they&#39;d roll their eyes, not lash out, at the Associated Press for continuing to stipulate otherwise. What kind of government does stuff like that? Everyone knows the answer: tin-pot dictator autocracies. (And <em>would-be</em> autocracies, we can hope.) <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-17">5</a></sup> This whole “Gulf of America” thing is, if you take a step back, objectively hilarious. Like Pinocchio turning into a real boy, Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico is like a late night comedy joke turned real. It&#39;s beyond parody. If this had been on SNL during the 2024 campaign, you&#39;d have laughed. And you should laugh now. Mockery is a powerfully subversive weapon against authority — even more effective, I&#39;d argue, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists">than a guitar</a> .</p><p> But it&#39;s worth directing our laughter at Google and Apple as well. They&#39;re squandering their own hard-earned reputations for integrity to suggest there&#39;s even a parenthetical alternative-name level of international legitimacy — not merely one man&#39;s vanity — behind this.没有。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-17"><p> <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> , god bless them, are still labelling it “Gulf of Mexico”.

<p>A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_bug">scorebug</a></em> is industry jargon for the sub-genre of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chyron">chyron</a> (itself jargon) that shows ever-present information about a televised sporting event while you&#39;re watching. These graphics display the teams, the score, the time remaining, and other metadata pertaining to the current situation. The current ball/strike count in baseball. The down and yards-to-go in football. The shot clock in basketball.那种事情。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-10">1</a></sup></p><p> Fox was the broadcast network for Super Bowl 59 yesterday, in which the Philadelphia Eagles utterly embarrassed the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 (but which felt like a score of 114-0). The NFL rotates the Super Bowl annually between the networks that broadcast games. Fox has a tradition of unveiling updated on-screen graphics packages when it has the Super Bowl. This year, they didn&#39;t just tweak the design, they completely re-thought it and redesigned it.</p><p> First, here&#39;s Fox&#39;s familiar old scorebug, as captured from their broadcast of Super Bowl 57, a game that <em>also</em> pitted the Eagles against the Chiefs two years ago. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-10">2</a></sup></p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/fox-nfl-scorebug-old-2160.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

If everything looks the same as usual, everything is probably as safe as usual. If something looks jarringly different, it might be a sign that you&#39;re about to be killed.

I quickly not only warmed up to the new scorebug, I decided I <em>really</em> like it. It&#39;s better than Fox&#39;s old one, and better than every other network&#39;s (which all largely look the same), in almost every single regard.</p><p> I like the new scorebug so much I (cross-)posted about it to social media during the game. My posts, in order of engagement: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">Threads</a> (~6,600 likes, ~700 replies and reposts), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">Bluesky</a> (~3,900 likes, ~600 replies and reposts), and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">Mastodon</a> (179 likes, 53 replies and reposts).</p><p> No change an app developer can make will generate more commentary and emotional feedback from users than changing the app&#39;s icon. Everyone sees an app&#39;s icon, and has an opinion about them. That opinion, after a change, is usually “ <em>I like the old icon and hate the new one.</em> ” Likewise with a game broadcast&#39;s scorebug — everyone sees them, and everyone has an opinion when they change. Most reactions to Fox&#39;s new scorebug were negative, and many of those were <em>really</em> negative. Yahoo Sports ran a story under the headline “ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">Super Bowl: Fox Sports Debuts New Scorebug, to Universally Negative Reaction</a> ”. The sports media-focused site Awful Announcing ran a take by Drew Lerner under the headline “ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">Please Stop Debuting New Scorebugs During the Super Bowl</a> ” (subhead: “Can&#39;t I just watch one Super Bowl without having to learn a new graphic?”). I have not even come close to reading all the replies to my social media take (well, except on Mastodon — it was quick to catch up there), but if you peruse them, you&#39;ll be quick to see that most replies are from people who despise the change. A representative tasting:</p><p> “ <em>It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn&#39;t bother having someone check it first.可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “<em>哈哈。 Muted for being a dumbass.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>It&#39;s hideous, and its overbearing size distracts from the actual content of the game.</em>透明</p><p>“ <em>The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don&#39;t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.</em>透明</p><p>“Looks like something out of Fortnite” isn&#39;t the dis the last commenter thinks it is. A lot of people play and love Fortnite.</p><p> Here&#39;s an expanded (from what I posted to social media) version of why I like, perhaps even love, the new scorebug. First, the primary items: who&#39;s playing and what&#39;s the score:</p><ul><li> <em>Team initialisms</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Team logos</em> : None. Colors say enough.</li><li> <em>Score</em> : Huge.</li><li> <em>Game clock</em> : Big enough and centered.</li><li> <em>Needless chrome</em> : None.</li></ul><p> Every team in the league is known by fans by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation of its home location, sort of like airport codes or stock tickers. They&#39;re all obvious ( <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">unlike many</a> airport codes). The Dallas Cowboys are DAL. The New England Patriots are NE. For the two cities which have two teams, New York and Los Angeles, the cities conveniently abbreviate to two letters and a third letter is drawn from the team nicknames: the Giants and Jets are NYG and NYJ; the Rams and Chargers are LAR and LAC.</p><p> Team logos are not as instantly identifiable, especially at small sizes. A bunch of teams have angry bird mascots: Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Cardinals. Do you remember the Tennessee Titans&#39; logo? Or the Houston Texans&#39;? The Cleveland Browns don&#39;t even have a logo to speak of. (And they&#39;re also not brown.) But I guarantee you know which teams are TEN, HOU, and CLE. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p> And, importantly, these team initialisms are not represented by typography alone: they are in a box with the team&#39;s primary color. That use of color does all the branding work necessary, and does it more effectively, at small sizes or viewed from far distances, than the team logos. (One small niggle I have is that the team initialisms are big white letters but are outlined by the team&#39;s secondary color. If you look closely at my screen capture from yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl above, you&#39;ll see that “KC” is outlined in yellow and “PHI” in silver. This has the effect, at a normal viewing distance, of making the initialisms look a little fuzzy. The secondary color outlines are too subtle to have their intended effect of further branding the teams, and instead have the unintended effect of making the text look poorly rendered on screen. I bet Fox tweaks this by next year.)</p><p> The elimination of all needless chrome is arguably the most striking change of all, because Fox&#39;s old scorebug had the most chrome with the most superfluous “3D” styling and textures. This isn&#39;t minimalism, per se, but it&#39;s a strike against needless decoration — reminiscent to my mind of Jony Ive&#39;s radical redesign of iOS 7 a decade ago. Elements that can be conveyed by type and color alone <em>are</em> expressed by type and color alone.</p><p> Other noteworthy features:</p><ul><li><p> <em>Timeouts remaining</em> : Prominent but not distracting. Seeing how many timeouts a team has remaining was a huge problem with Fox&#39;s old scorebug, and with most other networks&#39; current scorebugs. (Remaining timeouts are very important in close football games.)</p></li><li><p> <em>Current down and yards to go indicator (eg “1st &amp; 10”)</em> : Placement atop the team initialism conveys which team has the ball. Fox&#39;s old scorebug did have a “possession” indicator, but scroll back up to look at it, and see how long it takes you to figure out what it is. I&#39;ll put the answer in a footnote. <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p> <em>Typography</em> : Classic, legible, bold, timeless. It is also very “Fox” — the C in “KC” looks like the O in the classic “FOX” wordmark, and the zero (a digit Chiefs fans became very familiar with until the final seconds of the third quarter, because that&#39;s how many points they&#39;d scored until then — the Eagles cycled through a bunch of different digits en route to taking a 34-0 lead) looks pretty much exactly like the uppercase o in “FOX”.</p></li></ul><p> Bigger and bolder typography adds clarity. But removing the background chrome lets viewers “see through” to any game action that happens at the bottom of the screen. To me, after just one game, the old Fox scorebug looks hopelessly dated; old-fashioned without any nostalgic charm. If anything, the new typography-first design is the one that looks timeless, evocative of the graphics from classic NFL Films productions.</p><hr /><p>这是什么。 NFL broadcasts didn&#39;t always have scorebugs. I don&#39;t mean that they had smaller score indicators on screen. I mean they had none at all. This was true for all major sports on TV, not just football (eg the premise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">this gag from <em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a> ). Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials. But while the game played, there was no score on screen. Part of that is technology: game telecasts were low-fidelity over-the-air transmissions to relatively small TV screens that were viewed from across the room. Go back far enough and there wasn&#39;t even color. But a bigger aspect is inertia. Not showing the score at all times was the way games were always broadcast, so it was the way they were still broadcast.</p><p> Then came Fox.</p><p> For decades, there were three major TV networks in the US: ABC, NBC, and CBS. CBS had the Sunday game rights to the superior National Football Conference. “Superior” for the related reasons of team popularity <em>and</em> <a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">team market size</a> , which matters for ratings. Chicago, Philly, Washington, Dallas, Frisco. NBC had the Sunday game rights for the American Football Conference with teams from generally smaller cities. Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Miami. Good teams, but smaller cities. (In 1993, though, NFC teams had won 9 consecutive Super Bowls.)</p><p> Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox network was an attempt — soon enough proven successful — to establish a fourth US network. At the time of their debut in 1987, Fox only had prime time programming on one night a week (Sundays, conveniently). In 1993 Murdoch and Fox upended the world of sports broadcasting by outbidding (stupid, tightfisted, hubristic) CBS for the rights to broadcast the NFC games on Sundays.</p><p> In 2018, Bryan Curtis published at The Ringer a comprehensive oral history of the deal and its consequences: “ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever</a> ”. If this sort of thing interests you at all, read that. It&#39;s a great story, well told.</p><p> But so in 1994 Fox took over the NFC broadcasts. They poached from CBS all the announcers, cameramen, directors, and producers. (CBS didn&#39;t need them anymore, because they had no football games to broadcast.) But while the voices announcing the game were familiar (including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">the best duo ever to do it</a> : John Madden and Pat Summerall), the look and feel of the broadcasts was intentionally new and fresh and, well, because it was Fox, brash. This included an innovation they called the “Fox Box”. Quoting from Curtis&#39;s oral history at The Ringer:</p><blockquote><p> <em>David Hill&#39;s most controversial idea about the NFL was his simplest: He thought the score and clock should have a permanent home on the screen — a feature that became known as the “Fox Box.” A noisy group of critics and rival executives thought the Fox Box was a terrible idea. It would clutter the screen and drive people away from blowouts. But Hill was convinced, because he&#39;d created a proto–Fox Box after a frustrating afternoon watching soccer in the UK</em></p><p> <strong>Hill:</strong> We&#39;d been out walking our dogs. We&#39;d come in, got a cup of tea, and switched the BBC on. I watched the game for a good 15 minutes. I don&#39;t know what the score is. I&#39;m thinking to myself, “Shit, I&#39;d really like to know what the score is.” So I thought, “That&#39;s easy. On a chyron, I&#39;ll just put it up in the corner.” So I did it.</p><p> <strong>Madden:</strong> Instead of saying, “No, that&#39;s a stupid idea, we got other things we have to do,” he said, “If the score and the time is the most important thing, why don&#39;t we just put it up and leave it there?” That&#39;s where the Fox Box came from. That was David Hill.</p><p> <strong>Dolgin:</strong> All the networks told us, “You&#39;re screwing this up. You&#39;re idiots to do this.”</p><p> <strong>Albert:</strong> The thought was, some networks won&#39;t leave the time and score up because it&#39;s a blowout and they didn&#39;t want you to <em>know</em> it&#39;s a blowout.</p></blockquote><p> The “Fox Box” idea wasn&#39;t just controversial, it was widely panned as stupid. The networks literally thought it would be better if many viewers didn&#39;t know the score. And when the Fox Box appeared, many critics agreed. Here&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">Dan Cox&#39;s review of Fox&#39;s opening week broadcast for Variety</a> , in September 1994:</p><blockquote><p> The network also still insists on that annoying see-through clock and score graphic in the upper-left corner of the screen throughout nearly the entire game. Fox Sports prexy David Hill has said it&#39;s important to know the score and how much time is left when you sit down and the game is already on.</p><p>好吧，是的。 But how about those who actually watched the beginning of the game and would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p></blockquote><p> Who seems stupid now? Imagine the outcry if Fox had broadcast yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl without any scorebug at all — you know, for those who would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business. Smokers want to smoke and would stay home if they couldn&#39;t, the argument went. Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better. But better necessarily implies different.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-10"><p> You know how when you&#39;re watching most TV channels — not just sports, but any sort of show at all — they keep a logo for the channel in one of the corners of the screen? Those omnipresent logos are called <em>bugs</em> (perhaps because everyone knows they&#39;re slightly annoying?). Hence: scorebug for an always-present score indicator. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-10"><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text">DF Style Guide</a> has no entry for “Roman numerals” because no obscenities or expletives are strong enough to convey the policy. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-10"><p> The one matchup this design might not work great for would be a Rams-Chargers game, because in addition to sharing a city (and stadium), they even share the same team colors: blue and yellow.

It&#39;s solvable — <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrbiggs.bsky.social/post/3lhvsptivlk2z">here are some examples with different color treatments</a> from a similar scorebug for the English Premier League.
