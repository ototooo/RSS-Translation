<p>布莱恩·艾拉斯（Bryan Irace）：</p><blockquote><p>除非采取急剧的纠正，否则苹果看起来越来越有可能错过一代开发人员，该一代开发人员首先可以触及<a href="https://cursor.com/">光标</a>， <a href="https://replit.com/">RepliT</a>或<a href="https://v0.dev/">V0</a>等工具，尤其是因为苹果自己的AI工具<a href="https://dimillian.medium.com/where-is-swift-assist-6ea348767cf3">仍然存在明显的缺乏</a>。这远远超出了使新进入者进入“ <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">Vibe Code</a> ”的范围 - 经验丰富的移动开发人员，尽管有Xcode的历史和构建本地应用程序的偏爱，但仍在毫不掩饰地交换了他们的工具，以确认无法履行的生产力优势。 [...]</p><p>长期以来，应用程序评论一直是开发人员挫败感的主要来源。除了专制但不一致的政策执法外，即使将软件分配<em>给您自己的苹果设备也</em>很难，更不用说别人的设备了。无论如何，这并不是什么新鲜事物，但是随着构建应用程序从几周/几个月/几个小时/天缩小的时间，它比以往任何时候都更加令人震惊，因此更像是一种责任。</p></blockquote><p>这是一个周到且令人发人深省的作品。我觉得irace在这里我以前从未见过他们的手指。</p><p>当App Store首次亮相时，开发人员非常高兴。 UIKIT框架（又称CocoAtouch），Objective-C和Xcode是为移动设备创建应用程序的更好方法。对于分发，经过Apple和App Store的运行要容易得多，民主更加民主，而70/30比世界各地的各种电话运营商对开发人员来说要慷慨大方。您很幸运能与运营商分配30/70，他们只能与大型公司开发人员打交道。在应用商店之前，没有独立或业余爱好移动应用程序开发人员。</p><p>不过，17年是很长的时间。很久以前，开发人员不再将App Store视为使他们感到高兴的事情，或者<em>减少了</em>他们生活中的摩擦和麻烦。相反，他们将其视为摩擦和麻烦的主要来源。苹果本来应该专注于使应用商店成为使开发人员（主要是）快乐的事情，而不是（如今的事情）大多是痛苦的。</p><p>基本上，App Store构成的对Apple的威胁<em>不是</em>监管机构。那是一个分心。正如我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">长期以来试图争论的</a>那样，这种威胁可能会失败，是市场力量最终将与之抗衡。开发人员长期以来一直对通过App Store出版的技术和官僚主义的麻烦感到不满，而Apple苹果公司的购买佣金的规模则不断增加。苹果的佣金百分比并没有随着时间的推移而增长，但是今天的70/30甚至<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">85/15分开了</a>这一比例，如今似乎非常慷慨，似乎是一个从事高利贷和虐待租金的平台。</p><p>人工智能可能是带来“最终”的中断，因为现在它也用于开发人员工具体验。如果苹果公司的本地编程框架和开发人员工具不是创建出色应用程序的最佳，最令人满意，最有生产力的方法，那么剩下的使开发人员乐于为iOS平台创建的是什么？</p><p>苹果应该移动山脉，以重新集中精力，使其成为世界上最好的（包括分销和货币化）的苹果平台开发的体验。取而代之的是，他们似乎是基于这样的假设，即这是一种特权，对所有人不言而喻，只是为了为苹果平台开发。</p><div> <a  title="与“蒂姆，不要杀死我的氛围”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/irace-vibe-killing">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://lex.games/df" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7e" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/lexgames_free_daily_word_games" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/feeds/sponsors//11.41738</id><author><name>大胆的火球商务部</name></author><published>2025-03-24T22：14：49Z</published><updated> 2025-03-24T22：14：50z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>选举后，我读了蒂莫西·斯奈德（Timothy Snyder）的<em>暴政</em>。收集了20篇论文 - 每篇相对简短，有些简短 - 它比书籍更重要，可以在下午或几个晚上轻松地消费。我以一种不安的感觉完成了它。上周我再次阅读了它，现在我的感觉更加不安，更坚决。</p><p>斯奈德（Snyder）是耶鲁大学（Yale）普通的历史教授，有一个核心信息，自从特朗普连任<em>之前</em>，<a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/obeying-in-advance">他就一直在锤击</a>：<em>不要事先服从。抵抗。</em>在这二读中，以下段落使我更加艰难，比十一月的特朗普2.0读了两个月。从第19章：“成为爱国者”：</p><blockquote><p>钦佩外国独裁者不是爱国的。与金正恩建立关系不是爱国的。或者说巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar al-Assad）和弗拉基米尔·普京（Vladimir Putin）是优越的领导者。呼吁外国领导人干预美国总统选举并非爱国。在集会上引用俄罗斯的宣传不是爱国。与俄罗斯寡头分享顾问不是爱国的。在俄罗斯公司任命具有财务利益的顾问不是爱国主义的。任命一个喜欢被称为“米莎将军”的国家安全顾问，也不是爱国，也不是爱国主义的。当赦免官方呼吁戒严时，这不是爱国。将美国士兵称为“失败者”和“吸盘”不是爱国主义的。从家庭那里获得医疗保健，也不是在全国流行病中高尔夫球的人，这并不是爱国的。试图破坏美国大选，也不是在失败后赢得胜利并不是爱国。试图结束民主不是爱国的。</p><p>民族主义者可能会做所有这些事情，但民族主义者不是爱国者。民族主义者鼓励我们成为我们最糟糕的情况，然后告诉我们我们是最好的。奥威尔写道：“虽然无休止地忍受着权力，胜利，失败，报仇”，但往往“对现实世界中发生的事情不感兴趣”。民族主义是相对主义者，因为唯一的事实是我们在思考他人时感到的怨恨。正如小说家达尼洛·基什（DaniloKiš）所说，民族主义“没有普遍的价值观，美学或道德。”</p><p>相比之下，爱国者希望国家能够实现其理想，这意味着要我们成为我们最好的自我。爱国者必须关注现实世界，这是唯一可以被爱和维持他的国家的地方。爱国者具有普遍的价值观，他判断自己的国家，始终希望这一价值观，并希望它能做得更好。</p><p>民主在1920年代，30年代和40年代在欧洲失败了，不仅在欧洲，而且在当今世界许多地区都失败了。正是这种历史和经验向我们揭示了我们可能未来的黑暗范围。民族主义者会说“它不能在这里发生”，这是迈向灾难的第一步。一个爱国者说，这可能在这里发生，但我们会阻止它。</p></blockquote><p>我强烈推荐这本书。在<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119?tag=df-amzn-20">Amazon</a> ， <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/2186/9780804190114?prhc=PRHE159AAB82E">BookShop.org</a>或<a href="https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780804190121?at=11l3IH&amp;ct=PRHE159AAB82E--9780804190121">Apple Books</a>获取它。</p><div> <a  title="与蒂莫西·斯奈德（Timothy Snyder）的“暴政”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>特朗普政府意外地包括大西洋编辑杰弗里·戈德堡（Jeffrey Goldberg </title><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/trump-admin-included-goldberg-in-yemen-war-plan-signal-group" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41734</id><published> 2025-03-24T18：14：50Z</published><updated> 2025-03-24T21：01：52Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>成为Mac Power用户的第一笔提示是进入<a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">键盘大师</a>。使用键盘大师感觉就像是获得超级大国。我一直想写更多有关键盘大师的信息，因此，我将开始记录我找到的所有小用例。这是今天的一个。</p><p>我使用<a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">Marsedit</a>在此网站上至少发布99％的帖子。 （另外1％是我在手机上创建的帖子，使用Web界面用于可移动类型。）我<em>经常</em>使用Marsedit。当我认为剪贴板上有文字时，大约每周左右一次，我不小心尝试在Marsedit粘贴文字，但实际上是一张图像。当您将图像粘贴在Marsedit中时，它并不像粘贴到邮件或笔记或文本上，图像只是在文本中。因此，Marsedit试图有所帮助，可以打开其<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/marsedit-upload-utility.png">上传实用程序窗口</a>- 如果我使用WordPress或其他CMS，可能会让我可以将图像上传到我的服务器中，以从博客文章的HTML引用。这不是我的系统的工作方式，而不是我希望它能工作的方式，因此每次发生这种情况时，我都必须关闭上传实用程序窗口。每次，我都会尝试通过键入键盘上的ESC键来做到这一点。但是，上传实用程序窗口不是一个对话框，该对话框带有一个取消按钮，该按钮将由ESC触发。这是一个常规窗口。因此，在击中ESC键（在这种情况下什么都不做的ESC键之后，我再次记得我需要击中⌘W。 （我认为我自然不会想到⌘W，因为我的直觉告诉我⌘W会尝试关闭我正在写的博客窗口。）</p><p>今天它又发生了，最后，我想到我可以用键盘大师解决此问题。我的第一个想法是，我可以创建一个宏，它<em>可以</em>关闭Marsedit的最前窗，并且只有在最前面的窗口被命名为“上传实用程序”时。一秒钟后，我想到的是，我可能会做得更好，如果我尝试在Marsedit粘贴图像，请阻止上传实用程序窗口打开。</p><p>我是对的。这不仅是在键盘大师中创建的超级容易，而且非常快。在这里，我花了10倍的时间来写这个宏，而不是创建它。我认为这就是为什么我很少在键盘大师中写下我的小骇客的原因 - 它们不仅节省了我的时间并消除了烦恼，而且他们很容易创建它们，以至于我只能回到制作新的烦恼之后。</p><p>首先，我在键盘大师中有一个组（思考：文件夹），用于我创建的应用程序特定宏的每个应用程序。您只需创建一个新组，然后将其设置为仅当一个（或更多）特定应用程序处于活动状态时才能可用。在Marsedit的小组内，我创建了一个名为“不粘贴图像”的新宏。</p><p>它是由热键序列⌘V触发的。这意味着每次我粘贴在Marsedit时，这个宏都会运行。键盘大师太快了，我永远不会注意到。 （键盘Maestro Macros执行得如此之快，以至于在某些情况下，您必须添加步骤以暂停0.2秒，以防止宏观上的用户界面进行操纵。）</p><p>宏通过以下伪代码逻辑执行一个简单的<a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/If_Then_Else">IF-then-Else操作</a>：</p><pre> <code>if the System Clipboard has an image play a sound else simulate the keystroke ⌘V</code></pre><p>这就是整个事情。我第一次尝试它时效果很好。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/km-dont-paste-images-marsedit.png">这是我宏观的屏幕截图</a>。</p><p>因此，如果<em>我</em>在Marsedit中键入⌘V，并且剪贴板包含一个图像，我只会听到哔哔声。 （我可以默认到系统发出哔哔声，但是我选择了标准的MacOS“瓶子”声音只是为了宏 - 我想知道，这是<em>一个</em>宏使我无法粘贴我错误地认为剪贴板上的任何文字，所以我希望播放一个独特的声音。</p><p>如果剪贴板<em>不</em>包含图像，那么键盘大师会模拟⌘V快捷方式并将其传递给Marsedit，从我作为用户的角度来看，它就像我期望的文本的普通糊状物一样。我有一些这样的宏，其中宏被应用程序自己的键盘快捷键触发，宏将（如果满足某些条件）将通过相同的模拟键盘快捷方式到达应用程序。许多年前，当我第一次尝试此操作时，我一半担心它会触发无限循环，键盘大师宏的模拟击键会重新触发宏。我担心的是错了 - 键盘大师太聪明了。</p><p>您几乎可以肯定的是，偶尔会无意地将图像粘贴到Marsedit上。但是我敢打赌，您有自己的深奥烦恼与您自己最常用的应用程序和最频繁的任务有关。键盘大师可让您有效地将自己的小功能添加到自己喜欢的应用程序中 - 通常根本没有“脚本”。最好的部分是，在撰写这篇博客文章时，我的新“不粘贴图像”使我免于看到诅咒上传的实用程序窗口，因为当我以为我以为我已经在服务器上复制了url时，我在剪贴板上有宏观的屏幕截图。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★键盘Maestro本周：不要粘贴图像</title></entry><entry><title>Yahoo出售TechCrunch </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633950/yahoo-selling-techcrunch-regent-acquisition" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w75" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/yahoo-sold-techcrunch" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41729</id><published> 2025-03-21T19：00：00z</published><updated> 2025-03-21T22：05：18Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>马修·贝洛尼（Matthew Belloni）对帕克（Puck）的Apple TV+有很好的看法（这是一个礼物链接，可以使您通过他们的付费墙，但是需要您创建一个免费帐户，对不起）：</p><blockquote><p>所有这些都陷入了以我午餐约会的自我为中心的恐惧。苹果当前状态对其娱乐业务意味着什么（如果有的话）？毕竟，进入Apple TV+实验的五年多，目前尚不清楚好莱坞的首席执行官蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook and Services）首席埃迪·库（Eddy Cue）在好莱坞要做什么。当然不是赚钱，至少不是传统意义上的。该信息今天<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year?rc=1m8jsa">报道</a>说，苹果在彭博社的一份<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-21/apple-tries-to-rein-in-hollywood-spending-after-years-of-losses">报告</a>称，自2019年以来，苹果在去年的Apple TV+上损失了10亿美元，该报告已被铲出来制作原创节目和电影。这并不是什么都没有的，即使对于一家价值3万亿美元的公司来说，这并不是什么。</p><p>当然，考虑到苹果一直说，“损失”数字有些误导，这是一个主要目标是利用Leo DiCaprio和Reese Witherspoon来增稠其品牌Halo和设备“生态系统”，最终促进其其他业务。但是，根据当今的信息报告和其他估计，Apple TV+在所有数十亿美元方面仍然累积了约4500万订户。</p><p>这远低于迪斯尼+，最大和派拉蒙+，所有这些+在同一时间启动。这些竞争对手的服务与富有图书馆的传统工作室相连，但它们并没有附属于拥有650亿美元现金的公司，并且在10亿人口的设备上也附上了一家设备，这些设备也可以提供捆绑友好的音乐，新闻和游戏。苹果拒绝确认或评论任何数字，但那里的消息人士表明，订户的数量高于4500万，并且子基地的全球性质正在由美国面向美国的研究公司低估。或许。该公司揭示了BS“有史以来最大的周末！”以外的零性能数据！新闻稿称，交易在没有怀疑的情况下接受的，以及像Ben Stiller和David Ellison Post这样的制片人在社交媒体上以“有福的”表情符号。公司外面没有人真正知道Apple TV+业务的表现。</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/puck-apple-tv+-signups.png">这张图表</a>是一个有趣的掘金，这表明自苹果和亚马逊在去年年底通过Prime Video中通过Amazon Channel <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/apple-tv-shows-amazon-prime-video-subscription">出售电视+订阅</a>以来，对电视+的订阅就蓬勃发展。这笔交易似乎使针头移动了。另一个有趣的掘金是，电视+似乎比其他流媒体服务遭受更高的流失率。贝洛尼（Belloni）的冰球同事朱莉娅·亚历山大（Julia Alexander）说：“只有不到35％的订户将服务保留超过六个月。”</p><p>这有点疯狂。我认为电视+的流失率<em>少于</em>行业平均水平，而Apple TV+受众群体很小，但忠诚度。也许这是苹果公司购买新设备时进行3个月试验的毫不奇怪的副作用。但是我也很想知道，电视+订阅是否是行业群体最难衡量的，因为这么多的人通过TVO（或在手机上，在iOS上）订阅所有内容都是私人的。贝洛尼暗示了这一点，并说苹果的小鸟告诉他，电视+订户基础比他们获得的荣誉要大。</p><p>您如何计算<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One</a>订户对TV+的订户群的计算？我关于Cue和Cook关于从事这项业务的思考的模糊理论是，使它成为订阅Apple One的凳子上的几条。苹果将​​带上<em>仅</em>订阅电视+或仅订阅电视+和苹果音乐的订户，但是他们真正想要的是让人们订阅Apple One，因为它包含iCloud存储，几乎可以肯定的是几乎没有搅动。</p><p>贝洛尼关闭：</p><blockquote><p>苹果不会成为第一个涉足专业生产的内容仅撤退的技术强国。 [...]库克和Cue都没有提出过这样的建议，而在短短五年的时间里，苹果已经成为好莱坞演出和电影的可靠合作伙伴和高质量的买家。在某些方面，Apple TV+成为娱乐社区的一部分是非常了不起的。持续的问题是问题。</p></blockquote><p>我将在这里指出，苹果与其他科技公司不同。苹果不是一个<em>快速行动，破坏</em>公司的公司。他们是<em>两次措施，一旦裁员</em>。当他们致力于某件事时，他们倾向于保持投入。而且他们非常擅长玩需要耐心的长游戏，尤其是在进入新市场时。看看苹果工资。 10年前，它在第一年缓慢后被<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pay-showing-signs-could-214558347.html">广泛地抛弃</a>为<a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-pay-was-a-massive-flop-on-black-friday">失败</a>。现在无处不在。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“ Apple TV+实验”上的“ Matthew Belloni”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/belloni-apple-tv">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>苹果在电视+内容上的支出是“损失”还是“成本”？ </title><link href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/apple-appletv-annual-streaming-losses-1236345490/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w72" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41726</id><published> 2025-03-21T16：18：07Z</published><updated> 2025-03-21T18：28：48Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>吉尔·戈德史密斯（Jill Goldsmith），截止日期：</p><blockquote><p>根据引用两个熟悉此事的人的信息，苹果每年损失超过10亿美元的苹果电视+。<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year">该报告称</a>，这家科技巨头自2019年推出Apple TV+以来，每年花费了超过50亿美元的内容，但去年将其修剪约5亿美元。</p></blockquote><p>韦恩·马（Wayne MA）在信息中的报告的标题设定了框架：“<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year">苹果流媒体损失每年10亿美元</a>”  - 这个故事被广泛宣传，几乎每个人都以<em>损失</em>或<em>损失</em>为例。但是，当苹果期望该业务在十年或更长时间以上时，这是<em>损失</em>吗？ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-tv-reportedly-loses-1-billion-a-year-and-thats-okay-for-now/">来自Scharon Harding在MA的ARS Technica的Paywalled报告中的释义</a>：</p><blockquote><p> Apple TV+是Apple的唯一服务，不赚钱并不<em>好</em>，但也可以预期。与其他流媒体服务一样，Apple TV+直到推出后几年才能盈利。该信息所说，一名Apple TV+员工审查了流媒体服务的业务计划，称Apple TV+预计将在其前10年中损失150亿至200亿美元。</p><p>为了进行比较，迪士尼的直接消费者流媒体业务在2020年秋季和2024年4月之间的迪士尼+之间的营业损失<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2025/02/08/disneys-streaming-unit-loses-three-times-more-money-than-disneyland-paris/">为114亿美元</a>。迪士尼的流媒体业务在截至2024年6月29日的财政季度首次盈利。</p></blockquote><p>基本背景的上述两个段落被埋葬了13段。如果苹果期望电视+在红色中运作，而在第一个十年中，则达到15-200亿美元，而在那十年中的一半（ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-tv-launches-november-1-featuring-originals-from-the-worlds-greatest-storytellers/">电视+在2019年11月首次亮相</a>），它将以红色运行到今年的10亿美元，这是否意味着成本与他们的期望完全符合他们的期望？</p><p>这里的暗示是，苹果会惹恼这笔钱，不知道他们在做什么。也许是！但是，如果是这样的话，正是埃迪提示和蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）撒掉这笔钱的策略。如果苹果公司预计电视+将在2024年获得盈利或收支平衡，那么10亿美元的运营损失将是一个故事。但是，就目前而言，这只是一个成本。苹果去年对电费“损失”了多少？</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“苹果在电视上的支出+内容是“损失”还是“成本”？”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iOS 18软件更新不断为已将其关闭的用户重新增强Apple Intelligence </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/ios-18-3-2-apple-intelligence-auto-on/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w71" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/ios-18-updates-reenable-apple-intelligence" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41725</id><published> 2025-03-21T15：11：46Z</published><updated> 2025-03-21T18：07：45Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, with a blockbuster scoop for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. is undergoing a rare shake-up of its executive ranks, aiming to get its artificial intelligence efforts back on track after months of delays and stumbles, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>首席执行官蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）对AI负责人约翰·吉安南德里亚（John Giannandrea）执行产品开发的能力失去了信心，因此他正在越过另一名顶级高管来帮助：Vision Pro创建者Mike Rockwell。 In a new role, Rockwell will be in charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the moves haven&#39;t been announced.</p><p> Rockwell将向软件负责人Craig Federighi报告，将Siri完全从Giannandrea的命令中删除。 Apple is poised to announce the changes to employees this week. The iPhone maker&#39;s senior leaders — a group known as the Top 100 — just met at a secretive, annual offsite gathering to discuss the future of the company.彭博新闻报道，它的AI努力是峰会上的关键谈话点。 [...]</p></blockquote><p>我对此的快速看法是，克雷格·费德里吉（Craig Federighi）刚刚赢得了一场草皮战。这不仅是让新任主管负责Siri，而且还在Federighi小组的领导下将Siri搬到。</p><p>在苹果宣布这些变化（即使在内部）是令人难以置信的，古尔曼（Gurman）如何获得这一独家新闻。这个勺子不是“彭博”。 It&#39;s Mark Gurman.相信我，Apple PR并没有故意将其泄露给他。我敢肯定，他们现在至少在内部加速了公告，以自己的条件为基础。 I can only guess that Gurman hinted at his sourcing in the passage above: Tim Cook must have announced these changes at the Top 100 retreat this week, and at least two of those attendees leaked the news to Gurman.空前的。</p><p>还：</p><blockquote><p> Rockwell is currently the vice president in charge of the Vision Products Group, or VPG, the division that developed Apple&#39;s headset.作为变化的一部分，他将离开那支球队，将in绳交给保罗·米德（Paul Meade），后者曾为罗克韦尔（Rockwell）的《愿景专业人士》（Vision Pro）开展硬件工程。</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find it surprising at all that Rockwell was given this task.</p><blockquote><p>吉安南德里亚（Giannandrea）将继续留在公司，即使罗克韦尔（Rockwell）接管了西里（Siri）。 An abrupt departure would signal publicly that the AI efforts have been tumultuous — something Apple is reluctant to acknowledge. Giannandrea&#39;s other responsibilities include oversight of research, testing and technologies related to AI.该公司还向吉安南德里亚（Giannandrea）报告了一个团队，以调查机器人技术。</p></blockquote><p> This I find a little surprising.但是也许我不应该。我不买古尔曼的论点，即解雇吉安南德里亚会“公开表示AI的努力是动荡的”。 Apple <em>already</em> signaled that publicly <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">when they announced</a> that all of the ambitious features for Siri and Apple Intelligence that were promised for <em>this</em> year&#39;s OS cycle would be postponed until <em>next</em> year&#39;s OS cycle.那是公共骚动。 But I mean, you can see for yourself that Apple&#39;s AI efforts have been “tumultuous” by asking Siri on your iPhone, right now, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it">what month it is</a> .</p><p>苹果需要发出的信号是，他们不会期望在没有对Siri背后的团队进行重大更改的情况下提供更好的Siri。</p><p> But maybe the answer is as simple as that Giannandrea is good at leading and managing teams doing advanced research that is abstracted from product. So move the products out of his division and into Federighi&#39;s, and put someone who knows how to ship directly in charge of Siri. Leave Giannandrea in charge of a division focused on research and technology. Attention has moved on from “machine learning” to LLMs, but Apple&#39;s machine learning game has gotten very good.</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“古尔曼：蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）让迈克·罗克威尔（Mike Rockwell）负责Siri，向Craig Federighi报告"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/gurman-rockwell-siri">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> HealthKit as a Model for an Open Semantic Index From Apple </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/apple-needs-to-get-out-of-the-way-with-ai" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/healthkit-as-a-model-for-an-open-semantic-index-from-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41721</id><published> 2025-03-20T14:08:11Z</published><updated> 2025-03-20T22:48:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#39;s an update I just appended to my post yesterday, after linking to<a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/3/how_apple_could_help_developers_with_ai_and_llms.html">Gus Mueller&#39;s suggestion</a> that Apple open up a semantic index to third-party AI apps:</p><blockquote><p> HealthKit already works a lot like what Mueller is suggesting here (for, say, “SemanticKit”).借助明确的用户许可（可以随时可以撤销）第三方应用程序都可以从您的健康数据中读取和写入。 Apple does a lot of that itself, both through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related things an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are welcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p></blockquote><p>没有人建议苹果应该放弃AI。相反。 They really need to go from being <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it">a joke</a> to being good at it, fast.

<p>Last March, when Apple introduced the then new M3 MacBook Airs, they moved the base model 13-inch M2 MacBook Air into the magic $999 spot in their own lineup, replacing the M1 MacBook Air. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/macbook-air-walmart">But mid-March it was announced that Walmart would begin selling the M1 MacBook Air</a> — in one tech-spec configuration (8 GB RAM, 256 SSD), but three colors (gold, silver, space gray) for just $700.</p><p>今年， <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/apple-announces-with-little-surprise-m4-macbook-airs">苹果取代了MacBook的整个阵容，它以基于M4的型号（包括999美元的首发型号）销售</a>。 Online, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=macbook">Walmart sells a handful of MacBook models now</a> , at, per Walmart&#39;s brand, slightly lower prices than Apple itself. But the one and only MacBook they seem to stock in their retail stores is the classic wedge-shaped M1 MacBook Air — now down to $650.</p><p>现在已经四年了，是的，8 GB RAM和256 GB的存储空间微不足道，但几乎可以肯定，您可以以该价格购买的最好的新笔记本电脑。假设苹果认为这种伙伴关系是成功的，最终他们将不得不用最近的MacBook Air代替。 But I suspect the main reason it&#39;s still the M1 Air (and hasn&#39;t been replaced by, say, the M2 Air) is not about the specs or performance, per se, but rather simply how it looks. It looks like an older MacBook. Walmart might not get an updated MacBook with a more-recent-than-M1 chip until Apple refreshes the industrial design on its current MacBook Airs.</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“ M1 MacBook Air居住在沃尔玛，现在仅$ 650”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/walmart-macbook-air">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “嘿，西里，是哪个月？” </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jehkpm/apple_intelligence_this_apple_intelligence_that/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41719</id><published> 2025-03-19T23:49:43Z</published><updated> 2025-03-20T13：30：59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>News from Apple that I let slip by a few weeks ago, but that seems apt again <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements">today</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence, will soon be available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India.</p><p> These new languages will be accessible in nearly all regions around the world with the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April, and developers can start to test these releases today.</p><p> With the upcoming software updates, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will have access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time, and Apple Intelligence will expand to a new platform in US English with Apple Vision Pro — helping users communicate, collaborate, and express themselves in entirely new ways.</p></blockquote><p> Given that Apple Intelligence <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">isn&#39;t exactly setting the world on fire</a> , I think in the grand scheme of things, it&#39;ll wind up being filed away under “ <em>Oh yeah, remember that?</em> ” that the EU got it 4-5 months after it debuted. （清理照片通常很棒，我真的很喜欢通知摘要，并且现在他们为新闻应用程序残疾而错过了它们；其余的我不使用，而苹果情报中最雄心勃勃的方面（<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">您可能已经听到</a>） <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">延迟了所有人</a>，而不仅仅是欧盟。）</p><p> Apple was concerned that the EU&#39;s hardline interpretation of the DMA was such that the European Commission considered it a violation of the DMA that Apple Intelligence wasn&#39;t an interchangeable component. Like the way the EC forced Apple to open up iOS to alternative app marketplaces — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/eu_reaping_what_it_sows">there was uncertainty</a> whether they&#39;d demand the same for system-integrated AI.如果这是EC所要求的，那么多年来，他们根本不会使系统融合了AI。 But I&#39;m not sure how to square up <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements">today&#39;s decisions</a> — requiring Apple to enable third-party alternatives to system-level features like AirPlay and AirDrop — with an interpretation that the EU will be fine with Apple Intelligence only offering Apple&#39;s own AI (along with Apple&#39;s approved partners, like OpenAI).</p><p>我认为欧盟委员会的政权变化在某种程度上改变了一切，但安静地改变了一切。 Former competition chief Margrethe Vestager was a firebrand.早在去年6月，苹果宣布苹果情报将无限期地推迟iOS的iOS之后，<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/28/withholding-apple-intelligence-from-eu/">她明确表示，<em>她</em>认为这是反竞争的</a>：</p><blockquote><p> “I find that very interesting that they say we will now deploy AI where we&#39;re not obliged to enable competition. I think that is that is the most sort of stunning open declaration that they know 100% that this is another way of disabling competition where they have a stronghold already.”</p></blockquote><p> But Vestager is gone, and until today we hadn&#39;t heard a whit about DMA compliance from her successor, Teresa Ribera. 9月，当导致今天的决定的诉讼开始时，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/20/ec-apple-specification-proceedings">我写道</a>：</p><blockquote><p>还值得注意的是：Margrethe Vestager即将出门，<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/teresa-ribera-brussels-ursula-von-der-leyen-europe/">即将被</a><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad2db1a7-69e8-4369-9cf1-cc4896df4cc7">西班牙社会主义者Teresa Ribera</a>取代，这是一位职业气候专家（可能，可能会使她对苹果的亲和力，远远不够<a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">气候友好的</a>大型技术公司），没有竞争法律经验。对我来说，这使里贝拉成为竞争首席工作的奇怪选择，但显然在欧盟有意义。对于我来说，Ribera是否支持Vestager对DMA指定的“看门人”的十字军东征尚不清楚。如果她不这样做，这一切都是徒劳的吗？</p></blockquote><p> Until today, that remained an open question. Now it appears the Commission&#39;s crusading course is unchanged — it&#39;s just no longer accompanied by inflammatory commentary from the commissioners in charge.</p><div> <a  title="与“ Apple Intelligence将于4月在欧盟将iOS到iOS的永久链接”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/apple-intelligence-is-coming-to-ios-in-the-eu-in-april">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> EU Adopts New &#39;Interoperability&#39; Requirements for Apple Under DMA </title><link href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41717</id><published> 2025-03-19T23:06:52Z</published><updated> 2025-03-20T19：03：47Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The European Commission, today:</p><blockquote><p> Today, the European Commission adopted two decisions under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) specifying the measures that Apple has to take to comply with certain aspects of its interoperability obligation. [...]</p><p> The first set of measures concerns nine iOS connectivity features, predominantly used for connected devices such as smartwatches, headphones or TVs. The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (eg displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (eg peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (eg pairing).</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/19/apple-says-eu-interoperability-requirements-enables-unfettered-access-to-the-iphone-risks-customer-security-and-privacy/">本杰明·梅奥（Benjamin Mayo），报道9to5mac</a> ：</p><blockquote><p> In a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple firmly rebuked the EU decision announced today about specific interoperability requirements the company must implement over the coming months.</p><p> Apple said “Today&#39;s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple&#39;s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don&#39;t have to play by the same rules. It&#39;s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users”.</p><p> In regards to customer privacy, Apple is especially concerned with the requirements surrounding opening up access to the iOS notification system. The company indicated these measures would allow companies to suck up all user notifications in an unencrypted form to their servers, sidestepping all privacy protections Apple typically enforces.</p></blockquote><p> My interpretation of the adopted decision is that the EU is requiring Apple to treat iOS like a PC operating system, like MacOS or Windows, where users can install third-party software that runs, unfettered, in the background.</p><p> Apple&#39;s statement makes clear their staunch opposition to these decisions.但至少在表面上，欧盟委员会的男高音已经改变。 The quotes from the Commission executives (Teresa Ribera, who replaced firebrand Margrethe Vestager as competition chief, and Henna Virkkunen) are anodyne.过去几年中，Vestager和<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/16/breton-resigns">Thierry Breton</a>的名言的效果都没有。 But the decisions themselves make clear that the EU isn&#39;t backing down from its general position of seeing itself as the rightful decision-maker for how iOS should function and be engineered, and that Apple&#39;s core competitive asset — making devices that work better together than those from other companies — isn&#39;t legal under the DMA.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘EU Adopts New ‘Interoperability’ Requirements for Apple Under DMA’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sebastiaan de With&#39;s iPhone 16e Camera Review: &#39;The Essentials&#39; </title><link href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-16e-camera-review-the-essentials/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/de-with-16e-camera" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41716</id><published> 2025-03-19T21:53:15Z</published><updated> 2025-03-19T22:07:21Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Gus Mueller:</p><blockquote><p> A week or so ago I was grousing to some friends that Apple needs to open up things on the Mac so other LLMs can step in where Siri is failing.从理论上讲，我们（开发人员）今天可以做到这一点，但是我很想看到一个有福的系统，苹果为其他LLM提供商提供了API。</p><p> Are there security concerns? Yes, of course there are, there always will be. But I would like the choice.</p><p> The crux of the issue in my mind is this: Apple has a lot of good ideas, but they don&#39;t have a monopoly on them. I would like some other folks to come in and try their ideas out. I would like things to advance at the pace of the industry, and not Apple&#39;s. Maybe with a blessed system in place, Apple could watch and see how people use LLMs and other generative models (instead of giving us Genmoji that look like something Fisher-Price would make). And maybe open up the existing Apple-only models to developers. There are locally installed image processing models that I would love to take advantage of in my apps.</p></blockquote><p> The analogy I used, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/10/yours-truly-guesting-on-upgrade-with-jason-snell">talking with Jason Snell during my guest stint on Upgrade last week</a> , was to the heyday of desktop publishing. The Mac was <em>the</em> platform for graphic design because it was the best platform for using design apps. Fonts worked better and looked better on the Mac. Printing worked better from Macs. Peripherals worked better. The apps themselves looked better on the Mac than they did on Windows. The Mac had taste and designers (hopefully) have taste. Graphic designers could understand how their machines worked, and maintain them themselves, in a way they couldn&#39;t with PCs.</p><p> But Apple didn&#39;t make any of the actual apps. Companies like Adobe and Macromedia and Aldus did. Independent small developers made niche extensions for use inside apps like Photoshop, FreeHand, and QuarkXPress. When a new app came along like InDesign — which quickly ate Quark&#39;s lunch — the Mac remained the dominant platform to use.</p><p> Making a great platform where <em>other developers</em> can innovate is one of Apple&#39;s core strengths. Apple got even <em>better</em> at it once Mac OS X hit its stride in the 2000s — the Cocoa APIs really did empower outside developers to make world-class apps providing experiences that couldn&#39;t be matched on other platforms like Windows or Linux. Then it happened again, with a much bigger audience, with iOS. What desktop publishing was to the Mac in the 1990s, social media was to the iPhone in the 2010s. Apple didn&#39;t make the apps — they made the best platform to use those apps.</p><p> Apple should be laser focused on doing this for AI now. Where I quibble with Mueller is that I don&#39;t want Apple to get out of the way. I want Apple to pave the roads to create the way. Apple doesn&#39;t have to make the cars ( <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/27/1234315814/apple-cancels-electric-car">literally</a> ) — just pave the best roads. Make the Mac <em>the</em> best platform for outside developers to create innovative AI systems and experiences. Make iOS <em>the</em> best consumer device to use AI apps from any outside developer. Work on APIs and frameworks for the AI age. No company has ever been better than Apple at designing and delivering those sort of APIs.倾斜。 It&#39;s as useful, relevant, and profitable an institutional strength (and set of values) today as ever.</p><p> In a follow-up post,<a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/3/how_apple_could_help_developers_with_ai_and_llms.html">Mueller shows he&#39;s thinking like I&#39;m thinking</a> :</p><blockquote><p> But off the top of my head, here&#39;s one idea that I think could really help and reap benefits for both Apple and developers.</p><p> Build a semantic index (SI), and allow apps to access it via permissions given similar to what we do for Address Book or Photos.</p><p> Maybe even make the permissions to the SI a bit more fine-grained than you normally would for other personal databases. Historical GPS locations? Scraping contents of the screen over time? Indexed contents of document folder(s)? Make these options for what goes into the SI.</p><p> And of course, the same would be true for building the SI. As a user, I&#39;d love to be able to say “sure, capture what&#39;s on the screen and scrape the text out of that, but nope - you better not track where I&#39;ve been over time”.</p></blockquote><p> HealthKit already works a lot like what Mueller is suggesting here (for, say, “SemanticKit”).借助明确的用户许可（可以随时可以撤销）第三方应用程序都可以从您的健康数据中读取和写入。 Apple does a lot of that itself, both through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related things an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are welcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Apple Needs to Get Out of the Way With AI’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/apple-needs-to-get-out-of-the-way-with-ai">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;A Delightful and Simple User Experience&#39; </title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/roku-says-unpopular-autoplay-ads-are-just-a-test/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/roku-delightful-and-simple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41713</id><published> 2025-03-19T19:54:15Z</published><updated> 2025-03-19T20:01:42Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Make a decision: color or monochrome. I&#39;d sort of lean toward black-and-white, to differentiate it from Apple Watch and other high-end smartwatches.

Instead of arguing that “Apple restricts Pebble from being awesome with iPhones”, lean into the ways that Pebble can be awesome because it isn&#39;t an Apple Watch. 30-day battery life is awesome. I don&#39;t think Apple Watch will ever offer that. Being able to run whatever apps — including watch faces — that you want on your own Pebble watch is awesome, and I know Apple Watch will never offer that.

<p>Taegan Goddard, writing at Political Wire regarding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-david-shor.html">pollster David Shor&#39;s appearance on Ezra Klein&#39;s podcast</a> :</p><blockquote><p> His surveys indicate a clear causal relationship: People who relied on TikTok for news were much more likely to swing toward Trump than those who got their information from TV. His most striking data point:</p><blockquote><p> When you zoom in on people who get their news from TikTok but don&#39;t care very much about politics, this group is eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago — which is a lot.</p></blockquote><p> What remains unclear is why this shift happened. Was TikTok&#39;s parent company, ByteDance, subtly adjusting its algorithm to undermine Democrats? Or was the platform simply reflecting broader anti-incumbent sentiment? Shor concedes:</p><blockquote><p> You could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok, and Democrats are going to do great now.我真的不知道。但是我认为，无论出于何种原因，这种重大转变确实对共和党人有所帮助。</p></blockquote><p> It used to be that getting your message out required persuading reporters, editors, and gatekeepers — people trained to vet and verify information.</p><p> Now anyone can make a short video, and if it&#39;s compelling enough, it spreads like wildfire — except that it may be following a path predetermined by TikTok&#39;s algorithms.</p></blockquote><p> I worry that the liberal/left response to this will be to declare, with exasperation, that people shouldn&#39;t be getting their news or forming their political opinions by what they see on TikTok.

<p>Random Augustine has written a splendidly nerdy but very approachable overview of the evolution of Apple&#39;s XNU kernel over the last decade:</p><blockquote><p> <em>2017 — Page Protection Layer</em></p><p> With the release of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X containing the A11 processor, Apple introduced a security feature known as the Page Protection Layer (PPL). This hardware+software feature isolated a small part of the kernel and gave it privileges to modify memory page tables — critical structures that manage memory access. The rest of the kernel lost the ability to directly modify these page tables. The PPL&#39;s limited attack surface ensured that bypasses were infamously rare. While PPL added a layer of protection, it was only partly effective as the rest of the kernel still held most privileges required to compromise data without modifying page tables.</p><p> <em>2021–2023 — Secure Page Table Monitor</em></p><p> Following PPL, the release of the iPhone 13 containing the A15 processor introduced new functionality utilised in iOS 17: the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM). This replaced and improved upon the PPL by securing additional memory functions and dividing them into subsystems, further isolating small kernel components. Validation of code signatures, confirming that all code had been signed by Apple was also isolated.</p><p> Around this time, oblique references to exclaves began to surface in XNU source code. These exclaves were speculated to be the subsystems managed by SPTM. Then 2024 happened…</p><p> <em>2024 — Exclaves: A major addition to XNU</em></p><p> With the release of XNU source code supporting M4 and A18 based systems (such as the iPhone 16), the curtain was partly pulled back on exclaves. (Exclaves are not active on prior processors).</p><p> It is now clear that exclaves are part of a much larger redesign of XNU&#39;s security model.</p></blockquote><p> I am reminded of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)">Gall&#39;s Law</a> :</p><blockquote><p> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.</p></blockquote><p> (I also suspect that Siri — today&#39;s Siri at least — might be a canonical example of “a complex system designed from scratch”. But that&#39;s a different topic.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘On Apple Exclaves’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/on-apple-exclaves">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Firefox Users on iOS Have Doubled in France and Germany, From a Very Small Number to a Slightly Less Small Number </title><link href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/firefox-france-germany/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/firefox-ios-doubling-france-and-germany" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41709</id><published> 2025-03-19T18:44:37Z</published><updated> 2025-03-19T19:47:13Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Nick Heer:</p><blockquote><p> They are impressive, but my interpretation of statistics like these is that one often finds percentages used like this when neither actual number is very large.

Surely <em>some</em> number of users who switched to Firefox via the choice screen did so by mistake, because they were confused.</p><p> The best case scenario is that this growth for Firefox (and presumably for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens">other alternate browsers that qualified for the EU choice screens</a> ) means that alternative browsers have gone from a tiny usage share to a twice-as-large-but-still-tiny share, and that most of the growth comes from happy users.

<p>Ten years ago I bought a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro headphones for use while podcasting. My product research was rigorous and exhaustive: I asked Marco Arment which headphones I should buy, he said these, so I bought them. They&#39;re offered in three impedance variants: 32, 80, and 250 ohms. Beyerdynamics describes 80 ohms as the best “allrounder” choice, and that&#39;s what Marco told me to get.</p><p> I&#39;ve since worn them to record at least 275 episodes of The Talk Show (I think <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/07/29/ep-127">this episode</a> was the first) and nearly all of the five-years-and-counting run of Dithering. They sound great, but more importantly, they&#39;re super comfortable. I can wear them for 3+ hours and my ears don&#39;t feel too bad at all. They&#39;re also built to last. Just about everything on mine still looks fairly new, despite my having worn them for something approaching 1,000 hours. No cracking on the cable and the padding on the headband looks new. The one part that <em>didn&#39;t</em> look new were the velour ear pads. Last week I ordered <a href="https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/edt-770-v">replacements from Beyerdynamics for $40</a> ; they arrived earlier this week and I swapped the old pads for new today.</p><p> When I bought my headphones in 2015, they cost $250. Today the price is down to just $170, either <a href="https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/dt-770-pro">direct from Beyerdynamic</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MNAAI?tag=df-amzn-20">from Amazon</a> (that&#39;s a make-me-rich affiliate link). I am not an audiophile, and I literally only use mine for podcasting. But I&#39;ve spent quite a lot time podcasting with them over the last decade. I&#39;ll bet I&#39;m still using the same pair (with another set of fresh ear pads) 10 years from now.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro: Closed Studio Headphones’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://workos.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6j" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/workos_scalable_secure_authent_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41707</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-03-19T14:39:18Z</published><updated> 2025-03-19T14:39:19Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Om Malik:</p><blockquote><p>我有自己的解释，我的读者熟悉了这一点，这是最明显的。 Just as Google is trapped in the 10-blue-link prison, which prevents it from doing something radical, Apple has its own golden handcuffs. It&#39;s a company weighed down by its market capitalization and what stock market expects from it.</p><p>他们缺乏史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）的道德权威来无视市场，简化其产品阵容并集中于公司。取而代之的是，他们做一个复杂的业务经常做的事情：他们会做更多的事情。 Could they have done a better job with iPadOS? Should Vision Pro receive more attention?</p><p> The answer to all those is yes. Apple has become a complex entity that can&#39;t seem to ever have enough resources to provide the real Apple experience.您得到的是“足够好”。 And most of the time, I think it is enough — because what others have on the market is worse. They know how to build great hardware; it&#39;s the software where they falter.就苹果智能而言，它们被捕获了很短，因为其他人的AI产品即使有缺陷，也比苹果自己的产品要好得多。</p></blockquote><p> Hardware inherently keeps a company honest in a way that software doesn&#39;t. Hardware either works or it doesn&#39;t. The only way to “upgrade” hardware is via installing newer software, or by taking the hardware apart and replacing physical components.在任何领域，都很难想到其软件比硬件“更好”的领域。也许是任天堂？ But even with Nintendo, I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like their software is as good as their hardware. Also, an interesting thought that popped into my head reading Malik&#39;s post just now: part of what makes Vision Pro so fascinating is that the software is better than the hardware. The hardware for immersive VR is so early-days that even the industry state-of-the-art — which is Vision Pro — stinks compared to where it&#39;s going to be in even just five years. 1984年的Macintosh是一台肮脏的计算机，带有9英寸的一位显示器，没有硬盘驱动器，并且荒谬的128千摩变ram。 But the software was amazing!</p><p> But the bigger, better point Malik makes is that “good enough” is enough to make Apple&#39;s software seem ahead of its competition. I tried to make this point all the way back in 2007 with “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/11/apple_needs_a_nikon">Apple Needs a Nikon</a> ”, and I think the problem is worse now than it was then. No other company is even vaguely in Apple&#39;s league.但是苹果在软件方面朝着平庸的方向<em>滑行</em>。 It&#39;s very open for debate how far they&#39;ve slipped.我会说，他们没有滑倒，诚实的估算 - 尤其是关于与Siri和Ai有关的一切，他们可以在芽中咬住这一点。 <em>You</em> might argue that they&#39;ve slipped tremendously across the board. But what I don&#39;t think is arguable is that their competition remains below Apple&#39;s league.这就是让库比蒂诺的声音相信一切都很好的原因。 Apple&#39;s the only team in the top tier for UI design.</p><p>苹果可能发生的最好的事情是Google运送Android像素体验，这实际上使iPhone所有者疯狂地嫉妒。 Google无法通过UI设计这样做。 They&#39;re incapable of catching up to Apple on hardware. But maybe on the AI front they can do it.苹果需要一个竞争对手。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Om Malik on Apple Intelligence: ‘FUD, Dud, or Both’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/malik-fud-dud-or-both">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Tesla&#39;s Share Price Has Been Suspect Since Like Forever </title><link href="https://www.ft.com/content/9cc311b7-676b-4539-a682-b3533a76b0fc" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/tesla-suspect" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41702</id><published> 2025-03-17T23:10:22Z</published><updated> 2025-03-17T23:10:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tesla&#39;s share price has been having a <a href="https://stocks.apple.com/Am3FIcwVVSzeUAKbtyv3F1g">hard time of it</a> lately.自从12月以来，该股票的价值损失了大约一半的价值，自从马斯克（Musk）与唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）一起上任以来， <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/tesla-shares-declined-every-week-since-elon-musk-went-to-washington.html">连续7周跌落</a>，上周只有如此大的篮板，在马斯克（Musk）让美国总统将白宫草坪变成奶酪的特斯拉（Tesla）（<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedailyshow/reel/DHHQ7xxBHgk/">遗憾的是，<em>特斯勒</em>（Tesler</a> ）经销商）之后。在整个市场略有上涨的一天，特斯拉股票今天又下降了5％。</p><p> I bookmarked <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9cc311b7-676b-4539-a682-b3533a76b0fc">this Bryce Elder column at the Financial Times</a> back on January 31, and now seems like a good time to link to it:</p><blockquote><p> The usual explanation for when Tesla trading resembles a Pump.fun shitcoin is: “because Elon talks a lot”.这是摩根大通分析师瑞安·布林克曼（Ryan Brinkman），以扩大主题：</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s not clear to us why Tesla shares traded as much as +5% higher in the aftermarket Wednesday, although we have some leading theories. Perhaps it was management&#39;s statement that it had identified an achievable path to becoming worth more than the world&#39;s five most valuable companies taken together (ie, more than the $14.8 trillion combined market capitalizations of Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, &amp; Alphabet).也许管理层的信念是，只有一种产品本身就有可能产生“ 10万亿美元收入的北部”。它甚至可能与2026年管理指南有关（没有提供财务目标，但据说是“史诗般的”），以及2027年和2028年（“荒谬的好”）。</p></blockquote><p> Brinkman, who has a long-standing “underweight” rating on Tesla, is beginning to sound a bit exasperated:</p><blockquote><p>公司的财务业绩和彭博社共同获得收入，利润率，收益和现金流的共识都不断下降，但分析师的价格目标和公司的股价不断上涨。 For instance, Tesla has missed Bloomberg consensus EBIT in 9 of the past 10 quarters by an average of -16.3%.</p></blockquote><p>始终缺少估计是一回事。 What Tesla has been doing is consistently missing <em>lowered</em> estimates. [...]</p><p> Tesla&#39;s biggest asset is hyperbole.夸张越极端，它越有价值。也许下班后市场参与者比特斯拉熊更好地了解动态，因此可以在氛围上停放基本面和贸易。 Or maybe something else entirely is going on.</p></blockquote><p>听起来很像白宫自动购物中心的另一个人。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tesla’s Share Price Has Been Suspect Since Like Forever’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/tesla-suspect">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Michael Tsai&#39;s Roundup of Links and Commentary on My &#39;Something Is Rotten&#39; Piece Last Week </title><link href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/03/13/rotten/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/tsai-rotten" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41701</id><published> 2025-03-17T20：37：43Z</published><updated> 2025-03-17T20:37:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Ray Maker，在DC Rainmaker写作：</p><blockquote><p>这不仅是苹果第一次创建非观察心率传感器，而且更值得注意的是，该公司首次在现有的蓝牙心率标准上启用心率广播。</p><p>然后问题变成：它准确吗？</p><p> Unfortunately, it turns out, that was not the question I should have started with.

<p>I&#39;m a month late linking to it, but Chance Miller wrote a terrific review for 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> The last several releases from Beats, such as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/17/beats-studio-buds-plus-review/">the Studio Buds Plus</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-hands-on-the-most-iconic-beats-headphones-just-got-better/">Solo 4 headphones</a> , have been powered by a custom Beats chip rather than an Apple-designed chip like what&#39;s used in AirPods. For Beats, this has enabled better cross-platform support for Android users, but it&#39;s also come at the cost of several popular features for Apple fans. For example, the Studio Buds Plus lack support for automatic in-ear detection, iCloud pairing, automatic device switching, personalized spatial audio, and more.</p><p> With the Powerbeats Pro 2, Beats has gone back to its roots and opted for an Apple-designed chip. The Powerbeats Pro 2 are powered by Apple&#39;s H2 chip, the same chip used by the latest-generation AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4. This means you get the full suite of Apple-focused audio features.</p></blockquote><p> The degree of shared engineering between Apple&#39;s teams and Beats&#39;s has always seemed odd to me.有时，Beats似乎确实是一个独立的子公司，专注于跨平台耳机，而其他时候，就像他们在不同品牌标签下制作苹果产品一样。 The sweet spot seems to be about where they landed with these Powerbeats 2.</p><blockquote><p> All of the aforementioned features and improvements make Powerbeats Pro 2 an incredibly compelling product, but Beats has one more thing: Powerbeats Pro 2 feature built-in heart rate monitoring.</p><p> Each Powerbeats Pro 2 earbud has a built-in heart rate monitor comprised of four components. First, there&#39;s an LED sensor that emits green LED light at a rate of over 100 pulses per second. This light is emitted through the skin and hits your red blood cells. The photodiode then receives the reflected light from the red blood cells that is modulated by the red blood flow. There&#39;s an optical lens that helps direct and separate the transmitted and received light, along with an accelerometer to ensure accuracy and consistency in data collection.</p><p> Beats adds that the Powerbeats Pro 2&#39;s heart rate sensor technology is derived from Apple&#39;s work on the Apple Watch.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s weird, but cool, that Beats has delivered in-ear heartbeat monitoring before Apple&#39;s own AirPods have. But now it seems like a lock that this will be a feature in AirPods Pro 3, right?</p><p> What I always want in a review I read — and what I try to provide to readers through my own reviews — is a sense of whether a product is for me. Powerbeats Pro 2 aren&#39;t for me — and I know it, because Miller&#39;s review describes them so well. But they seem like a terrific product that a <em>lot</em> of people would prefer to AirPods Pro.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Chance Miller Reviews the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/chance-miller-reviews-the-beats-powerbeats-pro-2">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Michael Gartenberg on the Lessons Apple Learned (and Hopefully Has Not Forgotten) From MobileMe </title><link href="https://x.com/Gartenberg/status/1900589068003491963" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w6b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/gartenberg-apple-mobileme" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41699</id><published> 2025-03-17T19:35:55Z</published><updated> 2025-03-17T19:50:37Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sebastiaan de With, on X, linking to my “Something Is Rotten” piece last week:</p><blockquote><p> Ex-MobileMe team here. This was a brutal time.</p><p> It was so bad that when he presented iCloud onstage, Steve said “I know what you&#39;re thinking: why should I trust them? They&#39;re the ones who gave us MobileMe!”</p></blockquote><p> Michael Gartenberg (who worked at Apple in product marketing for a few years at the tail end of the Jobs era), responded (across <a href="https://x.com/gartenberg/status/1900588567375540671">two</a> <a href="https://x.com/Gartenberg/status/1900589068003491963">tweets</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> When I was at Apple and Apple University was still around there was a whole course on MobileMe and how it was possible that things ended up the way they did. Fascinating to hear all the backstory.</p><p> One of the lessons of the Apple University course was much of the MobileMe debacle was directly because Jobs didn&#39;t care about it. He was too preoccupied with the newest iPhone at the time. He didn&#39;t even introduce the product, a lot of the stuff crossed his desk that he ignored.</p></blockquote><p> Twitter-like social posts enforce brevity, but I suspect Gartenberg would agree that it wasn&#39;t that Jobs didn&#39;t care about MobileMe at all. It was that he didn&#39;t think he had to care enough to devote his personal attention to it. Yes, Apple should offer web-based functionality for some online fundamentals (email, calendar, contacts...) and, more importantly, Apple should provide over-the-air Internet sync for that data between customers&#39; devices. And it should just work, in the way that a hard drive “just works” without Steve Jobs paying close attention to the current state of Apple&#39;s file system team. But then it turned out MobileMe didn&#39;t “just work”, and Jobs decided that he needed to pay laser-focused attention to starting over and building what we now know as iCloud (which is really quite good, very reliable, and I&#39;d say long ago surpassed the “it just works” threshold). <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference_2011">Steve Jobs&#39;s final keynote</a> — at WWDC 2011 — was largely focused on the announcement of iCloud.</p><p> Who&#39;s got that role inside Apple today — someone with high standards, good taste, and clout within the company — for Siri and Apple Intelligence? Someone who is going to say <em>We didn&#39;t care enough about this, but now we need to, and will.</em></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Michael Gartenberg on the Lessons Apple Learned (and Hopefully Has Not Forgotten) From MobileMe’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/gartenberg-apple-mobileme">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Going National: The Drexel Microcomputing Project&#39;</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E9NsaSYWbY" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w69" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/going-national-the-drexel-microcomputing-project" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41697</id><published> 2025-03-17T17:48:31Z</published><updated> 2025-03-17T18:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From Drexel&#39;s YouTube channel:</p><blockquote><p> But far less recognized is that Drexel made the very bold decision of committing all students to purchase a previously unreleased and untested computer from Apple. This was, of course, the Macintosh (introduced in January 1984), which was unlike any previous computer. Drexel&#39;s commitment to the Mac was also of great benefit to Apple, helping to legitimize this brand-new platform, which helped make the Mac a successful product that continues to thrive in education 40 years later.</p><p> This entire initiative, called the Drexel Microcomputer Project, was captured in a 1-hour documentary filmed by David Jones, Dean of the Pennoni Honors College from 2008 to 2014. The film premiered at Drexel in 1985.</p></blockquote><p> I was very fortunate not only to know Dave Jones (who <a href="https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2018/October/Sad-News-on-the-Passing-of-Former-Dean-Dave-Jones">died in 2018</a> ) but to have him as a professor for several film criticism courses (one on westerns, and another on the works of Alfred Hitchcock). I was a computer science major, not a film major, but Jones didn&#39;t care. He was also familiar with — dare I say, a fan of — my column in <a href="https://www.thetriangle.org/">The Triangle</a> , Drexel&#39;s student newspaper. He took me to lunch my senior year and encouraged me to pursue writing as a career. He was a great teacher: thoughtful, kind, insightful, open-minded, and deeply knowledgeable.</p><p> I saw a screening of <em>Going National</em> back in 2011, and sat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-vCnurOBf8">a panel discussion with Jones to talk about it</a> . It&#39;s a good documentary, and he really captured the feel of Drexel&#39;s campus at the time. It is a very <em>&#39;80s</em> movie.

He publishes an extraordinary number of exclusives, both regarding leaks of upcoming products, and leaks <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/apple-s-siri-chief-calls-ai-delays-ugly-and-embarrassing-promises-fixes">like this Siri team meeting</a> .</li><li> Gurman <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">often</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad">gets</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads">things</a> wrong, and when he does, he never acknowledges those mistakes, let alone corrects them. He also tries to take credit for having called things <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/your-source-for-scoops">he completely missed</a> . He&#39;s not an oracle but presents himself as one. And he writes for a publication, Bloomberg, that shares his insistence on never acknowledging let alone correcting mistakes, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con">even massive ones</a> . What gives me such joy pointing out his boners isn&#39;t that he made them in the first place but that he refuses to acknowledge they happened, presenting an air of infallibility with a provably fallible track record.</li></ul><p> In short, I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/member/2025/03/the-pinata-of-apple-rumors/">do actually suspect</a> — but can claim zero sources familiar with the matter to confirm — that Gurman hangs his toilet paper in an improper underhand fashion.</p><p> So let&#39;s just examine how extraordinary and singular Gurman&#39;s Friday report was. Nobody else reported on this meeting. <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250314/p18#a250314p18">Every other article about it</a> — including mine — was commenting on Gurman&#39;s exclusive report about the meeting. I&#39;ve not seen one other report even confirming the meeting took place, let alone describing it in detail, replete with copious quotes from Siri senior director Robby Walker, who, according to Gurman, led the meeting.不是一个。 I&#39;m not pointing that out to cast suspicion that the meeting did not take place or that Gurman&#39;s report cast it inaccurately or that his direct quotations were not, in fact, direct quotations. I&#39;m pointing out just how singular and extraordinary Mark Gurman is in this sphere. If it wasn&#39;t for Gurman&#39;s report we, outside Apple (and probably outside the Siri team inside Apple) wouldn&#39;t even know the meeting occurred.</p><p> How did Gurman not only get the scoop on this meeting, but copious direct quotes from Walker&#39;s remarks to the team? Well, it was “according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the gathering was private”. In other words, more than one member of the Siri team, and at least one of which either recorded the meeting surreptitiously and slipped the recording to Gurman, or at least one of whom takes notes at the pace and accuracy of a court stenographer. Either way, these sources — plural — surely knew how the meeting would make Apple look if it were to leak.</p><p> I&#39;ve long made my opinions about Bloomberg&#39;s institutional journalistic credibility well known. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;re bereft of credibility — it&#39;s the fact that they are deservedly well-regarded that makes their refusal to ever admit their own glaring mistakes so notable. When a Gurman reports says “people” that means “more than one” and, I believe, he must be able to confirm to his editors that he got this information from more than one source. If he&#39;s reporting direct quotes, I think that means he&#39;s heard a recording. That&#39;s extraordinary.</p><p> But I&#39;d feel a lot better about our collective conventional wisdom regarding the nature of this particular all-hands Siri meeting if it had leaked to, and been reported on by, more than one reporter at more than one publication.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ A Postscript on the Singular Nature of Mark Gurman&#39;s Reporting </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5q" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41678</id><published> 2025-03-12T23:37:14Z</published><updated> 2025-03-22T16：32：20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Who decided these personalized Siri features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they&#39;d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment?

<p>In the two decades I&#39;ve been in this racket, I&#39;ve never been angrier at myself for missing a story than I am about Apple&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">announcement on Friday</a> that the “more personalized Siri” features of Apple Intelligence, scheduled to appear between now and WWDC, would be delayed until “the coming year”.</p><p> I should have my head examined.</p><p> This announcement dropped as a surprise, and certainly took me by surprise to some extent, but it was all there from the start. I should have been pointing out red flags starting back at WWDC last year, and I am embarrassed and sorry that I didn&#39;t see what should have been very clear to me from the start.</p><p> How I missed this is twofold. First, I&#39;d been lulled into complacency by Apple&#39;s track record of consistently shipping pre-announced products and features. Their record in that regard wasn&#39;t perfect, but the exceptions tended to be around the edges. (Nobody was particularly clamoring for Apple to make a multi-device inductive charging mat, so it never generated too much controversy <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features#fn1-2025-03-07">when AirPower turned out to be a complete bust</a> .) Second, I was foolishly distracted by the “Apple Intelligence” brand umbrella. It&#39;s a fine idea for Apple to brand its AI features under an umbrella term like that, similar to how a bunch of disparate features that allow different Apple devices to interoperate are under the “ <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> ” umbrella. But there&#39;s no such thing, technically speaking, as “Continuity”. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s an Xcode project inside Apple named Continuity.xcodeproj, and all the code that supports everything from AirDrop to Sidecar to iPhone Mirroring to clipboard sharing is all implemented in the same framework of code. It&#39;s a marketing term, but a useful one — it helps Apple explain the features, and helps users understand them.</p><p> The same goes for “Apple Intelligence”. It doesn&#39;t exist as a single thing or project. It&#39;s a marketing term for a collection of features, apps, and services. Putting it all under a single obvious, easily remembered — and <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/design/print-design-publishing/apples-new-billboard-ads-are-um-not-great">easily promoted</a> — name makes it easier for users to understand that Apple is launching a new initiative. It also makes it easier for Apple to just say “ <em>These are the devices that qualify for all of these features, and other devices — older ones, less expensive ones — get none of them.</em> ”</p><p> Let&#39;s say Apple were to quietly abandon the dumb Image Playground app next year. It just disappears from iOS 19 and MacOS 16. That would just be Apple eliminating a silly app that almost no one uses or should use. That wouldn&#39;t be a setback or rollback of “Apple Intelligence”. I would actually argue that axing Image Playground would improve Apple Intelligence; its mere existence greatly lowers the expectations for how good the whole thing is. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-12">1</a></sup></p><p> What I mean by that is that it was clear to me from the WWDC keynote onward that some of the features and aspects of Apple Intelligence were more ambitious than others. Some were downright trivial; others were proposing to redefine how we will do our jobs and interact with our most-used devices. That was clear. But yet somehow I didn&#39;t focus on it. Apple itself strongly hinted that the various features in Apple Intelligence wouldn&#39;t all ship at the same time. What they didn&#39;t spell out, but anyone could intuit, was that the more trivial features would ship first, and the more ambitious features later. That&#39;s where the red flags should have been obvious to me.</p><p> In broad strokes, there are four stages of “doneness” or “realness” to features announced by any company:</p><ol><li><p> Features that the company&#39;s own product representatives will demo, themselves, in front of the media. Smaller, more personal demonstrations are more credible than on-stage demos. But the stakes for demo fail are higher in an auditorium full of observers.</p></li><li><p> Features that the company will allow members of the media (or other invited outside observers and experts) to try themselves, for a limited time, under the company&#39;s supervision and guidance. Vision Pro demos were like this at WWDC 2023. A bunch of us got to use pre-release hardware and in-progress software for 30 minutes. It wasn&#39;t like free range “Do whatever you want” — it was a guided tour. But we were the ones actually using the product. Apple allowed hands-on demos for a handful of media (not me) at Macworld Expo <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/186251/ihnatkoiphone.html">back in 2007 with prototype original iPhones</a> — some of the “apps” were just screenshots, but most of the iPhone actually worked.</p></li><li><p> Features that are released as beta software for developers, enthusiasts, and the media to use on their own devices, without limitation or supervision.</p></li><li><p> Features that actually ship to regular users, and hardware that regular users can just go out and buy.</p></li></ol><p> As of today — March 2025 — every feature in Apple Intelligence <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/26/this-is-every-apple-intelligence-feature-thats-available-now/">that has actually shipped</a> was at level 1 back at WWDC. After the keynote, dozens of us in the press were invited to a series of small-group briefings where we got to watch Apple reps demo features like Writing Tools, Photos Clean Up, Genmoji, and more. We got to see predictive code completion in Xcode. What has shipped, as of today, they were able to show, in some functional state, in June.</p><p> For example, there was a demo involving a draft email message on an iPad, and the Apple rep used Writing Tools to make it “more friendly”. I was in a group of just four or five other members of the media, watching this. As usual, we were encouraged to interrupt with questions. Knowing that LLMs are non-deterministic, I asked whether, as the Apple rep was performing this same demo for each successive group of media members, the “more friendly” result was exactly the same each time. He laughed and said no — that while the results are very similar each time, and he hopes they continue to be (hence the laughing), there were subtle differences <em>sometimes</em> between different runs of the same demo. As I recall, he even used Undo to go back to the original message text, invoked Writing Tools to make it “more friendly” again, and we could see that a few of the word choices were slightly different. That answered both my explicit question and my implicit one: Writing Tools generates non-deterministic results, and, more importantly, what we were watching really was a live demo.</p><p> We didn&#39;t get to try any of the Apple Intelligence features ourselves. There was no Apple Intelligence “hands on”. But we did see a bunch of features demoed, live, by Apple folks. In my above hierarchy of realness, they were all at level 1.</p><p> But we didn&#39;t see <em>all</em> aspects of Apple Intelligence demoed. None of the “more personalized Siri” features, the ones that Apple, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">in its own statement announcing their postponement</a> , described as having “more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps”. Those features encompass three main things:</p><ul><li> “Personal context” — Knowing details and information about you from a “semantic index”, built from the contents of your email, messages, files, contacts, and more. In theory, eventually, all the information on your device that you wish to share with Siri will be in this semantic index. If you can look it up on your device, Siri will be able to look it up on your device.</li><li> “Onscreen awareness” — Giving Siri awareness of whatever is displayed on your screen. <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple&#39;s own example usage</a> : “If a friend texts you their new address, you can say &#39;Add this address to their contact card,&#39; and Siri will take care of it.”</li><li><p> “In-app actions” — Giving Siri the ability, through the App Intents framework, to do things in and across apps that <em>you</em> can do, the old fashioned way (yourself) in and across apps. Again, here&#39;s Apple&#39;s own example usage:</p><blockquote><p> You can make a request like “Send the email I drafted to April and Lilly” and Siri knows which email you&#39;re referencing and which app it&#39;s in. And Siri can take actions across apps, so after you ask Siri to enhance a photo for you by saying “Make this photo pop,” you can ask Siri to drop it in a specific note in the Notes app — without lifting a finger.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p> There were no demonstrations of <em>any</em> of that. Those features were all at level 0 on my hierarchy. That level is called vaporware. They were features Apple <em>said</em> existed, which they <em>claimed</em> would be shipping in the next year, and which they <em>portrayed</em> , to great effect, in the signature “Siri, when is my mom&#39;s flight landing?” segment of the WWDC keynote itself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=4934">starting around the 1h:22m mark</a> . Apple was either unwilling or unable to demonstrate those features in action back in June, even with Apple product marketing reps performing the demos from a prepared script using prepared devices.</p><p> This shouldn&#39;t have just raised a concern in my head. It should have set off blinding red flashing lights and deafening klaxon alarms.</p><p> Even the very engineers working on a project never know exactly how long something is going to take to complete. An outsider observing a scripted demo of incomplete software knows far less (than the engineers) just how much more work it needs. But you can make a rough judgment. And that&#39;s where my aforementioned hierarchy of realness comes into play. Even outsiders can judge how close a public beta (stage 3) feels to readiness. A feature or product that Apple will allow the press to play with, hands-on (stage 2) is further along than a feature or product that Apple is only willing to demonstrate themselves (stage 1).</p><p> But a feature or product that Apple is unwilling to demonstrate, at all, is unknowable. Is it mostly working, and close to, but not quite, demonstratable? Is it only kinda sorta working — partially functional, but far from being complete? Fully functional but prone to crashing — or in the case of AI, prone to hallucinations and falsehoods? Or is it complete fiction, just an idea at this point?</p><p> What Apple showed regarding the upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was <em>not</em> a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">The Apple that commissioned the futuristic “Knowledge Navigator” concept video</a> in 1987 was the Apple that was on a course to near-bankruptcy a decade later. Modern Apple — the post-NeXT-reunification Apple of the last quarter century — does not publish concept videos. They only demonstrate actual working products and features.</p><p> Until WWDC last year, that is.</p><p> My deeply misguided mental framework for “Apple Intelligence” last year at WWDC was something like this: <em>Some of these features are further along than others, and Apple is showing us those features in action first, and they will surely be the features that ship first over the course of the next year. The other features must be coming to demonstratable status soon.</em> But the mental framework I should have used was more like this: <em>Some of these features are merely table stakes for generative AI in 2024, but others are ambitious, groundbreaking, and, given their access to personal data, potentially dangerous. Apple is only showing us the table-stakes features, and isn&#39;t demonstrating any of the ambitious, groundbreaking, risky features.</em></p><p>情况变得更糟。 Come September, Apple held its annual big event at Apple Park to unveil the iPhone 16 lineup. Apple Intelligence features were highlighted in the announcement. Members of the media from around the world were gathered. That was a new opportunity, three months after WWDC, for Apple to demonstrate — or even better, offer hands-on access to the press to try themselves — the new personalized Siri features.他们没有。 No demos, at all. But they did promote them, once again, in the event keynote. <sup id="fnr2-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn2-2025-03-12">2</a></sup></p><p> But yet while Apple still wouldn&#39;t demonstrate these features in person, they did commission and broadcast a TV commercial showing these purported features in action, presenting them as a reason to purchase a new iPhone — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature">a commercial they pulled, without comment, from YouTube this week</a> .</p><p> Last week&#39;s announcement — “It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year” — was, if you think about it, another opportunity to demonstrate the current state of these features. Rather than simply issue a statement to the media, they could have invited select members of the press to Apple Park, or Apple&#39;s offices in New York, or even just remotely over a WebEx conference call, and demonstrated the current state of these features live, on an actual device.那没有发生。 If these features exist in any sort of working state at all, no one outside Apple has vouched for their existence, let alone for their quality.</p><h2> Duke Nukem Intelligence</h2><p> Why did Apple show these personalized Siri features at WWDC last year, and promise their arrival during the first year of Apple Intelligence? Why, for that matter, do they now claim to “anticipate rolling them out in the coming year” if they still currently do not exist in demonstratable form? (If they <em>do</em> exist today in demonstratable form, they should, you know, <em>demonstrate them</em> .)</p><p> I&#39;m not trying to be obtuse here. It&#39;s obvious why some executives at Apple might have <em>hoped</em> they could promote features like these at WWDC last year. Generative AI is the biggest thing to happen in the computer industry since previous breakthroughs this century like mobile (starting with the iPhone, followed by Android), social media (Meta), and cloud computing (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon). Nobody knows where it&#39;s going but wherever it&#39;s heading, it&#39;s going to be big, important, and perhaps profitable. Wall Street certainly noticed. And prior to WWDC last year, Apple wasn&#39;t in the game. They needed to pitch their AI story. And a story that involved nothing but table-stakes AI features isn&#39;t nearly as compelling a story as one that involves innovative, breakthrough, ambitious personal features.</p><p> But while there&#39;s an obvious appeal to Apple pitching the most compelling, most ambitious AI story possible, the only thing that was essential was telling a story that was true. If the truth was that Apple only had features ready to ship in the coming year that were table stakes compared to the rest of the industry, that&#39;s the story they needed to tell. Put as good a spin on it as possible, but them&#39;s the breaks when you&#39;re late to the game.</p><p> The fiasco here is not that Apple is late on AI. It&#39;s also not that they had to announce an embarrassing delay on promised features last week. Those are problems, not fiascos, and problems happen. They&#39;re inevitable. Leaders prove their mettle and create their legacies not by how they deal with successes but by how they deal with — how they acknowledge, understand, adapt, and solve — problems. The fiasco is that Apple pitched a story that wasn&#39;t true, one that <em>some</em> people within the company surely understood wasn&#39;t true, and they set a course based on that.</p><p> The Apple of the Jobs exile years — the Sculley / Spindler / Amelio Apple of 1987–1997 — promoted all sorts of amazing concepts that were no more real than the dinosaurs of <em>Jurassic Park</em> , and promised all sorts of hardware and (especially) software that never saw the light of day. Promoting what you <em>hope</em> to be able to someday ship is way easier and more exciting than promoting what you <em>know</em> is actually ready to ship. However close to financial bankruptcy Apple was when Steve Jobs returned as CEO after the NeXT reunification, the company was already completely bankrupt of credibility. Apple today is the most profitable and financially successful company in the history of the world. Everyone notices such success, and the corresponding accumulation of great wealth. Less noticed, but to my mind the more impressive achievement, is that over the last three decades, the company <em>also</em> accumulated an abundant reserve of credibility. When Apple showed a feature, you could bank on that feature being real. When they said something was set to ship in the coming year, it would ship in the coming year. In the worst case, maybe that “year” would have to be stretched to 13 or 14 months. You can stretch the truth and maintain credibility, but you can&#39;t maintain credibility with bullshit. And the “more personalized Siri” features, it turns out, were bullshit.</p><p> Keynote by keynote, product by product, feature by feature, year after year after year, Apple went from a company that you couldn&#39;t believe would even remain solvent, to, by far, the most credible company in tech. Apple remains at no risk of financial bankruptcy (and in fact remains the most profitable company in the world). But their credibility is now damaged. Careers will end before Apple might ever return to the level of “if they say it, you can believe it” credibility the company had earned at the start of June 2024.</p><p> <em>Damaged</em> is arguably too passive. It was <em>squandered</em> . This didn&#39;t happen to Apple. Decision makers within the company did it.</p><p> <em>Who</em> decided these features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they&#39;d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment? Three months later, who decided Apple should double down and advertise these features in a TV commercial, and promote them as a selling point of the iPhone 16 lineup — not just any products, but the very crown jewels of the company and the envy of the entire industry — when those features still remained in such an unfinished or perhaps even downright non-functional state that they <em>still</em> could not be demoed to the press? Not just couldn&#39;t be shipped as beta software. Not just couldn&#39;t be used by members of the press in a hands-on experience, but could not even be shown to work by Apple employees on Apple-controlled devices in an Apple-controlled environment? But yet they advertised them in a commercial for the iPhone 16, when it turns out they won&#39;t ship, in the best case scenario, until months after the iPhone 17 lineup is unveiled?</p><p> When that whole campaign of commercials appeared, I — along with many other observers — was distracted by the fact that <em>none</em> of the features in Apple Intelligence had yet shipped. It&#39;s highly unusual, and arguably ill-considered, for Apple to advertise <em>any</em> features that haven&#39;t yet shipped. But one of those commercials was not at all like the others. The other commercials featured Apple Intelligence features that were close to shipping. We know today they were close to shipping because they were either in the iOS 18.1 betas already, in September, or would soon appear in developer betas for iOS 18.2 and 18.3. Right now, today, they&#39;ve all actually shipped and are in the hands of iPhone 16 users. But the “Siri, what&#39;s the name of the guy I had a meeting with a couple of months ago at Cafe Grenel?” commercial was entirely based on a feature Apple still has never even demonstrated.</p><p> Who said “ <em>Sure, let&#39;s promise this</em> ” and then “ <em>Sure, let&#39;s advertise it</em> ”? And who said “ <em>Are you crazy, this isn&#39;t ready, this doesn&#39;t work, we can&#39;t promote this now?</em> ” And most important, who made the call which side to listen to? Presumably, that person was Tim Cook.</p><p> Even with everything Apple overpromised (if not outright lied about) at the WWDC keynote, the initial takeaway from WWDC from the news media was wrongly focused on their partnership with OpenAI. The conventional wisdom coming out of the keynote was that Apple had just announced something called “Apple Intelligence” but it was powered by ChatGPT, when in fact, the story Apple told was that they — Apple — had built an entire system called Apple Intelligence, entirely powered by Apple&#39;s own AI technology, and that it spanned from on-device execution all the way to a new Private Cloud Compute infrastructure they not only owned but are powering with their own custom-designed server hardware based on Apple Silicon chips. And that on top of all that, as a proverbial cherry on top, Apple <em>also</em> was adding an optional integration layer with ChatGPT.</p><p> So, yes, given that the news media gave credit for Apple&#39;s own actual announced achievements to OpenAI, Apple surely would have been given even <em>less</em> credit had they not announced the “more personalized Siri” features. It&#39;s easy to imagine someone in the executive ranks arguing “ <em>We need to show something that only Apple can do.</em> ” But it turns out they announced something Apple <em>couldn&#39;t</em> do. And now they look so out of their depth, so in over their heads, that not only are they years behind the state-of-the-art in AI, but they don&#39;t even know <em>what</em> they can ship or <em>when</em> . Their headline features from nine months ago not only haven&#39;t shipped but still haven&#39;t even been demonstrated, which I, for one, now presume means they <em>can&#39;t</em> be demonstrated <em>because they don&#39;t work</em> .</p><h2> &#39;So Why the Fuck Doesn&#39;t It Do That?&#39;</h2><p> In May 2011, <a href="https://fortune.com/article/inside-apple/">Fortune published an extraordinary look inside Apple by Adam Lashinsky</a> , at what we now know to be the peak, and (alas) end, of the Steve Jobs era. The piece opens thus:</p><blockquote><p> Apple doesn&#39;t often fail, and when it does, it isn&#39;t a pretty sight at 1 Infinite Loop. In the summer of 2008, when Apple launched the first version of its iPhone that worked on third-generation mobile networks, it also debuted MobileMe, an e-mail system that was supposed to provide the seamless synchronization features that corporate users love about their BlackBerry smartphones. MobileMe was a dud. Users complained about lost e-mails, and syncing was spotty at best. Though reviewers gushed over the new iPhone, they panned the MobileMe service.</p><p> Steve Jobs doesn&#39;t tolerate duds. Shortly after the launch event, he summoned the MobileMe team, gathering them in the Town Hall auditorium in Building 4 of Apple&#39;s campus, the venue the company uses for intimate product unveilings for journalists. According to a participant in the meeting, Jobs walked in, clad in his trademark black mock turtleneck and blue jeans, clasped his hands together, and asked a simple question:</p><p> “Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?” Having received a satisfactory answer, he continued, “So why the fuck doesn&#39;t it do that?”</p><p> For the next half-hour Jobs berated the group. “You&#39;ve tarnished Apple&#39;s reputation,” he told them. “You should hate each other for having let each other down.” The public humiliation particularly infuriated Jobs. Walt Mossberg, the influential Wall Street Journal gadget columnist, had panned MobileMe. “Mossberg, our friend, is no longer writing good things about us,” Jobs said. On the spot, Jobs named a new executive to run the group.</p></blockquote><p> Tim Cook should have already held a meeting like that to address and rectify this Siri and Apple Intelligence debacle. If such a meeting hasn&#39;t yet occurred or doesn&#39;t happen soon, then, I fear, that&#39;s all she wrote. The ride is over. When mediocrity, excuses, and bullshit take root, they take over. A culture of excellence, accountability, and integrity cannot abide the acceptance of any of those things, and will quickly collapse upon itself with the acceptance of all three.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-12"><p> Image Playground would make a ton of sense not as a consumer-facing app, but as an example project for developers. Long ago, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/TextEdit/Introduction/Intro.html">used to share the source code for TextEdit</a> as an example project for Mac developers. (TextEdit is actually a low-key great application, though. It&#39;s genuinely useful, reliable, and understandable.) <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/wwdc/2024/">Apple shares tons of sample code at WWDC each year</a> . Image Playground would be a great sample project. The silly app icon even looks like something from a WWDC sample project. What Image Playground is <em>not</em> is a credible useful generative AI tool. Yet Apple keeps talking about it — and showing it off in new hardware demonstrations — like it&#39;s something they should be proud of and that anyone might credibly use for real-world work or even personal purposes. Image Playground does exemplify just how state-of-the-art the generative AI features are in Apple Intelligence, but not in the way Apple seems to think. <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-03-12"><p> Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uarNiSl_uh4?t=3184">the 53-minute mark of Apple&#39;s September “It&#39;s Glowtime” event</a> introducing the iPhones 16, and it&#39;s Craig Federighi who says the following:</p><blockquote><p> “Siri will be able to tap into your personal context to help you in ways that are unique to you. Like pulling up the recommendation for the TV show that your brother sent you last month. And Siri will gain onscreen awareness. So when your friend texts you about a new album, you&#39;ll be able to simply say, &#39;Play that.&#39; And then you&#39;ll be able to take hundreds of new actions in your apps, like updating a friend&#39;s contact card with his new address, or adding a set of photos to a specific album. With Siri&#39;s personal context understanding and action capabilities, you&#39;ll be able to simply say, &#39;Send Erica the photos from Saturday&#39;s barbecue&#39;, and Siri will dig up the photos and send them right off.”</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s about 40 seconds of keynote time I bet Federighi regrets — and that I suspect <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/09/siri-apple-intelligence-ios-18-development-went-wrong/">he was skeptical about</a> including.尽管如此，与WWDC不同，苹果没有<em>显示</em>这些功能，甚至在iPhone 16活动上花了整整一分钟的时间 - 尽管表面上看，这些功能本来应该比6月更接近运费的三个月。 Federighi&#39;s title is SVP of software, and Apple Intelligence and Siri are “software”, but John Giannandrea (SVP of machine learning and AI strategy) is Federighi&#39;s peer, not subordinate, <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">on the org chart</a> — both report directly to Tim Cook — and is responsible for Siri and Apple Intelligence. Why it was Federighi, not Giannandrea, pitching those features in the iPhone 16 event keynote almost certainly comes down to Federighi&#39;s presentation skills and stage presence, not responsibility for the features themselves. But who&#39;s going on camera to pitch these features and promise their future availability the next time? <a href="#fnr2-2025-03-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/new_ui_look_ios_would_be_a_huge_deal" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5l" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41673</id><published> 2025-03-11T22:33:03Z</published><updated> 2025-03-12T14：23：06Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> You either have taste or you don&#39;t, and most people don&#39;t, at least for judging something new and unfamiliar. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/11/a-totally-new-look-for-ios-19-will-likely-have-a-bigger-impact-than-new-siri/">Ben Lovejoy, writing at 9to5Mac</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Our editor-in-chief Chance Miller wryly commented that a radical new look would serve as a great way to distract from the ever-slowing progress on the new Siri. But in truth, I think many more Apple users will be wowed by a new look than would ever care about Siri.</p></blockquote><p> If that&#39;s the way it works out — with a new visual look drawing attention from lackluster progress on the AI front — surely the timing will be coincidental, but some accidents are happy accidents, as Bob Ross used to say.</p><blockquote><p> Sure, the new look introduced with iOS 7 was a massively controversial one, and many thought that then Apple design chief Jony Ive should never have been allowed anywhere near the software side of the business. But love it or hate it, you certainly couldn&#39;t ignore it.</p><p> The same will be true of a new 3D look, which might even include some (much more modern) skeuomorphic elements. Probably as many will hate it as love it when it&#39;s first introduced, as that seems to be true of any significant change made by the company, but it will likely make more of a bang than any improvement to Siri the company may introduce, then or later.</p></blockquote><p> There should be no question that all of what Lovejoy is saying here is true. If Apple launches an all-new systemwide UI theme for iOS 19, something even half as radical a change as iOS 7&#39;s theme was, it will be the <em>only</em> thing most users notice or opine about. Humans are fundamentally visual creatures and we notice visual changes. And, most humans are resistant to change. A lot of people simply dislike change, even changes for the better. (Honestly, I think that&#39;s what the iOS 18 Photos complaints are about. Complaints about change itself.)</p><p> Part of what makes Apple <em>Apple</em> is that the company is (or at least should be) led by people who both have great taste and trust their own instincts. No one&#39;s taste is perfect. Even Steve Jobs pushed through a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/08/siracusa-ive">few</a> <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/apple-history/flower-power-imac-blue-dalmatian">clunkers</a> . But if you have great taste and confidence, you&#39;ll do what your gut says is right.</p><p> When a company only pushes out changes that avoid controversy, it leads to paralysis. Then stagnation. Earlier today, <a href="https://social.panic.com/@cabel/114144740571928406">Cabel Sasser wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> One of my strongest early developer memories was being in the “UI Feedback Forum” at WWDC after they introduced Aqua. Think of a live Q&amp;A, but developers giving notes to a team of Apple engineers.</p><p> To these veteran Mac coders, the reaction to Aqua was universally negative. People were actively very angry.这是浪费！丑陋！令人困惑！ How could you. It went on and on, and I was surprised because Aqua looked cool and fun to me.</p><p> After that WWDC, they never did another Feedback Forum.</p></blockquote><p>是的。 What a lot of Mac users wanted was a Mac OS X that looked like Mac OS 9. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-11"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-11">1</a></sup> The Aqua look and feel was definitely polarizing. And Apple dialed back its most exuberant details with each subsequent Mac OS X update — less transparency, subtler pinstripes (pinstripes!), etc. But iOS 7 was equally polarizing, and its excesses also got dialed back (or perhaps better, said, dialed back up) with each successive iOS release — a little more depth, some subtle hints of texture.</p><p> Either Apple is <em>never</em> going to ship an altogether new UI theme, or they&#39;ll ship one and a large number of people will declare it utter garbage and proof that Apple has completely lost its way. Maybe it <em>will</em> be garbage and proof that Apple has lost its way! Or, maybe it will actually prove to be a great new look that starts a decade-long industry-wide trend that all other companies will soon follow — which is what happened with Aqua&#39;s 3D “lickability”, and happened again with iOS 7&#39;s austere flattening. But either way, you won&#39;t be able to judge it by asking for a show of hands from the general population <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design">when it&#39;s unveiled</a> .

<p>Here&#39;s a statement I got this morning from Apple spokeswoman Jacqueline Roy, verbatim:</p><blockquote><p> “Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we&#39;ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We&#39;ve also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”</p></blockquote><p> This is a Friday sort of <em>wah-waaah</em> sad-trombone news drop, but it&#39;s good that Apple is getting on top of it, and setting expectations accurately.</p><p> Reading between the lines, and based on my PhD-level fluency in Cupertino-ese, what Apple is saying here is that these “more personalized Siri” features are being punted from this year&#39;s OS cycle to next year&#39;s: to iOS 19 and MacOS 16. Apple&#39;s <em>years</em> in this context aren&#39;t calendar years, but Apple&#39;s OS product years. Those years effectively start at WWDC. The problem, from Apple&#39;s perspective, messaging-wise, is that they don&#39;t talk about future products. They haven&#39;t officially acknowledged there is going to be an iOS 19 or MacOS 16. They haven&#39;t even yet announced that there&#39;s going to be a WWDC 2025. But they do want to set expectations accurately, especially for a feature as high profile — from Apple&#39;s own marketing push — as Apple Intelligence.所以我们在这里。</p><p> It was already pretty obvious these features weren&#39;t coming in iOS 18.4/MacOS 15.4, because they&#39;re not in the developer betas that are already out. And if these features were coming in iOS 18.5/MacOS 15.5, or even iOS 18.6/MacOS 15.6, Apple wouldn&#39;t have felt the need to issue this “It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought...” statement today. Delivering the “more personalized Siri” in iOS 18.5 or even 18.6 would have been delivering them on the originally announced schedule — the “coming year” that began with WWDC 2024. That would have been the tail end of that “year”, but within it. But Apple, being limited to the self-imposed opaque verbiage of Cupertino-ese, isn&#39;t going to spell that out. But trust me, you can bank on it: what they&#39;re announcing today is that these features are coming in iOS 19/MacOS 16.</p><p> Siri <em>has</em> improved in several useful, but iterative, ways under the Apple Intelligence umbrella in this year&#39;s OS cycle (iOS/iPadOS 18 + MacOS 15 Sequoia), but the big “more personalized Siri” that was shown at WWDC last June is the Siri-related Apple Intelligence stuff that people are, justifiably, most excited about. This is the “ <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/integrating-actions-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence">App Intents</a> ” stuff — the features requiring Siri to have access to and, effectively, <em>understanding of</em> your personal information, in your apps, stored privately on your devices. These are the most helpful-sounding, most practical, most futuristic features of Apple Intelligence. And they&#39;re the sort of features Apple is almost uniquely positioned to offer, alongside only Google, as the provider of a mobile platform and device ecosystem.</p><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">From Apple&#39;s own announcement</a> , after the WWDC keynote:</p><blockquote><p> Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that&#39;s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, “Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,” and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, “When is Mom&#39;s flight landing?” and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.</p></blockquote><p> “When is Mom&#39;s flight landing?” is easily understood, by we humans, and a really good example of the sort of Siri interaction that would be obviously useful. But you can also pretty easily see how complex it is on Apple&#39;s side. Siri has long been able to do the “Mom” thing. Your spouse, your kids — you&#39;ve long able to tell Siri to call or text those people by nickname like that. But getting your mom&#39;s flight information out of your email (which I think was the premise of this demo in the WWDC keynote — that the flight info was stored in a message in Mail) or from text messages, and then knowing how to check for current flight status information for <em>that</em> flight, is something far beyond the ken of current Siri. Getting the information requires access to your most personal information — your own email and messages. Getting the <em>correct</em> information from your messages requires the common sense of understanding that you&#39;re obviously asking about some sort of <em>current</em> trip your mom is taking, not, say, an email she sent you about a flight back in 2019, or one from 2022, or even one from December last year. The Siri we currently know <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">lacks that sort of common sense</a> . And then lastly, after getting the correct flight from your email, performing this task requires Siri to have the agency to go look up the current status of that particular flight — and get it right <em>every time</em> it provides an answer.</p><p> If Siri answers, “Your mom&#39;s flight is arriving at 4:30 this afternoon, and it&#39;s currently showing an on-time arrival,” you really want that information to be correct if you&#39;ve promised to pick her up at the airport. You&#39;ll be annoyed if you drive to the airport and it turns out she&#39;s not actually landing until 7:30. And you&#39;ll be in <em>real</em> trouble if she&#39;s landing at 1:30 and you show up three hours later, having banked on Siri&#39;s answer being accurate.</p><hr /><p> It&#39;s very unusual, to say the least, for Apple to announce a product delay. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-07">1</a></sup> The white iPhone 4 was supposed to debut alongside the black one in June 2010, but, bizarrely, was delayed several times ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/10/anthropomorphized_white_iphone_4">which I had fun with</a> more than <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-writer-john-gruber-that-white-iphone-i-tweeted-about-was-a-toy-2010-11">once</a> ) and wound up not shipping <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/04/27/jobs-schiller">until the end of April the next year</a> , 10 months late. The original AirPods were announced alongside the iPhones 7 in September 2016, and were supposed to ship in October. They wound up being delayed until December. Apple&#39;s statement in October 2016, regarding the AirPods being delayed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/apple-delays-airpod-rollout-dont-expect-them-in-october/">as given to Matthew Panzarino at TechCrunch</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don&#39;t believe in shipping a product before it&#39;s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.”</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly why Apple hews to an almost religious policy of not announcing products before they&#39;re ready. When they <em>do</em> make exceptions — when they lapse, as it were, as cited above ( <a href="#fn1-2025-03-07">and below</a> ) — they often regret it. You can&#39;t break a promise you never made, and you can&#39;t miss a ship date you never announced. Even with talented teams and realistic managers, there&#39;s often a long span between how long you expect a project to take and how long it actually winds up taking. Engineering schedules often slip even with predictable technologies, and the non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes their future inherently unpredictable.</p><p> Most of Apple Intelligence has felt like Apple has pushed it out a year ahead of the company&#39;s usual level of baked-ness. I&#39;ve held all year long that if the entire industry — along with Wall Street — weren&#39;t in the midst of a generative-AI/LLM mania, that “Apple Intelligence” wouldn&#39;t have been announced until this year&#39;s WWDC, not last year&#39;s. Today&#39;s announcement is disappointing, but to me utterly unsurprising. The Siri integration with personal data through App Intents has never felt like something that was going to be ready for real customer usage in this year&#39;s OS cycle. And if it&#39;s Apple&#39;s general policy not to ship a product before it&#39;s ready, that applies tenfold for a product involving LLM access to deeply private on-device information. It&#39;s better to ship late, but ready, than to ship something unfinished or unreliable to hit a promised deadline. And with something like next-generation Siri, I&#39;d say that&#39;s downright essential. Apple can take the bad publicity today&#39;s announcement is engendering; they cannot afford to squander the trust of their users.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-07"><p> The granddaddy of modern-era Apple product delays, of course, is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/airpower">AirPower</a> — the multi-device (iPhones, Apple Watch, AirPods) charging device that Apple pre-announced in September 2017, alongside the iPhone X and iPhone 8.

<p>Oliver Darcy, reporting at Status (paywalled, alas), <a href="https://www.status.news/p/abc-news-layoffs">on the sudden demise of FiveThirtyEight</a> :</p><blockquote><p> On Wednesday morning, shortly after sending an all-staff memo announcing layoffs at ABC News, network president Almin Karamehmedovic joined a virtual meeting with the FiveThirtyEight team. The 15 staffers at the political analysis site owned by ABC News had learned the previous evening — via a Wall Street Journal report — that they were being let go. Now, they were hearing it from Karamehmedovic himself.</p><p> But Karamehmedovic, like other managers carrying out mass layoffs at ABC News that day, had little to say about it. I&#39;m told he appeared to be reading from a script as he delivered the devastating news. He offered no explanation for why the Disney-owned network had decided to shutter FiveThirtyEight, which it acquired in 2018 along with data whiz and then-editor Nate Silver. He took no questions. He simply thanked the employees for their work, told them a human resources staffer would follow up, and ended the meeting. The entire affair, I&#39;m told, lasted about 15 minutes. Soon after, employees had their access to ABC News&#39; systems shut off and the FiveThirtyEight website was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538">pulled offline</a> . Just like that, it was over.</p></blockquote><p> Business is business, and layoffs and closures are never anything but traumatic. But there&#39;s a right way to do things and a wrong way. And one of the wrong ways is having the staff find out they&#39;re all fired by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-to-cut-nearly-6-staff-across-abc-news-disney-entertainment-networks-8af04b40">reading it from The Wall Street Journal</a> . This guy Karamehmedovic sounds like a real Grade-A dickhead.</p><p> And what is the deal with these companies that just unceremoniously pull the plug on websites when they close them? Why not keep the FiveThirtyEight site up and running — at least for a while, if not in perpetuity? It costs practically nothing to run a server for a static/archived website.我不明白。 It betrays a profound level of disrespect for the work that the site hosted. It&#39;s ABC&#39;s business if they want to close FiveThirtyEight as an ongoing concern, but the years of work deserves to remain online, both out of respect for the people who made it <em>and</em> for the audience that might still want to refer to it. Disney didn&#39;t burn the movies from now-closed subsidiary studios like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchstone_Pictures">Touchstone Pictures</a> .</p><p> There&#39;s a vast gulf between the old world of print and the new world of online publishing. The difference is profound, but largely overlooked, because it&#39;s human nature to just adapt to the nature of different forms of media and quickly accept current media forms as “normal”.通过印刷，对观众来说，问题在很大程度上是短暂的。您每天都会收到一份报纸，每周或一个月都会杂志，并且在阅读它们后会扔掉它们。如果您想回顾一下该报纸每年，一个月甚至几天前都发表了关于某些内容的内容，那么您就不幸了，就可以当场查找。图书馆员从事Yeoman的工作，将报纸和杂志归为缩微胶卷，所以什么都没有消失或遗忘，但是访问缩微胶卷档案是一种巨大的麻烦。您几乎必须知道您想看到的问题的日期，并且必须用页面上的眼球进行“搜索”。今天，任何人都可以立即访问一周，一个月，年甚至数十年的故事的能力是网络出版物的令人叹为观止的优势。在过去的15年左右的时间里，我们有能力从我们所有人的口袋里都携带的小机器来做到这一点。这是真的很棒。</p><p>但是关闭Web出版物时的标准行为就是仅拉插头。当整个公司陷入困境时，那是一回事。但是，当有一家母公司，尤其是一家蓬勃发展的公司时，除了无视这项工作之外，没有其他理由来拉插头。 From the perspective of a company the size of Disney, it would cost veritable pennies to keep FiveThirtyEight&#39;s website around forever.多么耻辱。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ABC关闭FiveThirtyEight，并在其网站上拉插头</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
