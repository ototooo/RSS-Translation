<p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/113940550587737112">昨天在Altstore公告</a>中发布：</p><blockquote><p> iPhone Turn 18今年，这意味着它终于足够老了，可以使用更多的〜成熟〜应用程序…</p><p>介绍了世界上第一个苹果批准的色情应用程序C1D3R的热水浴缸！</p></blockquote><p>默认情况下，屏幕截图和视频预览是模糊的，但是<a href="https://hottubapp.io/">Hot Tub的网站</a>非常清楚地表明，其汇总的内容是严重的色情内容。象征性地说，他们没有他妈的。从字面上看，这正是他们汇总的内容 - 包括应用内“青少年”频道。</p><p>如果我们慷慨大方，则将热水浴缸描述为“苹果批准”，如果我们不是宽容，并且毫无疑问。他们的意思是，热水浴缸​​被苹果（Apple）适当公证 - 表面上是技术性的，而不是社论，其中涵盖了（使用<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">苹果自己的文档中的</a>术语）精度，功能，安全性，安全性和隐私。我在那里说“表面上”是因为苹果在有争议的情况下拒绝公证应用程序出于其他原因，包括在11月<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">拒绝公证的经典MAC MAC MINI VMAC</a> ，这是基于Mini Vmac都违反了Apple的软件许可和滥用Apple Apple的苹果公司的理由商标。</p><p>但是色情几乎一直是Apple在App Store中不需要的内容的规范示例，因此 - 因为Apple的立场是App Store应该是iOS消费者软件的唯一来源 - 他们认为不适合本地应用的内容。自从第一天发货以来，您就可以通过使用网络观看iPhone上的色情片（比App Store提前一年 - 使用网络。 Apple的线一直很清楚：本机应用程序= Apple批准；网络=任何事情发生。 （同一行也用于数字商品和服务的付款处理。）</p><p>早在2010年，MG Siegler（当时在TechCrunch）就史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）和客户Matthew Browing之间进行了电子邮件交流。布罗夫写给乔布斯：</p><blockquote><p>看来越来越多的苹果为消费者确定了他们应该能够收到的内容。例如，马克·菲奥尔（Mark Fiore）的漫画应用程序（由于是政治讽刺）的阻塞或阻止苹果认为是色情的东西。</p><p>我全都是为了让色情范围内的孩子。哎呀 - 我全都是为了确保我不必看到它，除非我愿意。但是……这就是父母控制的目的。将这些类型的应用程序归类为类别，并允许他们在他们愿意的情况下被父母阻止。</p><p>苹果的角色不是道德警察 - 苹果的角色是设计和生产真正酷的小工具，以实现消费者希望他们做的事情。</p></blockquote><p>工作回应：</p><blockquote><p> Fiore的应用程序很快就会在商店里。那是一个错误。但是，我们确实相信我们有道德责任使色情范围远离iPhone。想要色情的人们可以购买Android手机。</p></blockquote><p> （这个人知道如何写电子邮件。）</p><p>快进到现在，苹果一直认为色情是从一开始就坚决反对欧盟DMA的原因之一。去年，DMA生效后， <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">FastCompany的Michael Grothaus采访了App Store的负责人Phil Schiller</a> ：</p><blockquote><p>席勒很快指出，尽管采取了这些新的安全措施，但苹果可以为允许替代应用市场市场运行的用户提供的保护范围限制。该公司几乎无法控制这些市场的应用程序内容，即使该内容令人反感或有害。</p><p>席勒说：“最终，我们在应用商店中不允许有些事情 - 我们认为这是安全或不合适的事情。” “这些其他市场是否具有相同的条款和限制，这不是我们的决定。”</p><p>因此，是的，第一次可以在iPhone上运行专门用于色情的应用程序。这应该是父母知道的，因为DMA并没有赋予Apple禁止某些类型的应用程序商店在其平台上运营的合法权利，Apple也没有能力阻止孩子将这种应用程序商店下载到他们的平台上iPhone。</p></blockquote><p>最后，关于热水浴缸和Altstore，苹果昨天向包括大胆的火球在内的媒体发表了这一说法：</p><blockquote><p>我们深切关注此类类型的核心色情应用程序为欧盟用户（尤其是孩子）创造的安全风险。这个应用程序和其他类似的应用程序将破坏消费者对我们生态系统的信任和信心，我们已经工作了十多年，以使世界上最好。与市场开发人员的虚假陈述相反，我们当然不赞成此应用程序，并且永远不会在我们的应用商店中提供。事实是，欧盟委员会要求我们允许这样的市场运营商等市场运营商和Epic等市场运营商分配我们对用户安全的关注。</p></blockquote><p>因此，不，Apple尤其没有批准热水浴缸，也不能够分发本地色情应用程序的能力。每个与AltStore和热水浴缸有关的人都知道这一点，但是他们也知道以这种方式进行框架 - 宣布<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/introducing-hot-tub-banner.png">这张横幅图形</a>促进热水浴缸作为“第一个苹果批准的色情应用程序”  - 是<a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250203/p16#a250203p16">成为头条新闻</a>的好方法。 （The Verge：“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604937/iphone-ios-porn-app-hot-tub-altstore-pal-eu">第一个&#39;批准的&#39;iPhone色情应用程序正在欧洲</a>”  - 除了轻微的点击<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/02/schadenfreude">诱饵</a>倾斜之外，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">误导性地将“欧洲”与“欧盟”混为一谈</a>。<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">公证被用作传达主题批准的工具</a>。</p><p>如果我们想对动词进行挑剔的动词，我认为Apple<em>接受</em>应用程序（例如Hot Tub）进行公证，而不是<em>批准</em>。征求<em>接受</em>不仅仅是获得<em>批准</em>。</p><p>但是，正如苹果本身在其声明中强调的那样，DMA要求他们允许它。我看不到<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/home/en">欧盟委员会官员</a>庆祝热水浴缸的庆祝推<a href="https://x.com/teresaribera">文</a>或公告。只是板球chi。当涉及本地iOS色情应用程序时，欧盟现在不仅比美国，而且在世界其他地方都具有明确的优势。您可能认为他们想庆祝这一成就。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★“热水浴缸”，一个用于iOS的铁杆色情应用</title></entry><entry><title>抖动</title><link href="https://dithering.fm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w23" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/dithering" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41547</id><published> 2025-02-04T18：09：14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T18：09：15Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>埃兹拉·克莱因（Ezra Klein）在《纽约时报》的音频论文/抄录专栏中：</p><blockquote><p>这就是特朗普整个战略的核心：特朗普的行为像国王，因为他太虚弱，无法像总统一样统治。他正试图将感知代替现实。他希望感知成为现实。只有当我们相信他时，这种情况才会发生。 [...]</p><p>特朗普希望您在所有这项活动中看到的是命令。在所有这些活动中，真正的是混乱。他们没有一些秘密的焦点库，而我们其余的人则没有。他们已经说服自己，速度和力量本身就是一种策略 - 从某种意义上说，它是替代实际策略的策略。不相信他们。</p></blockquote><p>摧毁事物是简单快捷的，通常是瞬时的。建立新事物是艰苦而缓慢的工作，而且通常更艰苦，更慢以改善现有事物。</p><blockquote><p>几个月前，我与知道联邦政府如何工作以及任何活着的人进行对话。我问他，如果他看到特朗普这样做，他最让他担心。他告诉我的是，如果特朗普慢慢走，他最担心。如果他通过做使他更受欢迎并使反对派变得更虚弱和困惑的事情开始任期。如果他试图为中期增强力量，同时慢慢扩大自己的力量并在最弱的深处占领。</p></blockquote><p>这是乐观的看法 - 特朗普和他的新政府试图漫步（或者是疯狂的？）猛击首轮淘汰赛。他们完全没有准备15轮艰苦的口号。悲观的看法是，第一轮淘汰赛可能发生。</p><p>美国的最终权力不是我们的政治或法律制度。这是我们的文化。我们的集体态度。我们总体上显然是在历史上非常糟糕的，因为我们总体上清楚地忘记了<em>四年</em>后特朗普总统的混乱是多么混乱，而我们忘记了我们不喜欢混乱的领导才能。但是<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">我们知道我们不喜欢什么</a>，我们对此我们发声。他没有做任何事情来增加他的流行幅度，并且已经在做很多事情来丢失它。<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/donald-trump-favorability">在他的第一任期内，他从来都不是很受欢迎</a>- 不在一开始，不是在中间，绝对不是最后。<a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_m8tctwx.pdf">目前</a>是他有史以来最受欢迎的，净认可约为零。那是特朗普的高水位 -<em>刚刚很</em>受欢迎以赢得选举。</p><div> <a  title="与“不相信他”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/dont-believe-him">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Cabel Sasser：“ 2024年的小吃和谷物” </title><link href="https://cabel.com/2025/01/27/the-snacks-cereals-of-2024/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/02/cabel-snacks-cereal" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41541</id><published> 2025-02-02T23：16：40Z</published><updated> 2025-02-02T23：16：40Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

The dinner was one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the relationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump&#39;s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump warned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the election against him.</p><p> Toward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of the lawsuit, the people said.

<p>Via David Smith on Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113923389557198608">who writes</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The recent work I&#39;ve been doing has required a lot of sharing files between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the ideal tool for this but I&#39;ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p><p> Instead I&#39;ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop alternative and it&#39;s been working fantastically. The only real downside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the share to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that&#39;s a tradeoff I&#39;ll happily make.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow I&#39;d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It&#39;s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229">in the App Store</a> and <a href="https://localsend.org/download">via the web</a> . No middleman in the cloud — transfers are peer-to-peer, and the whole project is <a href="https://localsend.org/community">open source with an active community on GitHub</a> .</p><p> When I dick around with my Android burner phone, I often find myself sorely missing AirDrop and Continuity. Sometimes I just want to move the contents of my clipboard from one device to the other — LocalSend makes that easier than anything else I&#39;ve seen.</p><p> I&#39;m not even sure Smith&#39;s “downside” is really a downside. I understand why AirDrop works the way it does (always-on in the background), but I wouldn&#39;t want LocalSend to work that way. I <em>like</em> the explicitness of opening it on both devices.</p><p> Just an outstanding project from developer Tien Do Nam.

<p>A Monday report from Reuters, syndicated at The Guardian, “Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, Trump Claims”:</p><blockquote><p> Donald Trump has suggested that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok and that he would like to see a bidding war over the app. When asked if Microsoft was in talks to buy the app, the US president said “I would say yes”, adding “A lot of interest in TikTok. There&#39;s great interest in TikTok.”</p><p> Microsoft, TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters&#39; requests for a comment outside regular business hours, after the US president&#39;s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday.</p><p> The reported talks mark the second time that Microsoft has been in the frame to acquire TikTok. During his first term, Trump ordered TikTok to separate its US version from ByteDance citing national security concerns. Microsoft emerged as a top bidder in 2020, but the talks soon collapsed, and Trump&#39;s divestment push ended a few months later when he left office.</p></blockquote><p> Is it really true that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok from ByteDance? Or did Donald Trump just bullshit his “I would say yes”? This report, based on nothing more than an off-the-cuff verbal answer from Trump Monday, has had absolutely zero follow-up since. Microsoft reported its quarterly earnings yesterday and there was not a word about a TikTok acquisition. And in the years since 2020, Microsoft has invested a staggering amount of capital into data centers for AI and cloud computing — their $22 billion spend last quarter and estimated $80 billion spend for the upcoming year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/microsoft-earnings-stock.html">dominated news coverage</a> and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">analysis</a> of their results yesterday. They also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">acquired Activision Blizzard</a> for about $70 billion. I&#39;m not saying Microsoft couldn&#39;t afford to acquire TikTok — they could, I&#39;m sure — but it&#39;d raise a genuine question about focus. But there&#39;s <em>nothing</em> <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">in the coverage of yesterday&#39;s results</a> or the analyst call they held that suggests they&#39;re in the hunt for TikTok.</p><p> Whether you love Trump or hate him (or, bizarrely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">somehow fall in-between</a> — please see me after class if you&#39;re of that mind) we all know he&#39;s a bullshitter. He makes shit up. Either (a) there are secret talks between Microsoft and ByteDance, and Trump is privy to those talks, and he decided to blab about them, but only when asked; or (b) he just said “I would say yes” when asked because he thought it would sound good and reinforce his self image as the world&#39;s most juiced-in dealmaker. I know which seems more likely.</p><p> And even if it&#39;s <em>not</em> bullshit, if all a news report has to go on is Donald Trump saying “I would say yes”, that <em>has</em> to be filed under “Maybe this is true” <em>at best</em> . So the headline, at its most generous, should put that first: “Trump Claims Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok”, not “Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, Trump Claims”.</p><p> Here&#39;s the kicker: Reuters&#39;s original headline, on reuters.com, actually got this right: “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-microsoft-is-talks-acquire-tiktok-2025-01-28/">Trump Says Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok</a> ”.

<p>Fascinating thread — and an almost entirely civil discussion of what has become, for obvious reasons, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">an inflammatory topic</a> . These are mapping and metadata nerds approaching the dilemma in the very nerdiest of ways. I found it rather soothing, and also quite informative — particularly the posts from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Minh%20Nguyen">Minh Nguyễn</a> , who seems to be an OpenStreetMap super user.<a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/55">第一的</a>：</p><blockquote><p> So it turns out the UNGEGN is not actually a decision-making authority on individual toponyms. Their role is to encourage and facilitate standardization. They literally issue <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/wgGuidelines.html">guidelines about guidelines</a> . The closest thing to an authority on the gulf&#39;s name <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265039137_The_Naming_of_Maritime_Features_Viewed_from_an_International_Law_Perspective">in international law</a> would be the International Hydrographic Organization. The IHO&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_Oceans_and_Seas"><em>Limits of Oceans and Seas</em></a> has been frozen in time without any updates since 1953, apparently because Japan and South Korea can&#39;t agree on a name for the sea separating them. Maybe a certain dealmaker can get them to the bargaining table…</p></blockquote><p> My kneejerk reaction to Trump&#39;s “Gulf of America” executive order was that mapmakers should just roll their eyes, make the jerk-off motion, and ignore it. But that&#39;s not practical. Mapmakers seek to appeal to authority on names. What&#39;s the alternative? That Google and Apple (and OpenStreetMaps) serve as their own authorities on the names of topographical features and geographical points of interest? That&#39;s not right. So you might think, well, the Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water, so the mapmakers should appeal to an international authority. The UN! But as Nguyễn cites, that&#39;s not what the UN&#39;s Group of Experts on Geographical Names does.</p><p> <a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/87">Another post in the thread from Nguyễn</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Ironically, Spanish-language media <a href="https://elpais.com/us/2025-01-21/de-golfo-de-mexico-a-golfo-de-america-trump-renombra-el-mapa-aunque-con-improbables-consecuencias-internacionales.html/">keeps having to explain</a> why <em>Gulf of America</em> is problematic in English. In Spanish, <em>América</em> refers to the Americas as a whole, not the US specifically. If one didn&#39;t know any better, one would think it&#39;s a gift to Cuba! Of course, this doesn&#39;t justify the attempt to rename the gulf, since the intention is abundantly clear, but it does leave the name vulnerable to others reclaiming it for themselves. A more erudite politician might&#39;ve chosen <em>Gulf of Florida</em> , which at least has a historical basis, dating to around the same time as <em>Gulf of Mexico</em> . But here we are.</p></blockquote><p> And from yet another post by Nguyễn, a link to <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12881">this new report on the order&#39;s implications for the entire federal government</a> from the Congressional Research Service (a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress). Now we&#39;ve gotten more good nerds involved: librarians. And whatever the answer is, it&#39;s complicated.</p><p> I don&#39;t like this ostensible renaming (rebranding?) of the Gulf of Mexico any more than you do. It&#39;s petty and pointless, except for the trolling spite, which, of course, <em>is</em> the point. I don&#39;t know what Apple is going to do, but I suspect, ultimately, if the Department of the Interior really does make this official, Apple Maps will follow suit, but perhaps with something like “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” for users in the US.</p><p> Google should have simply done what Apple is doing, though, and remained utterly silent on the issue until and if it&#39;s actually made official.

He <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging">sold his most recent startup</a> , a messaging app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998294/beeper-imessage-apple-app-security">called Beeper</a> , to Automattic last year and left the company in the fall. Since then, he&#39;d thought about starting a Pebble-like product from scratch, figuring it&#39;d be easier to do the same thing again a second time. “But then I was like, <em>what if I just asked Google to open-source the operating system</em> ?”他说。 It felt like a long shot, but he knew the code was just sitting dormant inside Mountain View somewhere. So he asked. A few times.</p><p> To Migicovsky&#39;s surprise, Google agreed to release Pebble OS to the public. As of Monday, <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html">all the Pebble firmware is available on GitHub</a> , and Migicovsky is starting a company to pick up where he left off.</p><p> The company — which can&#39;t be named Pebble because Google still owns that — doesn&#39;t have a name yet.</p></blockquote><p> My first idea for a new name: Rebble — a rebellious return of Pebble. My second idea: Quixote — because this isn&#39;t going to be a hit this time either. (Quixote also would have been a good name for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her">Beeper Mini&#39;s attempt to backwards engineer</a> access <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_mini_is_back">as an unsanctioned iMessage client for Android</a> .) But, thankfully, it doesn&#39;t sound to me like Migicovsky&#39;s goal is to boil the ocean. ( <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out, <a href="https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html">Rebble is the name of a community project</a> to write new firmware to keep old Pebble watches running.)</p><p> <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back">Migicovsky, on his blog</a> :</p><blockquote><p> You&#39;d <em>imagine</em> that smartwatches have evolved considerably since 2012. I&#39;ve tried every single smart watch out there, but none do it for me. No one makes a smartwatch with the core set of features I want:</p><ul><li> <em>Always-on e-paper screen</em> (it&#39;s reflective rather than emissive. Sunlight readable. Glanceable. Not distracting to others like a bright wrist)</li><li> <em>Long battery life</em> (one less thing to charge. It&#39;s annoying to need extra cables when traveling)</li><li> <em>Simple and beautiful user experience</em> around a core set of features I use regularly (telling time, notifications, music control, alarms, weather, calendar, sleep/step tracking)</li><li> <em>Buttons!</em> (to play/pause/skip music on my phone without looking at the screen)</li><li> <em>Hackable</em> (apparently you can&#39;t even write your own watchfaces for Apple Watch? That is wild. There were >;16k watchfaces on the Pebble appstore!)</li></ul></blockquote><p> If their goal is to be to smartwatches what <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> is to handheld gaming, that&#39;s definitely achievable, and if they succeed, will by definition be a lot of fun.</p><p> The whole tech world needs more projects that aren&#39;t trying to become billion- (let alone trillion‑) dollar ideas, but are happily shooting for success as million-dollar ideas (or less!). Many of the best and most beloved movies ever made weren&#39;t big-budget Hollywood blockbusters. If your list of all-time favorite movies doesn&#39;t include a bunch that were made on shoestring budgets, your whole list probably sucks, because you have no taste. The same is of course true for music, games, and everything else. Indie art is often <em>great</em> art, imbued by the souls and obsessions of its creators, and blockbuster art is often garbage art, imbued only by soulless corporate bureaucracies.</p><p> Computer hardware and software can be — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/11/make-something-wonderful">ought to be</a> — attempts at creating art.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Pebble Founder Eric Migicovsky Is Bringing It Back </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/my_spitball_theory_on_tiktoks_current_semi-reprieve_in_the_us" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1j" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41527</id><published> 2025-01-29T02:13:53Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T14:48:40Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user&#39;s phone continues to function, that user can&#39;t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance&#39;s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#39;s an addendum to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">my post yesterday</a> on the recent shake-up atop the generally stable “top free downloads” list in the App Store. Some of the shake-up is from new entrants, like the much-ballyhooed AI chatbot DeepSeek. But a lot of it is the direct result of the sudden absence of ByteDance&#39;s entire lineup of apps: TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap. Alternatives are vying to fill those voids. [ <strong>Update, one day later:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/marvel-snap-returns-to-app-store/">Marvel Snap is back in the App Store</a> , because it now has a new publisher.]</p><p> TikTok returning to operational service in the US <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">after an outage of just one day</a> has squelched the outrage surrounding its ban. The app stopped working; TikTok users, unprepared for its ban, freaked out; the app started working again the next day; and TikTok fans more or less went back to scrolling their feeds and shut up. Controversy over.</p><p> But the controversy shouldn&#39;t be over. And unless something changes, it&#39;s going to slowly simmer back to an eventual boil.</p><p> Nobody is really talking about the fact that ByteDance apps remain banned, legally speaking, in the US right now, and already-installed copies of their apps are only continuing to function because TikTok&#39;s US cloud providers, Oracle and Akamai, restored service on the word of President Trump that they won&#39;t be held accountable for doing so, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">despite being in clear violation of the PAFACA Act</a> . But neither Apple nor Google has restored any of ByteDance&#39;s apps to the App Store or Play Store. That hasn&#39;t interfered with TikTok going back to operational via copies of the app already installed on users&#39; phones, but it&#39;s an insurmountable — although incremental — problem in the long run.</p><p> The conventional wisdom is that Oracle and Akamai are being a bit reckless (“ <em>If Trump says we&#39;re good, we&#39;re good — what could go wrong, it&#39;s not like Trump has ever changed his mind...</em> ”) and Apple and Google are prudent, more staid (“ <em>We&#39;re following the letter of the law and will continue to follow the letter of the law</em> ”). And perhaps that&#39;s all there is to this. But now that we&#39;re over a week into this post-ban period, I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s purely a coincidence that these four companies split along these lines. The two cloud providers required for TikTok to function on one side, the two app store providers on the other.</p><p> With TikTok&#39;s cloud provider access shut off, it was like a guillotine. TikTok was working for everyone in the US, then boom, it was shut down for everyone. Then, just as suddenly, it was back.</p><p> Being locked out of the App Store and Play Store, on the other hand, is a slow squeeze. The first thing that comes to mind, obviously, is no new users. No growth. TikTok already has a mind-boggling number of users in the US (estimates seem to range from 120 to 170 million), but no growth is no growth.</p><p> The second thing that comes to mind is no app updates for US users. No new features. No bug fixes. No security patches. TikTok, like most popular apps, typically pushes updates to the App Store and Play Store every two or three weeks. What happens now that that&#39;s stopped for US users? Is ByteDance still going to push app updates to users in the rest of the world? TikTok obviously has a lot of American users but <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/data-drop-5-charts-on-tiktoks-growth-asia-pacific"><em>most</em> of its users live elsewhere</a> .</p><p> But the third factor is the most insidious: even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user&#39;s phone continues to function, that user can&#39;t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance&#39;s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores. Wipe and restore your phone from backup? No more TikTok. Buy a new phone? No TikTok on the new phone.</p><p> Trump&#39;s reprieve was a declaration that the Justice Department wouldn&#39;t enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance doesn&#39;t sell TikTok — and it sure doesn&#39;t seem like they have any more intention to sell it now than they did before the ban took effect — what happens? <em>Another</em> (even more shambolically illegal) Trump extension that only keeps TikTok functioning, but not available in the app stores? Because the other side isn&#39;t budging either: China hawks like Senator Tom Cotton <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/speeches/icymi-cotton-objects-to-tiktok-ban-extension">have not shifted an inch</a> . They&#39;re tolerating Trump&#39;s 75-day reprieve but not budging from their overall “sell or you&#39;re banned” stance.</p><p> I&#39;m not saying this is a backroom plot between the administration and these companies, but I&#39;m not saying it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a backroom agreement either. Trump isn&#39;t complaining about Apple and Google not getting on board. And neither Apple nor Google seems worried about Trump&#39;s wrath for not following Oracle and Akamai&#39;s leads. The goal of the legislation isn&#39;t to pull the plug on TikTok for Americans — it&#39;s to pressure ByteDance (and really, their bosses in the Chinese Communist Party) into selling the app. Instantly banning TikTok&#39;s US operations resulted in instant and vociferous outrage from TikTok users — the pressure turned out not to be on ByteDance and the CCP, it was on the US government to give people back their beloved TikTok. So I think everyone on the US side is looking at the current detente — TikTok being available to existing users through existing copies of the app, but not being available in app stores — as a way to turn the pressure up only on ByteDance. Slowly strangle TikTok over a period of months, rather than behead it overnight.</p><p> But what happens if the CCP stands pat? If they just wait it out? If ByteDance were a normal company they&#39;d face financial pressure to capitulate and sell. But the CCP isn&#39;t under any financial pressure to allow ByteDance to sell. Say what you will about the Chinese government, but they do not lack for patience. What happens then, when word starts spreading amongst TikTok fans not to upgrade their phones, lest they lose access to the app? Apple&#39;s going to have some strong feelings about that.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ My Spitball Theory on TikTok&#39;s Current Semi-Reprieve in the US</title></entry><entry><title> Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to &#39;Gulf of America&#39;, for American Users Only </title><link href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41526</id><published> 2025-01-29T01:00:22Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T22:12:57Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Google, in an announcement on X:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.</p><p> For geographic features in the US, this is when <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) is updated. When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the US quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.</p><p> Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-reclassifies-us-as-sensitive-country-like-china-russia-.html">Jennifer Elias, reporting for CNBC</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google&#39;s maps division on Monday reclassified the US as a “sensitive country,” a designation it reserves for states with strict governments and border disputes, CNBC has learned. [...]</p><p> Some team members within the maps division were ordered to urgently make changes to the location name and recategorize the US from “non-sensitive” to “sensitive,” according to the internal correspondence. The changes were given a rare “P0” order, meaning it had the highest priority level and employees were immediately notified and instructed to drop what they were doing to work on it.</p><p> Google&#39;s order states that the Gulf of America title change should be treated similar to the Persian Gulf, which in Arab countries is displayed on Google Maps as Arabian Gulf.</p></blockquote><p> No word from Apple on how Apple Maps will handle this. (I&#39;ve asked for comment; will update if I get an answer.) Re-renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley seems like a no-brainer for the maps to comply with. A country names its own mountains. If Obama could rename it, Trump can re-rename it.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico, though, is an international body of water, and its name wasn&#39;t even debated until Trump started talking about it a few weeks ago. Google (and perhaps Apple) having a policy where they simply follow the naming conventions of the GNIS seems not merely sensible but utterly uncontroversial ... until now.</p><p> There are three countries in the world that don&#39;t use the metric system as their official units of measure: the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar.

<p>Sarah Perez, TechCrunch “ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/automattic-and-others-back-openvibe-an-app-thats-unifying-the-open-social-web/">Automattic and Others Back Openvibe, an App That&#39;s Unifying the Open Social Web</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/openvibe-combines-mastodon-bluesky-and-nostr-into-one-social-app/">Launched in 2024</a> , Openvibe initially supported three of the more prominent open social networks, all of which operate using different protocols: Mastodon uses ActivityPub, Bluesky runs on AT Protocol, and Nostr powers a number of third-party apps. Openvibe later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/cross-posting-social-app-openvibe-now-supports-threads-too/">added support for Instagram Threads</a> , as that app became further integrated with ActivityPub and opened itself up to the developer community.</p><p> As CEO Matej Svancer explained at the time, the idea behind his app was to offer users a more friendly and “easy-to-use gateway” to the open social web. Because of the different protocols these networks utilize, it can be difficult for newcomers who end up having to switch apps or limit their engagement to just their preferred platform.</p><p> But Openvibe doesn&#39;t just let people stay connected with friends across all these services in a combined timeline, it also allows cross-posting to multiple networks at once.</p></blockquote><p> I just gave it a try, and my take is that <a href="https://openvibe.social/">Openvibe</a> is definitely interesting, but it&#39;s not for me, and I&#39;m not really sure who it <em>is</em> for. I signed into all three of my personal accounts that Openvibe supposedly supports: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo">Bluesky</a> , <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">Mastodon</a> , and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber">Threads</a> . I got a home timeline that mashes together all the posts from my Bluesky and Mastodon accounts. I don&#39;t see any errors related to Threads, but I don&#39;t see any posts from Threads. That kind of makes sense because Threads doesn&#39;t offer an API that allows for full third-party clients. Threads does have an API for posting, so I presume my Threads account in Openvibe is write-only. Openvibe&#39;s website and the app itself make it seem like I should see content from my Threads timeline, though. (Perhaps I don&#39;t because <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113635727167100815">I turned off “fediverse sharing”</a> with my Threads account a few weeks ago — <em>because</em> I prefer keeping these networks separate. But if that&#39;s the problem, Openvibe doesn&#39;t explain that I need to re-enable it ）</p><p> I really don&#39;t see the point of mashing the tweets from two (or more!) different social networks into one unified timeline. To me it&#39;s just confusing. I don&#39;t love the current situation where three entirely separate, thriving social networks each merit some portion of my attention (not to mention that a fourth, X, still kinda does too). But when I use each of these platforms, I want to use a client that is dedicated to each platform. These platforms all have different features, to varying degrees, and they definitely have different vibes and cultural norms. Pretending that they all form one big (lowercase-m) meta platform doesn&#39;t make that pretense cohesive. Mashing them all together in one timeline isn&#39;t simpler. It <em>sounds</em> simpler but in practice it&#39;s more cacophonous.</p><p> The idea that this might in any way appeal to “newcomers” is bananas to me. The concept of streaming multiple accounts from multiple networks into one timeline is by definition a bit advanced. In my experience, for very obvious reasons, casual social network users only use the first-party client. They&#39;re confused even by the idea of using, say, an app named <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> to access a social network called Mastodon. The idea of explaining to them why they might want to use an app named Openvibe to access Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads (and the weirdo blockchain network Nostr) is like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dwread/32464548110">trying to explain to your dog why they should stay out of the trash</a> . There&#39;s a market for third-party clients (or at least I hope there is), but that market is not made up of “newcomers”.</p><p> Also, Openvibe is not a good app. It doesn&#39;t look great, the custom font is somewhat cartoon-y (which I find both unattractive and off-putting), there&#39;s a lot of gray-on-white low-contrast iconography and text, and, worst of all, it seems to update your feeds periodically and when it does, it refreshes and scrolls the timeline <em>while you&#39;re looking at it</em> . It&#39;s like having a book turn the page automatically while you&#39;re reading in the middle of a page. When you leave and come back to the app a few minutes later, the timeline needs to reload, which contributes to the app feeling pretty slow. The overall look, feel, and layout says “generic Twitter-style social network”.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/openvibe-screenshot.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

  /></a></p><p> I do use and very much see the point of <a href="https://croissantapp.com/">Croissant</a> , a multi-network app for <em>cross-posting</em> to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky. Croissant isn&#39;t a client for consuming content from those platforms; it&#39;s just a tool for sending new posts <em>to</em> those platforms.</p><p> And I&#39;d love it if Tapbots&#39;s aforementioned Ivory added support for Bluesky accounts. But when I use Ivory (as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">when I used Tweetbot</a> , for years, before it), I don&#39;t see — and wouldn&#39;t want to see — a single timeline from all configured accounts. I want to switch between multiple accounts, each with their own discrete timelines. Openvibe is in many ways the opposite of Ivory, starting right from its slogan: “All decentralised social networks, single timeline”.</p><p> <strong>Addendum, 30 January 2025:</strong> I never got far enough with Openvibe to grant it permission to send me notifications, <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@0xC0FFEE/113919087229728133">but Kim Slawson did</a> , and Openvibe&#39;s notifications are borderline useless. Rather than tell you anything useful about the posts you&#39;re being notified about — you know, like what they say, or who posted them — they all just say “🔔 New notification is waiting for you!” So useless it&#39;s amazing.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Openvibe, a Multi-Social-Network App for Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads (Supposedly), and Nostr</title></entry><entry><title> iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Are Both Out </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-now-available-new-features/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-macos-15-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41523</id><published> 2025-01-28T19:26:02Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T00:26:11Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Good luck Jim!</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@aaron.rupar/post/DFIpGsKgXdb">Here&#39;s a recent example of Acosta&#39;s exemplary work on CNN</a> , interviewing Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee:</p><blockquote><p> ACOSTA: Do you agree with Trump&#39;s decision to pardon violent people?</p><p>代表。 BURCHETT: If they were truly violent, no. But I don&#39;t know that?</p><p> ACOSTA: What do you mean you don&#39;t know? We&#39;re showing the footage right now.</p></blockquote><p> Oliver Darcy, the former CNN media reporter now working under his own umbrella at Status, has been all over the abject cowardice of CNN&#39;s current chief executive, Mark Thompson:</p><blockquote><p> The anchor, I&#39;m told, signaled to associates in private conversations over the weekend that he intends to depart the network after its chief executive, Mark Thompson, booted him from the morning programming lineup — a move that conspicuously coincided with Donald Trump&#39;s return to力量。</p><p> CNN brass, <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jim-acosta-cnn-mark-thompson-midnight-offer">as we first reported earlier this month</a> , decided to strip Acosta of his 10am show, which he has anchored to great ratings success over the last 11 months, at times even seeing higher viewership than programs in the channel&#39;s prime time bloc.</p><p> Acosta was instead offered the less-than-desirable option of anchoring a show from midnight until 2am ET.</p><p> CNN pitched the gig to Acosta as anchoring during prime time on the West Coast and said he could move to Los Angeles to host the program. But the reality is the program would have aired at a time in which cable news viewership is at its lowest levels.</p></blockquote><p> Acosta&#39;s morning ratings were high, not low. There&#39;s no explanation for CNN forcing him to midnight other than appeasement of a president who spends his days obsessing over cable news.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jim Acosta, Reporter and Anchor Despised by Trump, Was Pushed Out of CNN’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/acosta-out-at-cnn">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1d" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/01/protect_your_app_with_workos_r_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41521</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-01-28T02:19:56Z</published><updated> 2025-01-28T02:19:56Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass:</p><blockquote><p> Anyway, this matters because it doesn&#39;t mean that DeepSeek, an app based off of the Chinese-developed AI model of the same name, is the most popular app ever despite its current place atop the charts. Your mom probably isn&#39;t downloading it. Just as last week, your mom probably wasn&#39;t <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-042-tiktok-twitter/#:~:text=%2D%2D%20Candacce%2C,in%20social%20media.">downloading Xiaohongshu</a> (&#39; <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-043-bromo-sapiens/#:~:text=%F0%9F%95%9A%20TikTok%20Prepares,%3F%20%5BInformation%20%F0%9F%94%92%5D">Little Red Book</a> &#39;), incidentally another Chinese app that rose to the top of the charts. But it is still interesting because again, the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure, new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right now, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from Google (Google) in the top 10.</p><p> Instead, we have the aforementioned DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Paramount+, Temu, Fox Sports, Bluesky, ReelShort, and VPN rounding out the top 10. It&#39;s pretty easy to see why each of these has risen: interest in AI, interest in sports around the NFL playoffs, interest in Twitter-like social networks given <a href="https://spyglass.org/a-time-to-kill-twitter/">the Xitter situation</a> , and yes, <a href="https://spyglass.org/twittertok/">the TikTok ban</a> .</p></blockquote><p> The specific reasons are varied, but altogether it really is true that, for the moment at least, there&#39;s a serious shakeup atop the App Store top free downloads list. That&#39;s interesting for several reasons.</p><p> DeepSeek is at #1 and ChatGPT #2. That&#39;s great for “AI” but a bad look for OpenAI at the moment. I can&#39;t help but think that DeepSeek having rocketed to the top spot, seemingly ( <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1226">but not actually</a> ) out of nowhere helped drive today&#39;s stock market reaction. (Google Gemini is down at #14.)</p><p> Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple&#39;s strength in AI. Sure, Apple&#39;s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">pretty embarrassing</a> right now, even <em>with</em> its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson&#39;s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/wwdc-apple-intelligence-apple-aggregates-ai/">reinforces Apple&#39;s role as an aggregator of AI</a> . The measuring stick for consumer AI products <em>and</em> public social media networks is where they&#39;re listed on the App Store. Not app stores, lowercase. <em>The</em> App Store. Apple&#39;s. That&#39;s The Show, the Major Leagues. So sure, it&#39;d be better for Apple users and Apple shareholders, and thus better for Apple itself, if Apple&#39;s own AI was at least sort of kind of competitive, rather than the butt of jokes. Aside from the easily forgotten iTunes Ping 15 years ago, Apple hasn&#39;t even <em>tried</em> to offer its own public broadcast-style social media platform. But the iPhone is <em>the</em> place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn&#39;t matter if Comcast&#39;s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut.</p><p> Lastly, when it comes to Meta: Threads is #3 (the people arguing that Threads is a bust sure are quiet lately), Instagram is down to #16 (not great if they were hoping for a bounce from TikTok&#39;s questionable future), WhatsApp #17 (not bad on iOS in the US, where iMessage is strongest) and Facebook is ... scroll, scroll, scroll ... #32, just behind Walmart and Microsoft Teams. 32 isn&#39;t that far ahead of X, which clocks in at #41. Facebook might never die, but we seem to be watching it fade away.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Shakeup in the App Store Top Downloads List’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CNBC: &#39;Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China&#39;s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off&#39; </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-chinas-deepseek-triggers-global-tech-sell-off.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41519</id><published> 2025-01-27T22:15:20Z</published><updated> 2025-01-28T16:51:36Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jenni Reid and Alex Harring, reporting for CNBC:</p><blockquote><p> Nvidia and other US technology firms plunged on Monday, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America&#39;s leadership in the sector.</p><p> Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, last slid 17.3%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020.</p></blockquote><p> To make a long story short, it&#39;s been broadly assumed that leading-edge model training <em>and</em> inference requires the highest of high-end hardware — which hardware, especially for training, pretty much exclusively comes from Nvidia. The assumption was that any company trying to compete in this fiercely competitive field — a field with massive implications for industry, culture, and national security — must get in line to buy (or rent) enormous amounts of computational power exclusively available on the very best systems from Nvidia. That hardware isn&#39;t available (at least legally) to Chinese companies, because of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/u-s-targets-china-with-new-ai-curbs-overriding-nvidias-objections-d1e06807">the Biden administration&#39;s export bans</a> . DeepSeek engineers found and implemented multiple massive efficiency improvements that allowed the company to train its latest models at far lower prices using far-less-capable hardware, and perform <a href="https://www.vectara.com/glossary-of-llm-terms#llm-inference">inference</a> under heretofore unprecedented memory constraints. DeepSeek&#39;s achievements render obsolete several prior planks of conventional wisdom regarding the state of AI. My link a few sentences prior in this paragraph is to a WSJ report from 14 days ago that now feels like it dates from at least 14 <em>months</em> ago.</p><p> The most shocking result has been a 17 percent hit to Nvidia&#39;s stock price today, knocking somewhere around $350 <em>billion</em> off their market cap. Google is down about 4 percent, and Microsoft down 2 percent — but Meta is up 1 percent and Apple is up a little over 3 percent. I think the market is reacting pretty sensibly:</p><ul><li><p> Nvidia has taken an unprecedented beating. $350 billion is more than the combined market caps of Verizon <em>and</em> AT&amp;T (each worth roughly $170 billion). But Nvidia has been — and even with these breakthroughs from DeepSeek, remains — in an unprecedented position. Nvidia&#39;s high-flying valuation reflects its unprecedented position as <em>the</em> essential hardware company for AI. Nvidia&#39;s position, post-R1, remains essential — just not <em>as</em> essential as everyone thought. Hence the haircut. But Nvidia <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">remains</a> the third-most-valuable company in the world — it took a massive plunge today but in no way collapsed.</p></li><li><p> TSMC and Broadcom both took big hits today too (-13% and -17%, respectively). Being a “chip company” doesn&#39;t look as sweet today as it did last week.</p></li><li><p> If OpenAI were publicly traded, I suspect it might have collapsed — the sell-off it would have faced today might have triggered emergency measures that halted trading.</p></li><li><p> Microsoft has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/">distancing itself from OpenAI</a> , but is still intertwined with them like no other company. (Recall that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/28/wsj-openai-apple">Apple walked away from a big investment in OpenAI</a> just four months ago.) A -2% hit feels about right.</p></li><li><p> The broadest implication of DeepSeek&#39;s achievements is that really good AI is going to be even cheaper and more openly available than expected — sooner than expected. That&#39;s bad news for Google, whose entire enterprise value is based around their having an unassailable and sustainable lead in these areas. Google doesn&#39;t have to worry about <em>a</em> competitor coming along to rival them in search. They have to worry that the entire field of “search” is on the cusp of being commoditized. Thus the -4% hit.</p></li><li><p> Meta, the thinking goes, benefits as generative AI becomes cheaper. That&#39;s why Meta&#39;s own AI efforts are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40078025">sorta-kinda open source</a> . Meta has nothing to do with DeepSeek, but DeepSeek&#39;s achievements seem perfectly aligned with Meta&#39;s own interests in AI.</p></li><li><p> Apple benefits, indirectly, in at least two ways from DeepSeek&#39;s breakthroughs. First, a vast increase in the inference capabilities of RAM-constrained hardware strongly suggests that Apple&#39;s consumer devices will soon be able to perform far more AI computation locally. Apple Silicon&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686">shared memory architecture</a> is perfect for this — and still un-replicated by anyone else in the industry. Second, Apple&#39;s decades-long <a href="https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/10/13/apple-vs-nvidia-what-happened.html">standoffish relationship with Nvidia</a> suddenly looks like less of a problem.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘CNBC: ‘Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China’s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Ben Thompson&#39;s DeepSeek FAQ </title><link href="https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41518</id><published> 2025-01-27T21:19:29Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T21:45:54Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese AI lab DeepSeek <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/">made waves last week</a> when they dropped their new “open reasoning” LLM named R1. But over the weekend the full repercussions of their achievements (plural) began to sink in across the industry. My partner-in-Dithering Ben Thompson has written an extraordinarily helpful FAQ-style explanation at Stratechery today. If you, like me, were looking at the news today and thinking “Jeebus what the hell is going on with this DeepSeek thing?”, read Thompson&#39;s piece first. Two choice excerpts, first regarding OpenAI:</p><blockquote><p> R1 is notable, however, because o1 stood alone as the only reasoning model on the market, and the clearest sign that OpenAI was the market leader.</p><p> R1 undoes the o1 mythology in a couple of important ways. First, there is the fact that it exists. OpenAI does not have some sort of special sauce that can&#39;t be replicated. Second, R1 — like all of DeepSeek&#39;s models — has open weights (the problem with saying “open source” is that we don&#39;t have the data that went into creating it). This means that instead of paying OpenAI to get reasoning, you can run R1 on the server of your choice, or even locally, at dramatically lower cost.</p></blockquote><p> Second, regarding DeepSeek&#39;s use of <a href="https://snorkel.ai/blog/llm-distillation-demystified-a-complete-guide/">distillation</a> (using existing LLMs to train new smaller ones):</p><blockquote><p> Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves. We are watching the assembly of an AI takeoff scenario in realtime.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ben Thompson’s DeepSeek FAQ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Removes &#39;2024&#39; Timeframe From Next-Generation CarPlay Page </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-removes-2024-from-next-gen-carplay-page/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41517</id><published> 2025-01-27T16:58:16Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T16:58:17Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>10 years ago I ran a sponsorship from Meh, a then-new daily deals site from the founders of Woot (the OG daily deals site).

For reference, a USB-C port is 2.6mm at minimum.</p></blockquote><p> I see four possible futures:</p><p> (a) We never see phones thinner than 4mm, and USB-C will be with us forever.</p><p> (b) When we start getting phones thinner than USB-C allows, they abandon plug-in ports entirely and move exclusively to inductive connections (eg MagSafe) for both charging and data.</p><p> (c) One or more companies — most likely Apple — devises a proprietary charging and data port that is significantly thinner than USB-C.</p><p> (d) The USB Consortium devises an industry-standard, significantly thinner successor to the USB-C connector, and the EU swiftly updates its regulations to allow it as an alternative to USB-C.</p><p> Option (a) strikes me as guaranteed wrong. We will, sooner or later, see phones that are too thin for a USB-C port. The only question is when.</p><p> Option (b) seems entirely plausible for consumer-targeted devices, but the literally <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">professional-caliber video features</a> enabled in iPhone Pro models with USB-C ports would be impossible, at the moment, to offer via any existent inductive connector. Because of the ubiquity of USB, no one has even tried establishing a inductive connector for high-speed data transfer. Data transfer could be the limiting factor that keeps professional phones on USB-C for the near future, but the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108361">Smart Connector</a> on the back of recent iPad models handles both charging and data (albeit low-speed data transfer, intended only for trackpad and keyboard输入）。 The thinnest-ever <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">iPhone 17 “Air” model that&#39;s much-rumored for this September</a> is expected <em>alongside</em> iPhone 17 Pro models, not <em>in place</em> of them. If it proves popular I could see a near future where the iPhone “Air” drops its USB-C port and goes MagSafe-only for charging, with all data transfer taking place wirelessly (meaning over the air, via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), while the iPhone Pro models, with thicker batteries and both more and better cameras, keep their USB-C ports for a few additional years, until they too go inductive-charging exclusive, perhaps with a breakthrough magnetic Smart Connector that supports high-speed data transfer. I suspect this is the path we&#39;ll see that delivers too-thin-for-USB-C-port phones and tablets. And I believe it would neatly remain within the EU&#39;s charging port regulations, but would irritate proponents of those regulations, because it&#39;s unlikely Apple would choose to make such a Super Smart Connector an open standard. (The EU USB-C mandate applies only to charging <em>ports</em> , which is why Apple Watches, to name one prominent example of a device that charges only inductively, via a proprietary connector, remain available there.)</p><p> Option (c), of course, would be disallowed in the EU, meaning such phones either wouldn&#39;t be sold in the EU, or the company that made them (which, let&#39;s face it, would be Apple) would need to make different models for sale in the EU that omit the proprietary port and charge only via MagSafe/Qi. My spidey-sense says this just isn&#39;t worth working on, and thus won&#39;t happen. I can imagine a port and connector that are thinner than USB-C — something that looks like Lightning, but thinner — but to maintain any sort of structural rigidity, it couldn&#39;t be <em>that</em> much thinner than USB-C, and thus wouldn&#39;t enable the creation of phones or tablets that are <em>that</em> much thinner than USB-C ports allow. What I can imagine are phones and tablets that are more like credit cards in thickness. But there are so many engineering challenges that need to be solved to get there — battery technology, display technology, chip efficiency, and probably a dozen more.</p><p> Option (d) makes me laugh just thinking about it.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Thin Is In</title></entry><entry><title> Jessica Lessin&#39;s 2014 Profile of Kim Vorrath </title><link href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-s-software-taskmaster-faces-tough-test?rc=jfy0lk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w15" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/lessin-vorrath" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41513</id><published> 2025-01-25T01:27:49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-25T16:50:27Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jessica Lessin, writing for The Information back in 2014:</p><blockquote><p> Ms. Vorrath, who has worked on all seven iOS releases, generally operates by asking lots of questions of engineers, sticking to the facts and getting them to explain in plain English why a particular feature should be included in the operating system.

<p>Mark Gurman has an interesting scoop at Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.</p><p> Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple&#39;s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She&#39;ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn&#39;t been announced publicly. [...]</p><p> Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple&#39;s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow Vorrath&#39;s name has never before appeared on Daring Fireball, but she&#39;s renowned within Apple, legendary even, for her leadership role in managing the creation and development of the software for the original iPhone, effectively serving as Scott Forstall&#39;s chief of staff. Her reputation is that she&#39;s a great manager — she gets shit done, knows how to ship, and talented people enjoy and thrive working for her. But outside Apple she&#39;s largely flown under the radar — which only emphasizes how much of an Apple person&#39;s Apple person she is.</p><p> I checked with a source who&#39;s worked with Vorrath for years, and their comment says it all: “She kicks all the asses.”</p><blockquote><p> The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.</p></blockquote><p> My sense is that it&#39;s less about Siri and Apple Intelligence being more important than VisionOS, and more about Siri being a mess. More about urgency than importance. But perhaps it&#39;s <em>both</em> more urgent and more important long-term. Either way, assigning Vorrath — perhaps Apple&#39;s best fixer, and without question one of Apple&#39;s best fixers — makes sense. As <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">my piece yesterday illustrated</a> , something is rotten in the state of SiriLand.</p><p> Also very interesting: Gurman citing “a longtime Apple executive” as his source. Not “a source familiar with the matter”, but “a longtime Apple executive”. No “former” in there either. Apple generally doesn&#39;t want personnel changes made public, but this one, I think is an exception. Siri is terrible, far behind the competition, and everyone from Cupertino to Wall Street knows it.</p><p> Apple sending in Kim Vorrath is like Marsellus Wallace sending in Winston Wolfe.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Moves Kim Vorrath to Siri / Apple Intelligence Team’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/vorrath-siri-apple-intelligence">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w10" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/01/fucking_amazon_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41508</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-01-23T00:05:39Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:05:40Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>苹果：</p><blockquote><p> Click the amount you wish to contribute, then click Donate and Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires.</p></blockquote><p> Apple has prominent links to its Red Cross donation form on the web and in the App Store. They&#39;ve been doing this after catastrophes and disasters <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/27/nepal-red-cross-itunes">around the world</a> for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/13/red-cross">a long time</a> . On the surface, it&#39;s great because it&#39;s so easy. Apple already has your saved credentials so it takes just a few taps or clicks to donate. You can measure the time to donate in seconds, not minutes.</p><p> But an under-appreciated aspect of Apple acting as a front-end to the Red Cross is that your donation remains completely private. There&#39;s quite a lot of small print on the donation screen, which starts:</p><blockquote><p> Because Apple is not sharing your personal information with the American Red Cross, the American Red Cross is unable to further acknowledge your donation. You will receive an email receipt from Apple, which will serve as the only record of your donation. The donation will also appear on your credit card statement as a transaction with Apple. You do not purchase any goods or receive any services from Apple by making a donation. Any donation collected by Apple is collected in the name, and on behalf, of the American Red Cross. This donation may not qualify for any tax deduction or other tax benefits. By donating through Apple, you acknowledge that any tax consequences to you in making the donation (including, but not limited to, ensuring you have sufficient documentation to claim any applicable tax deduction) shall be your responsibility. Apple Account credit cannot be used to make a donation. Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires (including Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Kern, Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial Counties).</p></blockquote><p> This sounds like a bunch of ignorable legalese but what it really means is quite interesting. You&#39;re not giving to the Red Cross through this. You&#39;re giving money to Apple, and Apple will then transfer 100 percent of it to the Red Cross. I&#39;m almost certain, for example, that Apple is covering the cost of the card transaction fees.</p><p> By donating this way, you will never get junk mail, email, or text messages from the Red Cross, or from any “partner” of the Red Cross, soliciting additional donations, because the Red Cross will never get your name, address, or数字。 All they get is your money.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/28/messages-political-spam">Back in August I wrote about</a> how my political solicitations via SMS had gotten so out of control, so downright annoying, that my wife and I had scaled back our donations to political campaigns, because it was obvious that previous campaigns we had donated to had shared or sold our information. We&#39;d been put on a Suckers List.</p><p> The same thing, sadly, happens with charities. People generally don&#39;t want to admit to selfishness, but I will. When I give money to a charitable cause, I always look for the checkboxes to opt out of being contacted by them in the future. When it happens anyway, I get annoyed, and I become reluctant to give to that charity again. And because it has happened repeatedly, it&#39;s made me at least somewhat more reluctant to give to <em>any</em> charitable cause in the first place. I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling that way.</p><p> When you donate to the Red Cross via Apple, that concern is off the table. Apple won&#39;t emphasize that aspect of this, because they don&#39;t want to throw the Red Cross under the proverbial bus, but I will. An underrated aspect of privacy is the desire simply not to be annoyed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Southern California Wildfire Relief: Consider Donating to the Red Cross Through Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/apple-red-cross-socal-fire-relief">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Ship That Leaks From the Top Is Back </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.rE4.mJTz.1TTdhPOAPRw-&amp;smid=url-share" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41506</id><published> 2025-01-22T21:41:08Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:53:09Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From a multi-byline profile of Stephen Miller in The New York Times last week:</p><blockquote><p> Mr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J. Trump&#39;s terms. He made clear that Mr. Trump would crack down on immigration and go to war against the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, culture that had been embraced by Meta and much of corporate America in recent years.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg was amenable. He signaled to Mr. Miller and his colleagues, including other senior Trump advisers, that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting, who asked for anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would instead focus solely on building tech products.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees&#39; self-expression in the workplace, according to one of the people with knowledge of the meeting. He said new guidelines and a series of layoffs amounted to a reset and that more changes were coming.</p></blockquote><p> This account of the meeting clearly leaked from Trump&#39;s side, not Meta&#39;s side. The tone of it is that Miller told Zuckerberg to jump, and that Zuck obsequiously and gladly responded “How high?”</p><p> Zuckerberg scrambled for cover, posting a “Sheryl did amazing work at Meta and will forever be a legend in the industry [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DE8CZDKSPkw">tweet to Threads</a> , followed by a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lfxlauieic2f">coordinated</a> “Thank you, @zuck. I will always be grateful for the many years we spent building a great business together [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/DE8GHndSWq4">reply from Sandberg</a> . (Sandberg, who left Meta in 2022, only posted <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/C6OdV4Zr6pf">once</a> to Threads in all of 2024. There&#39;s a good chance this will be her only post in 2025.)</p><p> Zuckerberg, politically, seems in way over his head. The first Trump administration was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-trump-aide-says-witnessed-kellyanne-conway-leaking-information-media-220749233.html">infamous for its leaks</a> . They barely hid it. The whole Trump brand is about brazenness. For decades, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/13/trump-john-miller">Trump was known to call reporters in New York under the guise of “John Miller” or “John Barron”</a> , who were ostensibly public relations spokesmen representing Trump. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_used_by_Donald_Trump">it was just him</a> — and he didn&#39;t even disguise his voice. He just did it.</p><p> So of course Stephen Miller (or Miller&#39;s equivalent of John Barron) leaked the confidential nature of his discussion with Zuckerberg to The New York Times, because it made Miller look dominating and Zuckerberg look dominated. Even though it&#39;s painfully obvious to anyone who sees this story that anything confidential they tell Stephen Miller might get leaked if it makes Miller look good. It&#39;s like a perversion of your Miranda rights, a Miranda <em>wrongs</em> if you will: Anything you say to anyone in the Trump administration can and will be used against you in leaks to the media.</p><p> You don&#39;t see stories like this about Cook or Nadella or Bezos, because I think those guys have the good sense to keep their mouths shut and just nod their heads. (Not Musk, though. When Trump and Musk eventually divorce in a spectacular flame-out, we&#39;ll be deluged with stories about what Musk said in supposed confidence.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Ship That Leaks From the Top Is Back’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Legal Nerdery on Trump&#39;s TikTok Executive Order </title><link href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump's-tiktok-executive-order-and-the-limits-of-executive-non-enforcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/legal-nerdery-on-trumps-tiktok-executive-order" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41505</id><published> 2025-01-22T20:37:49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-22T20:37:49Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alan Rozenshtein, writing for Lawfare:</p><blockquote><p> While Apple and Google maintained their compliance, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online">Oracle and Akamai made the remarkable decision to resume services</a> , despite facing potentially catastrophic liability rates. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump followed through by <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-orders-75-day-pause-on-tiktok-law-enforcement">issuing an executive order</a> that suspended PAFACAA enforcement for 75 days and attempted to provide retroactive protection for any violations before and during the nonenforcement period.</p><p> TikTok&#39;s tech partners face a key executive power question: Can they rely on Trump&#39;s promises not to enforce PAFACAA?

<p>From Apple&#39;s developer release notes for iOS 18.3, now at release candidate (RC) status:</p><blockquote><p> For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes">Same for MacOS 15.3</a> Sequoia, which is also at RC status and expected next week.</p><p> I have mixed feelings about this decision. It&#39;s pretty obvious that Apple Intelligence has a slew of shortcomings. It&#39;s the nature of the beast, though, that it&#39;s always going to have some shortcomings. <em>Human</em> intelligence, which to date remains the gold standard for intelligence in general, has some pretty glaring shortcomings, so it&#39;s unsurprising that all artificial intelligence systems still do too. (Perhaps that&#39;s a good metric for defining the next inflection point, now that the Turing Test has been passed: When humans need to ask AI systems to explain their own shortcomings, because we&#39;re no longer smart enough to detect them ourselves.)</p><p> So the bar shouldn&#39;t be “has obvious shortcomings”. It&#39;s whether Apple Intelligence is good enough. Compared to other systems, like ChatGPT, no, it&#39;s not good enough. But Apple has been enabling Siri by default since 2011. And Siri, today, is arguably worse than it&#39;s ever been when compared to the state of the art. A friend just sent me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/siri-or-your-own-lii-ing-eyes.jpeg">this screenshot</a> after asking Siri “Who won Super Bowl 13?” and getting this answer: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. In addition to wrongly casing the Roman numerals, LII is 52, not 13. The only way Siri could have been more wrong would be if the Eagles hadn&#39;t even won Super Bowl 52. I just tried the same question — “Who won Super Bowl 13?” — on both my iPhone running iOS 18.3 RC1 and my Mac running MacOS 15.1.1, and Siri gave me the same wrong answer, on both devices, both when the question was spoken aloud and when it was typed: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. Siri, today, is an unfunny joke.</p><p> But so I think it&#39;s reasonable to ask whether Apple Intelligence is as good as Siri. I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s about how good Apple Intelligence is. In fact, I&#39;d say several of the Apple Intelligence features — Clean Up in Photos, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">notification summaries</a> — are <em>better</em> than Siri. So if Siri has been on by default for over a decade, sure, Apple should go ahead and turn Apple Intelligence on by default too.</p><p> I think there could be significant benefit to turning it on by default, sort of in the spirit of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">dogfooding</a> . Enabling Apple Intelligence features by default will increase the pressure on Apple to keep improving it at a fast clip. It&#39;s also the case that none of Apple Intelligence&#39;s features, with the possible exception of notification summaries, are in the user&#39;s face at all. You have to invoke them to use them. If you don&#39;t want them — or don&#39;t even know about them — you won&#39;t notice anything different once they&#39;re enabled by default. Apple may or may not be <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171226-00/?p=97655">over-indexing</a> on Apple Intelligence, but, thankfully, they&#39;re <em>not</em> shoving it in users&#39; faces.</p><p> But, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">as I wrote two weeks ago</a> , enabling it by default for all users really puts the lie to their claim that all of Apple Intelligence is “beta”. If it&#39;s not just merely shipping to all users, but now enabled by default, that&#39;s not beta. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/beta-is-not-an-excuse-archive">That&#39;s just buggy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Next Week’s iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Updates Will Enable Apple Intelligence During Onboarding’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-macos-153-apple-intelligence-default-onboarding">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Support: &#39;About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Apple Support document, which is linked from the App Store if you search for any of the apps from ByteDance:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025. [...]</p><p> If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will remain on your device. But they can&#39;t be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.</p><p> Users in the United States won&#39;t receive updates for these apps, which could potentially impact performance, security, and compatibility with future versions of iOS and iPadOS, and some app functions might become limited or stop working since the app can&#39;t receive updates 。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">My take from Sunday</a> on Trump&#39;s reprieve-by-executive-fiat seems correct: it has no bearing on the law. Really, all his executive order does is instruct the Justice Department (or as he would call it, <em>his</em> Justice Department) not to enforce the law for 75 days, and to promise any company that violates the PAFACA law that they won&#39;t be prosecuted为此。 There&#39;s really no question about it: Oracle and Akamai are violating the law by providing services to TikTok users in the United States. They&#39;re simply taking Trump at his word that the law will not be enforced and they will not face penalties for violating it during Trump&#39;s completely arbitrary 75-day grace period.</p><p> That&#39;s not like a pardon. Trump&#39;s executive order yesterday carries no more legal weight than a Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” card. I don&#39;t think it will happen but there&#39;s nothing that would stop the Trump Justice Department from changing its mind and prosecuting Oracle and Akamai for these violations. It&#39;s up to Trump. There&#39;s also nothing that would stop a future Justice Department under a post-Trump administration from holding them accountable for this.</p><p> Apple and Google are both sticking with the actual law.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Support: ‘About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Wesley Hilliard, writing for AppleInsider regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">Edits</a> , Meta&#39;s pre-announced mobile-first video editing app:</p><blockquote><p> Despite that, many apps and features on iPhone toe the line between fun tool and social platform. One of those tools was Clips, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/06/apple-launches-new-social-focused-clips-video-editing-app-for-iphone-ipad">arrived in 2017</a> to little fanfare and has been forgotten since.</p><p> Meta and ByteDance have a reason to push their respective video editing apps — brand synergy. More users mean more data, more content, and more ad revenue. Apple, however, doesn&#39;t have the same motivation.</p><p> While Apple would likely love to see users flock to Clips, it would mean entering a race to satisfy a wave of several million customers in an app and interface that was never really more than a proof of concept. It would be a money pit with very little reward as Apple doesn&#39;t have a social platform to drive users to or a way to monetize the app.</p></blockquote><p> I completely agree with Hilliard that the announcement of Edits is the perfect time to mention Clips. I completely disagree with him that Apple has no motivation to dedicate itself to the task of making Clips incredible.</p><p> A mobile-first video editor isn&#39;t a “money pit”. It&#39;s an app. Apple makes a lot of apps, and they could easily afford to assign a team to make Clips truly great. It&#39;s no different than 20–25 years ago, when Apple dedicated itself to making iMovie and Final Cut both great apps. It&#39;s no different than the motivation to create GarageBand. The monetization wouldn&#39;t be direct; it would be downstream of the general idea that if you&#39;re editing videos for social media on your phone, the best app to do it with is from Apple and it&#39;s exclusively available on iPhone. The idea is that Apple doesn&#39;t just make the best computing devices for artists, writers, and creators, but they also make some of the best apps for those fields too.</p><p> There are actually a lot of interesting UI ideas in Clips. But if Apple isn&#39;t interested in making Clips truly great for people who actually love editing videos using their phones, they should just abandon it. Make it great or give up. Keeping it around as an also-ran that no one uses is a bad look. This is the sort of thing Apple should pride itself on: best-of-breed creative tools.</p><p> I don&#39;t know if Edits is a rip-off of CapCut or not, but it&#39;s definitely not a rip-off of Clips. It&#39;s a good rule of thumb that when Apple succeeds at something, it gets ripped off. The better the Apple product, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/22/byford-china-android-forks">the more shamelessly it gets copied</a> . Apple should make Clips into an iOS video editing app that everyone rips off shamelessly.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Remember Clips?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Teases &#39;Edits&#39;, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347358/instagram-edits-capcut-video-app-tiktok-ban" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41499</id><published> 2025-01-21T00:34:09Z</published><updated> 2025-01-21T00:34:10Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wes Davis, writing at The Verge, under the headline “Instagram Announces a Blatant CapCut Clone”:</p><blockquote><p> Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBIzLAynIQ/">just announced</a> a video editing app called Edits. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFBNqdGSee4?xmt=AQGzCOMan-oc70fxP0uSA3x3sZd58_GJeUpjK1AD4X30tA">Mosseri said</a> the app is meant to rival CapCut, a video editing app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">went offline along with TikTok</a> . Edits is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378">preorder on the iOS App Store</a> .</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t use CapCut (and can&#39;t download it now), so I can&#39;t judge whether the screenshots of Edits indicate that it&#39;s a copycat of CapCut (say that five times fast), which would be pretty funny coming so closely on the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/">Zuckerberg&#39;s claim on Joe Rogan&#39;s show</a> that Apple hasn&#39;t invented anything new since the iPhone, or if it&#39;s just a different take on a video editing app for phones. Adobe InDesign was absolutely designed to make QuarkXPress users feel at home, but it wasn&#39;t a rip-off or clone. It was (and remains) an Adobe take on Quark-style page layout.

<p>Interesting selection of Martin Luther King Jr. quotes they&#39;ve chosen for the homepage ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/apple.com-mlk-2025.pdf">PDF archive for posterity</a> ):</p><blockquote><ul><li> “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.”</li><li> “You must decide to speak for yourself; nobody else can speak for you.”</li><li> “We cannot preserve self without being concerned about preserving other selves.”</li></ul></blockquote><p> Read into those quotes what you will, given today&#39;s other national significance. I think there&#39;s an implied message here, but it&#39;s subtle.

<p>Tim Cook on X:</p><blockquote><p> Dr. King once said, “Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.”真正的伟大在于举起他人，有所作为并有目的地服务。 Let&#39;s honor his legacy by finding ways to serve and create a better world together.</p></blockquote><p> Curious to see if that&#39;s Cook&#39;s only tweet of the day, or if a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">congratulatory one</a> is forthcoming, after Trump&#39;s oath of office at noon. <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1881426564749156537">Here&#39;s the congratulatory tweet</a> , posted at 2:40pm. No exclamation marks this time.</p><p> Apple has been dedicating its homepage to MLK on his holiday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/search/?s=martin+luther+king+jr">for at least 10 years</a> , so <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk">today</a> isn&#39;t some exception just because it&#39;s also Inauguration Day. But it&#39;s perhaps worth pointing out that few among Apple&#39;s corporate peers are doing this. The homepages of (in market cap order), Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla make no mention of either MLK <em>or</em> Trump&#39;s inauguration. Just another day on the calendar for all of them. But I&#39;m not sure any of those companies ever tend to celebrate holidays on their company homepages.</p><p> But the one company that is famous for its holiday “doodles” is Google. And <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025.pdf">Google&#39;s homepage today</a> makes no mention today of MLK, but does direct visitors&#39; attention to their hosted livestream of Trump&#39;s inauguration. Not a doodle, just “🇺🇸 Live! Watch President Trump&#39;s Inauguration”, and nothing about MLK. [ <strong>Update, 2:15 pm:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025-2.pdf">Google.com now has a nice MLK doodle</a> . Perhaps it was a pre- and post-inauguration distinction? Others report seeing the MLK hopscotch doodle all day.]</p><p> If you want to argue that all of these companies, and each of their CEOs, suck, today&#39;s your day. But there are degrees of sucking, and <s>one</s> two of these companies are, still, to some degree, not quite like the others.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Cook Pep-Talks Himself’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/cook-mlk">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WorkOS Radar </title><link href="https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/19/workos-radar" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41494</id><published> 2025-01-20T04:00:00Z</published><updated> 2025-01-20T15:22:23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
