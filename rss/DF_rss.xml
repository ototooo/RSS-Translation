<p>周二的“Wonderlust”事件基本上是可以预见的吗？是的。这是否意味着它很无聊？对于某些人来说，是的。但对于大多数人来说，这是今年最大的科技新闻事件，就像每年晚些时候的苹果 iPhone 发布会一样。</p><p>从历史上看，这既奇怪又新鲜——对于许多技术爱好者来说，这令人失望。传统上，科技公司的运作方式是，公司的命运在每个十年中都会起伏不定。而大型新的“年度科技产品”不仅每隔几年就会从一家公司更换到另一家公司，而且还会在不同的产品类别中发生变化。从 PC 到 PDA，从数码相机到 iPod。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-15">1</a></sup></p><p>但在过去的十年里，整个科技界最盛大的事件是苹果公司每年推出的新款 iPhone。你可能会说这不应该是今年最大的事件，但从媒体报道的角度来看，它客观上确实如此。我不确定我认识的人是否至少不知道苹果公司本周刚刚发布了新款 iPhone。仅此一点就很了不起。这很像超级碗，它通常甚至不是一年中最好的橄榄球比赛，更不用说体育赛事了，但无可否认是最大的。即使不看超级碗的人也知道超级碗何时举行。但即使是超级碗也只是美国的现象——iPhone赛事是全球性的，更像是世界杯或奥运会，但世界杯和奥运会每四年才举办一次。</p><p>就像超级碗吸引了体育新闻界以外的媒体关注一样，iPhone 事件也吸引了科技界以外的媒体报道。亲自参加 iPhone 活动会有一种完全不同且独特的氛围。从媒体参加者的角度来看，这些 iPhone 活动充斥着一种嗡嗡声、一种忙碌感和期待感，最重要的是，一种明显的、难以想象的高风险感弥漫在其中。你可以说这些事件很无聊，因为它们是可以预测的，但苹果需要每一代 iPhone 都成为热门产品，媒体知道这一点，而且媒体总是在寻找一个失误来详细说明，比如天线门的无意义争议早在 2010 年，iPhone 4 就出现了<sup id="fnr2-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-15">。2</a></sup>铁杆体育迷对围绕超级碗的所有非体育方面感到恼火，例如将注意力集中在中场音乐会表演者甚至电视广告上。铁杆科技迷同样对“你去过哪个星球？”感到恼火。我们其他人都知道新 iPhone 的细节将会像去年一样出现。证据 A：本周的主流新闻报道<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+usb-c&amp;iar=news&amp;df=w&amp;ia=news">完全以从 Lightning 到 USB-C 的转换为主导</a>。</p><p>史蒂夫·乔布斯剧院是一个美妙的地方，对我来说，这些 iPhone 活动是令人着迷的体验。 （<a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CxGiLfSPqOX">我周二拍摄了一段视频</a>，试图捕捉主题演讲后动手区域的布局和体验。）但从“我想知道苹果今天要宣布什么”的意义上来说，它们一点也不有趣。 ”这更像是对苹果<em>如何</em>选择如何构建我们都知道即将发布的公告的浓厚兴趣。将新款 iPhone 的推出与新款 Apple Watch 的推出以及今年更新的 AirPods Pro 结合起来，是完美但乏味的。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn3-2023-09-15">3</a></sup></p><p>不过，这又不是科技行业“应该”运作的方式。一切都会结束，最终这个不言而喻的道理将适用于 iPhone，但事实是，十多年来，苹果公司的 9 月 iPhone 活动一直是科技界的超级碗。来自同一家公司的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">迭代</a>手机设计，年复一年。没有其他事件可以与之相比。您可以将接下来的 10 个事件加在一起（包括 Apple 的事件），并且您不会获得 iPhone 事件的累计电量。尽管 iPhone 事件是可以预见的，但这一点还是存在的。从来没有发生过这样的事情，很可能永远不会再发生，而且很多科技爱好者对此感到不满。</p><p>但不可否认这是事实。苹果有一个公式，而且这个公式仍然有效。</p><h2>环境</h2><p>主题演讲中由奥克塔维亚·斯宾塞饰演的 20 分钟<a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/mother-nature/">“大自然”小品</a>遭到了<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/13/apples-mother-nature-sketch-was-a-complete-dud-and-didnt-belong-in-the-iphone-15-event">广泛</a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/apple-mocked-cringey-sketch-touting-companys-climate-change-efforts-filled-left-wing-tropes">批评</a>。我确实认为它持续得太长了——整个片段（草图加细节）实际上只有 10 分钟长，而不是 20 分钟。但似乎每个人，包括我，都觉得它持续了 20 分钟，这从来都不是一个好兆头。</p><p>但我明白了。</p><p>传达的信息是：当今大多数公司都对其未来的环境影响做出承诺。但苹果不仅仅只是做出承诺。他们在这方面取得了真正伟大的成就。现在你可以购买整块碳中和的 Apple Watch，这可不是开玩笑。苹果公司在其使用的材料、在世界各地运输产品的方式、包装方式、自己发电的方式等方面都做出了巨大的改变。他们想要明确的是，整个领域是公司的最高优先事项之一，真正是其制度道德指南针的一部分，对苹果所做的<em>一切</em>都有影响，而且他们已经取得了伟大的成就。大多数其他公司基本上只是在这些东西上进行绿色清洗。</p><p>但苹果如何证明这一点呢？他们不能只是把丽莎·杰克逊放在那里，然后指责其他公司是企业骗子，尽管它们确实是骗子。喜剧就是答案。喜剧可以让你说出原本无法说的话。<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm">讽刺</a>、戏仿和闹剧都是传达严肃论点的极具欺骗性的有力方式。</p><p>这一段的问题很简单，就是不够有趣。这是一个很棒的概念，但结果还算可以。它需要更多 Tina Fey <em>30 Rock 的</em>节奏——更有趣的笑话和更多的笑话。 （苹果公司是否因为 WGA 对此的罢工而受到阻碍？我不禁想知道是否如此。这个短剧<em>看起来</em>不错——只是文字感觉软弱无力。）</p><p>这一领域的一个里程碑式的变化是苹果公司宣称其产品全部采用皮革制成。不再有 iPhone 皮革保护壳、皮革表带——包括爱马仕的皮革表带。他们利润丰厚的合作关系仍在继续，但仅限于织物和橡胶表带。 （除非你<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/15/hermes-leather-apple-watch-straps">从 Hermès 自己</a>购买 Apple Watch。）Apple 已经用一种名为 FineWoven 的新材料取代了自己的皮革 iPhone 保护壳和表带。我花了一些时间在动手区摆弄新的手机壳和表带，我喜欢 FineWoven 材料。主题演讲仅强调了相对于皮革的道德角度：碳影响和动物权利。但至少对于 iPhone 手机壳来说，我认为 FineWoven 比旧的皮革手机壳要好得多。我个人喜欢漂亮的皮革制品，但我总觉得苹果用来生产 iPhone 保护壳的皮革充其量只是还可以。特别是，我认为它的耐候性不太好，而且我从来都不是 iPhone 保护壳的重度用户，通常我的手机壳都是不带保护壳的。抛开所有道德问题，假装苹果仍在销售皮革 iPhone 保护壳和这些新的 FineWoven 保护壳，我宁愿购买 FineWoven 保护壳。根据我的实践经验，我并不完全相信 FineWoven Apple Watch 表带，但最坏的情况是，它们看起来相当不错。 （苹果的皮革表带比爱马仕的便宜，但也明显不如爱马仕的好。）</p><p>新箱子的预订已经开始到货，<a href="https://www.threads.net/search/?q=finewoven">人们对新材料的反应不一</a>。我很好奇它会随着时间的推移而变得如何，尤其是表带，但我的第一印象是，这是对苹果皮革产品的<em>质量</em>升级，而不仅仅是道德方面的升级。我不认为 FineWoven 材料比优质皮革更好，但我确实认为它比苹果制造的皮革 iPhone 保护壳更好，也许与他们自己以前的皮革表带相当。但它不是的一件事是人造皮革。如果 Jony Ive 还在苹果，他可能会这样描述它：毫无疑问，它是一种布料。</p><h2>普通 iPhone 15</h2><p> iPhone 15（非 Pro 版）似乎正是我们所希望的：实际上，iPhone 14 Pro 没有长焦第三个摄像头。</p><p>这让我对这些颜色吹毛求疵，在我看来，这些颜色平淡无奇，除了黑色之外，它和往常一样，确实是一种非常深的黑色。颜色趋势随季节变化，我可能应该更相信苹果的设计师而不是我自己来保持潮流的领先地位，但是伙计，这个阵容看起来平淡无奇。也许浅色调今年会“流行”，但我非常怀疑今后是否有人会说“还记得 iPhone 15 的颜色有多棒吗？”与我们<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary">对初代 iMac 的</a>普遍喜爱进行比较和对比。</p><p>今年的新功能：普通版 iPhone 15 采用磨砂玻璃后背；迄今为止，非专业型号是光面的，专业型号是磨砂/哑光的。第一次，Pro 版和<em>非</em>Pro 版 iPhone 的手感非常相似：拉丝金属侧面、磨砂玻璃背面、非常相似的尺寸，以及相似的重量。</p><p> iPhone 15 显示屏更亮，与 15 Pro 型号的显示屏具有相同的对比度和最大亮度。不过，非专业版 iPhone 15 机型缺少：ProMotion 动态刷新率和常亮显示模式。反过来，缺乏常亮显示屏意味着 iOS 17 中的新待机功能对于 Pro 机型来说更加有用。对于非专业版 iPhone 15，“待机”只会显示，直到显示超时并进入睡眠状态；对于 iPhone Pro（包括去年的 14 Pro 型号），待机功能始终处于开启状态。</p><h2> iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p> Pro 型号的颜色选择符合最新趋势：黑色（实际上更像是深灰色）、白色和年度颜色。去年 iPhone 14 Pro 的颜色是紫色。今年是蓝色，而且是漂亮但相当深的蓝色。有趣的是，还有“天然钛”，这并不是真正的天然，而是通过 PVD ​​色调实现的，看起来就像人们<em>认为的</em>钛一样，这为苹果最近对颜色没有太多<em>乐趣的</em>论点增添了更多的依据。自然看起来像。就其本身而言，“天然钛”看起来像中性拉丝金属色调。然而，与白色的 iPhone 15 Pro 放在一起，你可以看到苹果的“天然钛金属”更温暖。它看起来并不全是金色，但有一点点黄色。天然钛合金车型的整体效果是“高级灰色”，有点像经典的<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=james+bond+db5&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">阿斯顿·马丁 DB5</a>的氛围。我认为，白色的可以完全被描述为“银色”——色温真正中性，而且看起来更闪亮。 iPhone 15 Pro 上的自然色和白色钛金属都无法与 Apple Watch Ultra 的钛金属机身相匹配，但自然色更接近。</p><p>与后 iPhone-X 时代的所有不锈钢 iPhone 相比，15 Pro 和 Pro Max 的手感要轻<em>得多</em>。假设它们在现实世界的使用中证明是耐用的，那么仅从重量来看，从抛光不锈钢到钛的转变就是一个巨大的胜利。但我也更喜欢它的外观和感觉——略带纹理，而不是高度抛光。我认为我的 iPhone 是一个工具，而不是珠宝；抛光表面似乎不太合适，就像钢质 Apple Watch 那样。</p><p>框架的圆形边缘——这一设计变化也出现在铝制非专业型号中——也是一个胜利。这感觉像是 iPhone X/XS/11 的完全圆形侧面和 iPhone 12/13/14 的平坦锐边侧面之间的最佳中间地带。预计这种外形尺寸也会在三代中保持稳定——苹果是一家模式公司。</p><p>操作按钮看起来很棒。开箱即用，它默认充当静音切换开关，但选择其他操作很容易（并且可以说<a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1702082368905888058">很有趣</a>）。内置操作包括：手电筒、启动相机应用程序、在语音备忘录中开始录音和放大镜。但是，当您分配它来执行快捷方式工作流程时，选项实际上是无限的。</p><h2>安息吧 iPhone Mini</h2><p>我没想到 iPhone 13 Mini 会留在产品阵容中，但现在官方宣布：它已经消失了。真丢脸。它显然还不够受欢迎，但我认识的每个购买 iPhone 12 Mini 或 13 Mini 的人都喜欢它，并且害怕他们的下一代 iPhone 变得更大。</p><h2> AirPods Pro“2.5”</h2><p>如果你不仔细观察，很容易误认为 AirPods Pro 2 的唯一变化是充电盒上的连接器。但 USB-C AirPods Pro 2 实际上也是不同的<em>耳塞</em>，实际上更像是 2.5 版本或其他版本。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-upgrades-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-with-usb-c-charging/">来自苹果新闻编辑室</a>：</p><blockquote><p> AirPods Pro（第二代）升级为 USB-C 充电功能、额外的防尘功能以及 Apple Vision Pro 无损音频。在 iOS 17 中，所有 AirPods Pro（第二代）都获得了升级，可以获得自适应音频和对话感知等新的音频体验。 [...]</p><p>配备 MagSafe 充电盒 (USB-C) 的 AirPods Pro（第二代）将实现具有超低延迟的无损音频，从而通过 Apple Vision Pro 提供完美的真正无线解决方案。最新 AirPods Pro 和 Apple Vision Pro 中的 H2 芯片与突破性的无线音频协议相结合，可解锁强大的 20 位、48 kHz 无损音频，并大幅减少音频延迟。</p></blockquote><p>从Lightning到USB-C的变化是显而易见的。增加的防尘效果很好。但 Vision Pro 的超低延迟（据我可靠地告诉我，是个位数毫秒）无损音频很有趣。 （我怀疑，对于已经拥有带有 Lightning 保护壳的 AirPods Pro 2 的人来说，这会被认为有点烦人。）</p><h2>摄影和 GPU</h2><p>从表面上看，相机功能和 GPU 规格似乎并不相关，但它们有一个主题相似之处：苹果在这两个领域都处于行业最先进的地位。当然，iPhone 相机并不落后于最先进的<em>手机</em>摄影技术——它们可能是最好的，而且无可否认是最好的。但它们并不是世界上最好的<em>相机</em>，句号。苹果希望他们能够做到这一点，并且年复一年地不懈追求这一目标。虽然 Apple Silicon GPU 无可否认地在<em>手机领域</em>处于市场领先地位，但它们在 PC 领域也无可否认<em>地处于</em>市场领先地位，而 Nvidia 在 PC 领域占据着至高无上的地位。我坚信，苹果希望用 GPU 对付 Nvidia，就像他们用 CPU 对付英特尔一样——在纯粹性能上赶上或超越他们，并在每瓦性能上彻底击败他们。</p><p>在摄影方面，周二宣布了两项主要新功能。第一个是新一代人像摄影，在将图像作为常规静止图像拍摄<em>后，</em>可以将人像模式应用到图像上。自从肖像模式首次亮相以来，我就一直想要这个功能。捕捉时，你不需要做任何该死的事情。您只需构图并按下快门即可。没有切换模式。但设备上的机器学习会当场决定人像模式是否可以改善图像（只有当拍摄对象是人、狗或猫时才会自动发生），但你可以启用它、禁用它，并将其调整为帖子中您的心满意足。</p><p>其次是 iPhone 15 Pro 机型捕捉空间视频的能力。我<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111054476354563569">整个夏天就猜测</a>，如果苹果今年能够为 iPhone 推出这款产品，那就太酷了，他们也做到了。显然，<em>观看</em>空间视频的最佳方式是使用 Vision 耳机，但<em>捕捉</em>空间视频的最佳方式是使用 iPhone，尤其是根据一句古老的格言，最好的相机是随身携带的相机。我认为 iPhone 最终将能够捕捉空间视频记忆，但对我来说，这是苹果公司今年实现的卓越运营和跨设备协作的标志，iPhone 的出货量将比第一款提前几个月——一代 Vision Pro。 （使用 iPhone 15 Pro 拍摄空间视频的功能尚不可用 - 它“将在今年晚些时候推出”。并且动手区域单元没有该功能，也没有预加载任何示例空间视频。因此，唯一的方法是使用 iPhone 15 Pro 拍摄空间视频。我们对该功能的了解是在主题演讲中广播的内容。）</p><p>关于A17 Pro，我们先从名字开始。苹果公司在许多不同的产品上以多种不同的方式使用“pro”，但他们非常一致的一件事是“Pro”产品是唯一具有“pro”组件或功能的产品。 （请注意，例如，ProMotion 动态刷新率仅适用于 iPhone Pro、iPad Pro 和 MacBook Pro。）因此，我认为苹果再次调整了其<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/apples_two-pronged_annual_iphone_strategy">双管齐下的年度 iPhone 战略</a>：我打赌明年的 iPhone 16 和16 Plus 将配备 A17 SoC，但我也打赌该芯片不会是 A17 Pro。也许那将是A17“Bionic”，也许只是没有形容词的“A17”，但我不认为iPhone 15 Pro中搭载的A17 Pro。</p><p>明年的非专业版 A17 可能会有什么不同？我怀疑 GPU 可能不会那么强大（也许，通过分箱，它将提供 5 个核心而不是 6 个），而且我怀疑它可能有 6 GB RAM（如 A16 Bionic 芯片），而不是 8 GB RAM。 A17 Pro。</p><p>但天哪，A17 Pro 的 GPU 好像多强啊。硬件加速光线追踪是一件大事，也是苹果 M 系列芯片（没有）与 Nvidia 和 AMD 的高端 PC GPU（有）之间的主要区别因素。显然，这款新 GPU 不仅是 A17 Pro 的最大亮点，也将成为 Mac 和 iPad（以及最终的 Vision 耳机）M3 系列芯片的最大亮点。 A系列芯片一直拥有世界一流的手机GPU，但苹果也试图缩小PC端的高端GPU差距。</p><p>但当？ A17 Pro 实际上是台积电下一代 3nm 制造工艺的发布。有消息称，苹果已经确保了台积电明年 90-95% 的 3nm 产量，而且听起来台积电的产量可能无法满足 iPhone 15 Pro 的需求——iPhone 15 Pro 型号可能会缺货几个月，来。这是苹果公司双管齐下的年度 iPhone 战略的一个方面<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/apples_two-pronged_annual_iphone_strategy">，我上周没有提到</a>。我认为非 Pro 版 iPhone 15 机型甚至不可能使用 A17 芯片，因为仅为 Pro 版机型生产 A17 芯片就已经够麻烦了。</p><p>因此，仅根据台积电的 3nm 生产能力，我预计今年不会看到 M3 Mac 或 iPad，也许要到<em>明年</em>中旬才会出现。还要记住，15 英寸 M2 MacBook Air 三个月前刚刚推出。对我来说，这表明 M2 至少在明年之前仍将保持“流行”。我认为，希望今年推出新款 M3 MacBook Air 的人们可能会失望。</p><p>它说明了 iPhone 在苹果产品线中的卓越地位——这种卓越地位合理地建立在广泛的受欢迎程度和盈利能力之上——它比任何其他产品都早早地获得了最尖端的芯片。</p><h2> Apple Watch Series 9 和 Ultra 2</h2><p> Series 9 腕表的系列编号继续蚀刻在表背上。但新的 Ultra 并没有在任何地方写上“2”。这只是新的 Ultra。我<em>认为</em>从外观上看，它与去年的初代 Apple Watch Ultra 没有什么区别——你需要打开手表并检查“设置”→“常规”→“关于”，才能判断 Ultra 是第一代还是第二代。苹果几乎从不在其产品的外部标注代号或型号年份。但这似乎是对待两个不同系列 Apple Watch 的不一致方式。这几乎足以让你认为，当 Apple Watch 系列推出时，有一位有影响力的高管认为给它们编号是个好主意，而这位高管已经不再在苹果工作了。</p><p>今年 Apple Watch 最好的新功能当属新的双击手势，可实现手表的非触摸操作。我们必须在实践区域尝试这一点，而且它确实有效™。快速、准确、自然。在主题演讲和营销材料中，苹果说你需要点击拇指和食指，但我用拇指和中指尝试过，效果很好。当您的手因准备食物或携带无法放下的东西而弄脏时，无需再用鼻子触摸手表。双击手势与用于导航 VisionOS 的主要手势类似。 （我现在想到的一个问题是：当您在佩戴 Apple Watch 时使用 Vision Pro，并且用手表手双击时会发生什么？该手势是否适用于两个设备？或者它们是否以某种方式相互协商当你在多个设备的听力范围内说出“Hey Siri”时，Apple 设备已经进行了这样的协商 - 我怀疑当佩戴新的 Apple Watch 时使用 Vision Pro 时，耳机会首先听到双击手势。）</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li

Samsung faltered in 2016 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/international/samsung-galaxy-note7-terminated.html">the batteries in its flagship smartphone spontaneously combusted</a> . Huawei, which was popular in China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html">floundered in 2020</a> after the Trump administration blocked it from buying US technology.</p></blockquote><p> Huawei&#39;s geopolitical travails are another matter, but it seems downright silly to attribute even an iota of the iPhone&#39;s popularity in 2023 to one disastrous Samsung model seven years ago — especially given that Samsung has never put all its “flagship phone” eggs in one basket. But imagine now if that had been the iPhone 7 with the exploding batteries and that was ultimately recalled from the market. The news media is drawn to “ <em>Look how the mighty have fallen</em> ” story narratives like moths to an open flame. If it <em>had</em> been the iPhone 7 instead of the Galaxy Note 7 whose batteries combusted, we&#39;d still be hearing about it in every article about today&#39;s iPhones. Nothing like that has happened with an Apple product since the PowerBook 5300 back in 1995, but that doesn&#39;t mean it <em>can&#39;t</em> happen. The pressure to avoid such a debacle with every single battery and power adapter Apple manufactures is intense.

<p>I came away from Tuesday&#39;s keynote with the impression that, like Apple, Hermès would no longer be making leather Apple Watch straps. But that&#39;s not the case. Apple itself is <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-hermes/">only selling Hermès watches with fabric and rubber straps</a> , but Hermès itself still has 21 leather straps for the Series 9 Hermès watches. Apple&#39;s keynote seemed so adamant about nixing leather that I suspect there are fans of the Hermès leather straps who are disappointed, thinking they&#39;re no longer being produced. But I can see why Apple decided against mentioning it. I don&#39;t think this is an awkward state of affairs, but <em>describing it</em> during the keynote would have been awkward.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hermès Still Sells Leather Apple Watch Straps, But Only Through Their Own Store’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/15/hermes-leather-apple-watch-straps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Verge&#39;s 17-Minute Summary of the iPhone 15 Event</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmaAl2X09E" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/15/verge-iphone-15-event" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40233</id><published> 2023-09-15T04:05:21Z</published><updated> 2023-09-15T04:05:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>There were rampant rumors pre-event that Apple was going to raise the prices for the iPhone Pro models this year, but they didn&#39;t. They did, however, eliminate the 128 GB $1099 iPhone Max model. There&#39;s a 128 GB iPhone 15 Pro for $999, but the entry model Max has 256 GB of storage and costs $1199. That&#39;s $100 higher than last year&#39;s 128 GB 14 Pro Max, but the same price as last year&#39;s 256 GB 14 Pro Max.

<p>It seems like every company is scrambling to stake their claim in the AI goldrush — check out the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/the-ceo-of-kroger-mentioned-ai-8-times-on-the-company-s-earnings-call#xj4y7vzkg">CEO of Kroger promising</a> to bring LLMs into the dairy aisle. And front line workers are following suit–experimenting with AI so they can work faster and do more.</p><p> In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is overflowing with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: punching up emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk.</p><ol><li> <strong>Malware:</strong> Security researchers keep uncovering <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/beware-ai-scams-meta-blocks-1000-plus-links-tied-to-chatgpt-themed-malware">AI-based extensions</a> that steal user data. These extensions play on users&#39; trust of the big tech platforms (“it can&#39;t be dangerous if Google lets it on the Chrome store!”) and they often appear to work, by hooking up to ChatGPT et al&#39;s APIs.</li><li> <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Companies including Apple and Verizon have banned their employees from using LLMs because these products rarely offer a guarantee that a user&#39;s inputs won&#39;t be used as training data.</li><li> <strong>Prompt Injection Attacks:</strong> In this little known but <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">potentially unsolvable attack</a> , hidden text on a webpage directs an AI tool to perform malicious actions–such as exfiltrate data and then delete the records.</li></ol><p> Up until now, most companies have been caught flat-footed by AI, but these risks are too serious to ignore.</p><p> At Kolide, we&#39;re taking a two-part approach to governing AI use.</p><ol><li> <strong>Draft AI policies as a team.</strong> We don&#39;t want to totally ban our team from using AI, we just want to use it safely. So our first step is meeting with representatives from multiple teams to figure out what they&#39;re getting out of AI-based tools, and how we can provide them with secure options that don&#39;t expose critical data or infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>Use Kolide to block malicious tools.</strong> Kolide lets IT and security teams write <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3PJW32Q">Checks that detect device compliance issues</a> , and we&#39;ve already started creating Checks for malicious (or dubious) AI-based tools. Now if an employee accidentally downloads malware, they&#39;ll be prevented from logging into our cloud apps until they&#39;ve removed it.</li></ol><p> Every company will have to craft policies based on their unique needs and concerns, but the important thing is to start now.

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">the iPhone X</a> marked an obvious inflection point in iPhone history: the switch from the original home-button system interface, with Touch ID, to the “all-screen” interface with Face ID. But it also marked a widely misunderstood/under-appreciated (although, it pains me to point out, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/iphone_x_one_year">not by all</a> ) change in Apple&#39;s annual iPhone hardware strategy. Instead of introducing just one new iPhone, in 2017 Apple began introducing <em>two</em> entirely different tiers of new iPhone each year. One “pro”, one “regular”: </p><!-- Markdown table

The real difference has been between the pro and non-pro models. Apple didn&#39;t start naming iPhones “Pro” until the iPhones 11 in 2019, but effectively, they started this “pro” tier with the X in 2017.</p><p> What everyone groks about this strategy is that the pro models are more expensive. Of course they are. But there are a few aspects to Apple&#39;s strategy that many people miss. The most important is that the iPhone Pro models are only produced for one year. If the pattern holds, come next week, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will cease production, and be <em>replaced</em> in the product line by the new 15 Pro models. The non-pro iPhones, however, stay in production for at least two additional years, dropping in price by $100 each year. I find that fascinating, but it&#39;s seldom remarked upon. The iPhones that are the most expensive, most cutting-edge, and I presume the hardest to manufacture are only produced for one single year. That&#39;s an altogether new strategy from the years before the iPhone X, when there was just one new flagship iPhone per year (albeit in two sizes during the iPhone 6-6S-7 years), and most iPhones stayed in the lineup at reduced prices for years to come.</p><p> So while there have been reports that last year&#39;s iPhone 14 Plus hasn&#39;t sold particularly well, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a failure, or even that Apple expected it to sell all that well <em>this</em> past year. To me, the workhorse years for non-pro iPhones are years two and three in the lineup, when they come down in price. People shopping for less expensive iPhones but who want a big-ass screen have never had an option before: the now-year-old iPhone 14 Plus will be that.</p><p> One much-noted change last year is that the non-pro iPhone 14 models remained on the A15 chip from 2021. One less-noted change is that internally, the iPhone 14 is very different from the iPhone 13, despite the fact that both use the same A15 chip. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">iFixit describes the iPhone 14</a> — the non-pro models — as the most repairable iPhones Apple has ever made. The chip remained the same but the internal design was altogether different, and better. The iPhone 14 is a design that was meant to remain in production for years to come.</p><p> We won&#39;t know tomorrow whether this more repairable, more accessible system architecture will repeat with the iPhone 15, but I suspect it will. No matter what, the regular iPhone 15 models will not simply be the iPhones 14 Pro models repackaged in aluminum frames rather than stainless steel. The strategy Apple has achieved, as I see it:</p><ul><li> Pro models: cutting-edge chips, cameras, and materials; will be produced for just one year.</li><li> Non-pro models: refined architecture using the year-old SoC and older camera systems; will be produced for 2-3 years <em>after</em> their launch year.</li></ul><p> The iPhones Pro are far more exciting, but the non-pro iPhones are essential to the lineup and thus to the entire iPhone ecosystem. In sports terms, the Pro models are the offense, and the non-pro models are the defense. The offense gets the glory, but it&#39;s defense, <a href="https://theconversation.com/does-defense-actually-win-championships-89628">they say</a> , that wins championships.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple&#39;s Two-Pronged Annual iPhone Strategy</title></entry><entry><title> At Least the Word &#39;Maniacal&#39; Fits </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/09/11/elon-musk-moved-twitter-servers-himself-in-the-night-new-biography-details-his-maniacal-sense-of-urgency.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40227</id><published> 2023-09-12T00:47:41Z</published><updated> 2023-09-12T00:47:43Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>CNBC has another excerpt from Walter Isaacson&#39;s <em>Elon Musk</em> , this one telling the tale of Musk and his cousins moving thousands of servers from a data center in Sacramento to another in Portland:</p><blockquote><p> “You&#39;ll have to hire a contractor to lift the floor panels,” Alex said. “They need to be lifted with suction cups.” Another set of contractors, he said, would then have to go underneath the floor panels and disconnect the electric cables and seismic rods.</p><p> Musk turned to his security guard and asked to borrow his pocket knife. Using it, he was able to lift one of the air vents in the floor, which allowed him to pry open the floor panels. He then crawled under the server floor himself, used the knife to jimmy open an electrical cabinet, pulled the server plugs, and waited to see what happened. Nothing exploded. The server was ready to be moved.</p><p> “Well that doesn&#39;t seem super hard,” he said as Alex the Uzbek and the rest of the gang stared. Musk was totally jazzed by this point. It was, he said with a loud laugh, like a remake of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> , Sacramento edition.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s all a bunch of yucks until it turns to yikes:</p><blockquote><p> The servers had user data on them, and James did not initially realize that, for privacy reasons, they were supposed to be wiped clean before being moved. “By the time we learned this, the servers had already been unplugged and rolled out, so there was no way we would roll them back, plug them in, and then wipe them,” he says. Plus, the wiping software wasn&#39;t working. “Fuck, what do we do?”他问。 Elon recommended that they lock the trucks and track them.</p><p> So James sent someone to Home Depot to buy big padlocks, and they sent the combination codes on a spreadsheet to Portland so the trucks could be opened there. “I can&#39;t believe it worked,” James says. “They all made it to Portland safely.”</p></blockquote><p> A profound sense of urgency is beneficial to a leader, up to a point. Despite CNBC&#39;s framing, Musk clearly goes way past that point. This entire endeavor was absurdly and unnecessarily reckless. In addition to the privacy violations, yanking these servers out of Sacramento, against the direct advice of Twitter&#39;s infrastructure team, directly led to months of instability for users.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘At Least the Word ‘Maniacal’ Fits’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Qualcomm Announces Renewed Deal With Apple for 5G Modems </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40226</id><published> 2023-09-11T15:54:05Z</published><updated> 2023-09-11T20:10:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ian King and Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. is extending an agreement to get modem semiconductors from Qualcomm Inc. for three more years, a sign that its ambitious effort to design the chips in-house is taking longer than expected. Qualcomm shares surged on the news.</p><p> The new pact will cover “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026,” Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies&#39; agreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone — due on Tuesday — was expected to be one of the last to rely on the Qualcomm modem chip. […]</p><p> “This agreement reinforces Qualcomm&#39;s track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products,” the San Diego-based chipmaker said. Though the financial terms of the new deal weren&#39;t disclosed, Qualcomm said it was similar to the previous arrangement signed in 2019.</p></blockquote><p> Funny how they announced this today, and even funnier that there&#39;s no quote from anyone at Apple.

<p>Yoko Kubota, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-bans-iphone-use-for-government-officials-at-work-635fe2f8">reporting from Beijing for The Wall Street Journal</a> Wednesday ( <a href="https://apple.news/A01gybx6UQReBj5eQUppe8g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> China ordered officials at central government agencies not to use Apple&#39;s iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p> In recent weeks, staff were given the instructions by their superiors in workplace chat groups or meetings, the people said. The directive is the latest step in Beijing&#39;s campaign to cut reliance on foreign technology and enhance cybersecurity, and comes as China seeks to limit flows of sensitive information outside of China&#39;s borders. The move by Beijing could have a chilling effect for foreign brands in China, including Apple. Apple dominates the high-end smartphone market in the country and counts China as one of its biggest markets, relying on it for about 19% of its overall revenue.</p></blockquote><p> Jenny Leonard and Debby Wu, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/china-plans-to-expand-iphone-ban-to-some-state-backed-firms-in-blow-to-apple">reporting for Bloomberg</a> <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-10"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-10">1</a></sup> Thursday:</p><blockquote><p> China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.</p><p> Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-06/china-bans-iphone-use-at-central-government-agencies-wsj-says">report</a> from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.</p></blockquote><p> [ <strong>Inside Baseball Interpolation:</strong> I have often mentioned here that Bloomberg, as a news organization, is uniquely fanatical about scoops — being the first to break news, and in particular, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg">market-moving news</a> . And they expect credit for their scoops when the news is re-reported elsewhere. So trust me, it pains them to credit the Journal for this scoop. But here&#39;s where the Bloomberg institutional dickheadedness is revealed: check out the link for the word “report” in the blockquote above. <em>Hint:</em> It doesn&#39;t link to, you know, the Wall Street Journal story that broke the news.]</p><blockquote><p> If Beijing goes ahead, the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing&#39;s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry.</p></blockquote><p> This gets to the nut of my intense curiosity regarding this edict. How much of it is nationalism — the CCP turning up the dial on the inherently jingoist mindset of a police state — and how much of it, if any, is about the fact that iPhones are secure, and their security is outside the reach of the CCP? The Chinese government surely wants to surveil what government employees do on their phones, and iPhones make that harder.</p><p> Lastly, where does Apple&#39;s unique relationship with the Chinese government play into this? Apple remains dependent upon China for manufacturing, the iPhone in particular. They <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/india-expected-to-assemble-1-in-10-iphone-15-models-in-2023/">make some iPhones elsewhere</a> , but the overwhelming majority are assembled in China, and there&#39;s no other supply chain on earth that can replace it today. That&#39;s a terrible starting point for any negotiation. But: China gets a lot from Apple. Over the course of my lifetime, China has been fighting to change the perception of what “Made in China” stands for. It&#39;s always meant cheap. It used to also imply shoddy. Apple is the feather in China&#39;s cap. iPhones aren&#39;t just the nicest phones in the world — they&#39;re arguably the nicest and most complex mass-produced consumer products in any category. And they are made almost exclusively in China.</p><p> The Chinese government surely bristles at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-is-huaweis-new-smartphone-generating-so-much-buzz-2023-09-01/">the pariah status of Huawei globally</a> , but there&#39;s no plausible scenario where any Chinese company achieves the sort of prestige Apple has. Huawei phones, at <em>best</em> , are third-rate, and everyone knows it, including everyone in China. <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-10"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-10">2</a></sup> If China maintains its symbiotic relationship with Apple, China will remain firmly associated with the most prestigious technology brand in the world. If not, and Apple migrates its primary manufacturing elsewhere, China again drops to being associated only with second- and third-rate products. Even worse, the best company — in that scenario — would have chosen to part with China. China gains enormous prestige from Apple; Apple takes a reputational <em>hit</em> from its reliance upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre">brutal</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/crackdown-in-xinjiang">human-rights-violating</a> communist dictatorship.</p><p> Perhaps China feels free to antagonize Apple out of the belief that Apple <em>cannot</em> eliminate its dependence upon Chinese manufacturing. But even if that&#39;s true, the message to other companies (say, carmakers) eyeing a move to Chinese assembly would be this: once you grow dependent upon China we&#39;ll screw you like we screwed Apple. China&#39;s intended message to the world isn&#39;t merely that they&#39;re the most capable nation for manufacturing, it&#39;s that they&#39;re also a trustworthy and dependable partner.</p><p> This sandbagging of Apple regarding iPhone usage by government employees says the opposite: that China cannot be trusted as a partner.</p><p> So here&#39;s how I tally the detente. If Apple can ease away from its dependence upon China for manufacturing, they <em>might</em> . But the risk is that doing so will upset the Xi Jinping regime and Apple will suffer in consumer product sales within China. (Perhaps that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing now?)</p><p> If Apple does ease away from China, though, who can China replace them with? Who could they tout as a world-class technology company that relies upon China for manufacturing? Second place is so far behind Apple you can&#39;t see it.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-10"><p> Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack">The Big Hack</a> ” in October 2018 — a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China&#39;s intelligence services.

By all appearances “The Big Hack” was complete bullshit. Yet Bloomberg has issued no correction or retraction, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con">their only ostensibly substantial follow-up</a> contained not one shred of evidence to back up their allegations. Bloomberg seemingly hopes we&#39;ll all just forget about it. I say we do not just forget about it.

A larger battery does not mean longer battery life. And most ridiculously, “higher-resolution cameras” not only doesn&#39;t mean “better cameras”, there are like zero people on the planet, including Joe Huawei himself, who believes any Huawei phone has cameras that are competitive with those in iPhones. “Resolution” is the last refuge of camera scoundrels. For Chinese consumers Huawei offers two things over an iPhone: it&#39;s a Chinese company, and the phones are cheaper. Apple should worry about the Chinese government. Apple has nothing to worry about from Huawei. <a href="#fnr2-2023-09-10"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote  in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The China-Apple Cold War Heats Up</title></entry><entry><title> 3D Printing Precision Titanium Components</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxKI4XBwBjU" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/09/3d-titanium-printing" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40223</id><published> 2023-09-09T21:54:47Z</published><updated> 2023-09-09T21:55:46Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p> The Indiana Pi Bill is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the Indiana General Assembly, one of the most notorious attempts to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, although it does imply various incorrect values of the mathematical constant π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by a physician who was an amateur mathematician, never became law due to the intervention of Prof. CA Waldo of Purdue University, who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210515024706/http://www.math.purdue.edu/people/bio/egoins/Indiana%20Pi%20Bill.html">Here&#39;s a good summary</a> (from modern day Purdue professor Edray Goins) of how this kook Edwin Goodwin arrived at π = 3.2.</p><p> I was reminded of this laughable legislation <sup>*</sup> by a friend commenting on the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/uk-encryption-win">UK abandoning its foolhardy attempt</a> to mandate the inspection of impossible-to-inspect end-to-end messaging. E2EE communication cannot be “scanned” for child pornography while remaining secure for all other purposes, but it would be nice if it could. Pi is not 3.2 and a circle cannot be squared, but it would nice if it were so. The UK&#39;s legislation is every bit as much ignorant wishful thinking as Indiana&#39;s was over a century ago.</p><p> That Indiana bill was not defeated, however — it was apparently merely shelved. The UK, likewise, has not repealed the law granting them the power to effectively ban end-to-end encryption — they&#39;ve merely declared that they will not use it — yet. That&#39;s dangerous. This law should be rescinded, not ignored.</p><p> <small>* <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/mode/1up">From Waldo&#39;s own account of the saga</a> comes this gem of a quote (written in the third person), regarding an offer to be introduced to Goodwin: “A member then showed the writer a copy of the bill just passed and asked him if he would like an introduction to the learned doctor, its author. He declined the courtesy with thanks remarking that he was acquainted with as many crazy people as he cared to know.”</small><p> Amen, Dr. Waldo.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Indiana Pi Bill’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/indiana-pi-bill">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Twitter/X&#39;s Descent Into an Antisemitic Cesspool </title><link href="https://twitter.com/David_Leavitt/status/1699494318078136786" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/twitter-antisemetic-cesspool" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40221</id><published> 2023-09-06T23:29:17Z</published><updated> 2023-09-07T06:01:53Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Lane Brown, writing for Vulture:</p><blockquote><p> But despite Rotten Tomatoes&#39;s reputed importance, it&#39;s worth a reminder: Its math stinks. Scores are calculated by classifying each review as either positive or negative and then dividing the number of positives by the total. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about">That&#39;s the whole formula</a> . Every review carries the same weight whether it runs in a major newspaper or a Substack with a dozen subscribers.</p><p> If a review straddles positive and negative, too bad. “I read some reviews of my own films where the writer might say that he doesn&#39;t think that I pull something off, but, boy, is it interesting in the way that I don&#39;t pull it off,” says Schrader, a former critic. “To me, that&#39;s a good review, but it would count as negative on Rotten Tomatoes.” [...]</p><p> Another problem — and where the trickery often begins — is that Rotten Tomatoes scores are posted after a movie receives only a handful of reviews, sometimes as few as five, even if those reviews may be an unrepresentative sample. This is sort of like a cable-news network declaring an Election Night winner after a single county reports its results. But studios see it as a feature, since, with a little elbow grease, they can sometimes fool people into believing a movie is better than it is.</p></blockquote><p> Brown also uncovers implicit payola, with a Hollywood PR firm paying small-time critics tracked by Rotten Tomatoes $50 (fifty measly bucks!) for positive reviews. My whole family has been growing ever more skeptical of Rotten Tomatoes scores for years, but we reached a breaking point earlier this year when we rented <em>M3gan</em> , which we all found to be a shitty movie, but <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan">scored a 93 from Rotten Tomatoes</a> .

<p>Robert von Bahr, founder of BIS Records:</p><blockquote><p> A few days ago BIS Records turned 50 years old and I am immensely proud of what our small team of people has accomplished during this half-century. BIS&#39;s specialty, while paying our dues to the core repertoire, has been to nurture young classical artists and interesting living composers and to safeguard the musical treasure that we all represent long into the future. It is to that end that, after much careful consideration, and having just turned 80, I am excited to announce the rather momentous news that we have made the decision to become part of the Apple family.</p><p> We thought long and hard on how to maintain and build upon our prestigious history and looked for a partner who would further our mission, as well as an increased global platform to bring classical music to new audiences all over the world. Apple, with its own storied history of innovation and love of music, is the ideal home to usher in the next era of classical and has shown true commitment towards building a future in which classical music and technology work in harmony. It is my vision and my sincerest dream that we are all a part of this future.</p></blockquote><p> Now <em>this</em> is an Apple-style acquisition.

<p>Cristina Criddle, Anna Gross, and John Aglionby, reporting from London for The Financial Times ( <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenRightsGroup/status/1699450898680873364">paywall-circumventing Twitter link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The UK government has conceded it will not use controversial powers in the online safety bill to scan messaging apps for harmful content until it is “technically feasible” to do so, postponing measures that critics say threaten users&#39; privacy.</p><p> In a statement to the House of Lords on Wednesday afternoon, junior arts and heritage minister Lord Stephen Parkinson sought to mark an eleventh-hour effort to end a stand-off with tech companies, including WhatsApp, that have threatened to pull their services from the UK over what they claimed was an intolerable threat to millions of users&#39; privacy and security.</p><p> Parkinson said that Ofcom, the tech regulator, would only require companies to scan their networks when a technology is developed that is capable of doing so. Many security experts believe it could be years before any such technology is developed, if ever.</p></blockquote><p> <em>No, Thursday&#39;s out. How about never — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/the-story-of-how-about-never">is never good for you</a> ?</em></p><blockquote><p> WhatsApp, owned by Facebook&#39;s parent Meta, and Signal, another popular encrypted messaging app, are among those that have threatened to exit the UK market should they be ordered to weaken encryption, a widely used security technology that allows only the sender and recipient of messages to view a message&#39;s contents. [...]</p><p> Officials have privately acknowledged to tech companies that there is no current technology able to scan end-to-end encrypted messages that would not also undermine users&#39; privacy, according to several people briefed on the government&#39;s thinking.</p></blockquote><p> This isn&#39;t the worst reporting on encryption and lawmakers&#39; fantasies about “backdoors only accessible by the good guys”, but it&#39;s fundamentally misleading. End-to-end encryption&#39;s meaning is right there in its name. There&#39;s no dial that can be adjusted from “weak” to “strong”. There&#39;s no option for content inspection between end points. It&#39;s not about choosing not to allow eavesdroppers, it&#39;s about implementing protocols where it&#39;s technically impossible to inspect content between sender and receiver.</p><p> The actual math is far more complex, but ultimately this boils down to the UK acknowledging that 2 + 2 can only equal 4.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘U.K. Abandons, for Now, Legislation That Would Have Banned End-to-End Encryption’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/uk-encryption-win">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Rolling Stones: &#39;Angry&#39;</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mEC54eTuGw" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v15" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/stones-angry" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40217</id><published> 2023-09-06T16:53:27Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T16:53:28Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Horace Dediu, writing at the newly refreshed Asymco:</p><blockquote><p> So the picture becomes clearer. The iPhone customer is <em>7.4 times</em> more valuable than the Android customer. This is more impressive than the 4× rule I had 10 years ago. The reasons are mainly that my anecdotes were from developers who sold products in the US or EU whereas expansion of smartphones to 7 billion global users has drawn in more lower spending customers.</p><p> But Apple&#39;s base has also grown to over 1 billion users (650 million store users). This highlights that Apple has effectively grown <em>and</em> discriminated customers effectively. It obtained not just 1 billion customers but <em>the best</em> 1 billion customers.</p><p> How to discriminate effectively is the holy grail of marketing. The naïve approach is to keep prices high. But that usually only results in a “luxury” branding and a small base that tends not to grow. The alternative “premium” approach is to offer functionality and multiple tiers and distribution options and financing and merchandising. There is no simple formula.</p></blockquote><p> I really enjoyed this piece, but I will quibble with “There is no simple formula”. It&#39;s the <em>execution</em> that is difficult and complex. But at a high level the formula Apple has applied to make the iPhone (and iPad) the unprecedented success that they are is remarkably simple.</p><p> First, make something people care deeply about. Computers are the biggest advance in human society since the industrial revolution; <em>revolution</em> is a strong word but it applied then and applies again today. People care about their computers and what they do on their computers very much, and they care most about the most personal of personal computers: their phones. They use them for communication, photography, entertainment (music and video), games, and more. They carry them almost everywhere they go, all day every day, and sleep next to them.</p><p> Second, make the best version of that thing people care deeply about. The people who care the most will perceive the superiority of your product, and gladly — not begrudgingly — pay a premium for it.</p><p> Third, keep iterating, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">tirelessly and continuously</a> , to improve that product year after year. Focus on aspects that cannot be copied or imitated. In the iPhone&#39;s case, those are things such as custom chips, superior hardware components and manufacturing techniques, software frameworks <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-deep-history-of-your-apps-steve-jobs-nextstep-and-early-object-oriented-programming/">decades</a> in the making, a culture that prioritizes great design, and an ever-expanding ecosystem that keeps customers in the flock <em>by making them happy</em> . Build a luxury resort they don&#39;t want to leave, not a prison they can&#39;t leave.</p><p> Don&#39;t prioritize being first or being cheapest. Prioritize being the best. That&#39;s a simple strategy. It&#39;s the execution that&#39;s hard as hell.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Horace Dediu: ‘The Value of a Customer’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/dediu-value-of-a-customer">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Should Apple Cease Advertising on Twitter? </title><link href="https://technovia.co.uk/2023/09/04/its-long-past.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v13" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40215</id><published> 2023-09-05T20:39:37Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T20:39:38Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ian Betteridge:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is very good at taking a stand when it&#39;s easy. It refused to carry various small right-wing social platforms on its App Store, because the content moderation policies weren&#39;t up to scratch. Meanwhile, Twitter gets a pass despite having no practical control over hate speech and an owner who actively encourages it.</p><p> Should we be considering boycotting Apple and other companies that advertise on Twitter? Let&#39;s frame that another way: if you found out that a company was actively funding hate speech, would you want to buy products from them?</p><p> I know I wouldn&#39;t.</p></blockquote><p> Betteridge is without question correct that Apple is in a difficult position here. If you think it would be easy, recall last year, when Apple had drawn Musk&#39;s ire over the App Store&#39;s policies. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/30/cook-musk-apple-park">As I wrote then</a> , “Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.”</p><p> But it&#39;s hard to imagine any other ad venue — website, billboard, magazine, TV channel — where Apple would run ads that run alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/k_pendergrast/status/1697385443040653479">ads like this one</a> . No need for a statement. Just cease running ads on Twitter/X, and stop paying for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/29/hashmoji-iphone-15-apple-event/">these promotional “hashflags”</a> .

<p>Rebecca Bellan, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> In the newest uproar you might have missed, Elon Musk says X, formerly Twitter, will file a defamation lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League. Musk accused the ADL, an organization that works to combat antisemitism, extremism and bigotry, of falsely accusing him and X of being antisemitic.</p><p> “To clear our platform&#39;s name on the matter of anti-Semitism, it looks like we have no choice but to file a defamation lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League … oh the irony!” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698828606598734225">tweeted</a> the billionaire celebrity on Monday.</p><p> Musk also blamed the ADL for X&#39;s falling US advertising revenue. “Our US advertising revenue is still down 60%, primarily due to pressure on advertisers by @ADL (that&#39;s what advertisers tell us), so they almost succeeded in killing X/Twitter!” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698755938541330907">said Musk</a> .</p><p> Musk started off this latest tirade by claiming to be pro-free speech, but “against anti-Semitism of any kind.”</p></blockquote><p> Musk claims he&#39;s going to do all sorts of crazy shit. Sometimes he actually goes through with it, like the time he said he was going to buy Twitter and take it private. Most of the time, though, he doesn&#39;t. We need to stop reporting on what he says and focus mostly on what he does. Just two weeks ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">I began using this headline play on the proverbial Little Boy Who Cried Wolf</a> when Musk declared that Twitter/X was going to get rid of the block feature. He might still go through with that threat, but it hasn&#39;t happened, and I suspect it won&#39;t.</p><p> So why am I even linking to this threat against the ADL? Because what has already happened is odious and noteworthy. A weekend-long trending “BanTheADL” hashtag that not only wasn&#39;t suppressed, but was bolstered by Musk himself. Now this “ <em>It&#39;s all the Jews&#39; fault</em> ” excuse in the form of the lawsuit threat — it doesn&#39;t really matter if Musk follows through and sues (it&#39;d be a nonsensical suit), the damage is that Twitter&#39;s most popular user — who happens to own it — is openly courting antisemites.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Little Musk Who Cries ‘Wolf’ Daily Now Claims Twitter/X Is Going to Sue the Anti-Defamation League’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;The MacOS App Icon Book&#39; by Michael Flarup </title><link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-macos-app-icon-book" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v11" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40213</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:06:46Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T19:06:47Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>New from the dynamic duo at Studio Neat: Keen, a $95 box cutter.</p><p> Yes, a box cutter/utility knife that costs about $100. A $100 tool to replace the sort of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lnchett-12-Pack-Retractable-Cardboard-Mechanism/dp/B07DXTP9M9/?tag=df-amzn-20">disposable thing</a> that costs like a $1 a pop. Until about a year ago, those disposable plastic jobbies were what I used, and I kept losing them. About a year ago, after losing track of the last one in my office, it occurred to me that I lose them because I don&#39;t care about them. I already owned a nice keychain-sized pocket knife from The James Brand, which I love, so I bought <a href="https://thejamesbrand.com/products/the-palmer">the Palmer</a> , their $59 box cutter. 11 months later and I haven&#39;t misplaced it once. And I&#39;m happier for owning it: it&#39;s way nicer to use than any disposable I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p> A few weeks ago, though, my pals at Studio Neat sent me a pre-production Keen. I prefer it to the Palmer in every single regard. First, it&#39;s thinner and smaller, but in no way <em>too</em> small. Second, it&#39;s easier to change the blade. But most importantly, the Keen offers a completely original design for opening and closing the blade: a spring-loaded slider. It&#39;s so different from any box cutter design I&#39;ve ever seen that I wondered if I&#39;d even like it at all, let alone prefer it, because it does not lock into place. Turns out though I <em>much</em> prefer it. It feels both more convenient and safer, because it&#39;s impossible to leave the blade extended while you aren&#39;t holding it. And when released, it springs back so quickly that if you drop it, the blade will retract by the time it lands.</p><p> Pens are so cheap you can get them free at most bank counters, but many people who care spend more to get a really nice one. (Studio Neat, in fact, has you covered there as well, if you&#39;re interested, with their <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone">Mark One</a> and <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/marktwo">Mark Two</a> . Me personally, I remain devoted to the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/6387">$1.75 Zebra Sarasa</a> .) A box cutter is no different. Given how many packages I receive each and every week of the year, it&#39;s one of my most-used tools. So why not buy the best? The Kickstarter is already fully-funded, but the eventual retail price will be around $25 higher than the Kickstarter price.</p><p>也可以看看：</p><ul><li><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5bFsyRSTp4">Chase Reeves made a fun little YouTube video about the Keen</a> .</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C3J93DWH/?tag=df-amzn-20">These ceramic utility razor blades</a> are sharper than steel ones, supposedly last longer, and work especially well with the Keen in that they aren&#39;t attracted by the Keen&#39;s magnetic closure.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Studio Neat’s Keen: The World’s Best Box Cutter’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/studio-neat-keen">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://ohdear.app/?via=daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0z" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/09/oh_dear" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40211</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-09-04T21:46:16Z</published><updated> 2023-09-10T19:55:09Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The Iconfactory:</p><blockquote><p> All of us here at the Iconfactory love the classic video games we played in our youth. Many hours were spent in front of titles like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol">Moon Patrol</a> , and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)">Battlezone</a> , as well as cherished handheld electronic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/N14UCRZsN3U?si=ewAgv7QK9J9RWeD_">Mattel Football</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/NI4yTsvauTs?si=S7RtQUvxLD2FVEUG">Simon</a> , and <a href="https://youtu.be/m-OkKHxH1xo?si=Voc2r1s8taEHx_v7">Merlin</a> . Ollie&#39;s Arcade recaptures a little bit of this magic and gives players a chance to turn their iPhone or iPad into a retro gaming experience.</p><p> Two of the games in Ollie&#39;s Arcade — Ollie Soars and Tranquility Touchdown — were inspired by simple Easter eggs in <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2023/01/twitterrific-end-of-an-era/">Twitterrific</a> , our beloved Twitter app. We polished Tranquility Touchdown, completely revamped Ollie Soars, and added an all-new third game — our own take on the classic Snake. All of Ollie&#39;s mini-games are easy to learn and designed to be accessible for everyone. You can even play with your favorite game controller or via wireless keyboard.</p></blockquote><p> Ollie Soars is free of charge; the other two games are just $2 each. What a novel idea: pay once, play them forever. Tranquility Touchdown gets so many little details from the vector graphics arcade era right.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ollie’s Arcade’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/ollies-arcade">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Pleading the Fifth&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/08/31/ep-384" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/the-talk-show-384" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40208</id><published> 2023-09-03T22:53:40Z</published><updated> 2023-09-03T22:53:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-thunderbolt-cable/">Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple may offer a USB-C data transfer accessory cable for iPhone 15 Pro models that is capable of Thunderbolt or USB4 speeds of up to 40Gbps. That is <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1694893349705240598">the latest claim made by Kosutami</a> , who posted details of the cable on Twitter (now X). According to the leaker, the length of the cable is 0.8 meters, which is shorter than <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN713AM/A/thunderbolt-4-pro-cable-18-m">Apple&#39;s existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a> (1.8m), and it is said to support charging up to 150W. Apple will allegedly sell the cable separately.</p></blockquote><p> Lest you think it nickel-and-dime-y for Apple to sell a Thunderbolt 4 cable separately, note that Thunderbolt 4 cables are <em>expensive</em> . <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/thunderbolt-cable">Apple currently sells two</a> : the 1.8m one costs $129, and the 3m one costs $159. I bought a 0.8m one made by Razor last year, with very similar feel and quality to Apple&#39;s, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TGBF6DK/?tag=df-amzn-20">that Amazon currently sells for $46</a> . (That&#39;s a make-me-rich affiliate link, if you&#39;re in the market for a Thunderbolt 4 cable.) A 1m Thunderbolt cable from Monoprice (rubber, not braided) <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=44117">costs $30</a> . Apple&#39;s own 0.8m Thunderbolt 3 cable costs $39. I&#39;m guessing this new 0.8m Thunderbolt 4 cable from Apple will cost $99. It&#39;d be downright silly for Apple to include an expensive (and thick, stiff, and short) cable like that with every iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p> The reason to even offer such a cable, and to offer Thunderbolt 4 performance on the phones, is for data transfer, specifically video. The single biggest frustration regarding iPhones sticking with Lightning until this year is that 4K video files are <em>very</em> large, but USB 2.0 data transfer is <em>very</em> slow. iPhones have been capable of shooting 4K video since the 6S models in 2015, and as their image quality has improved each year, the data transfer limitations of Lightning has seemed more and more incongruous. <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-29">1</a></sup></p><p> I ran into this twice, when we used iPhones to shoot the COVID-era episodes of The Talk Show Remote From WWDC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg9F1Qjv3iU&amp;t=6s">in 2020</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SzbucgATjA">and 2021</a> . The footage looked great, but it took hours to transfer it off the phones. Heretofore, iPhones have offered pro-quality video cameras limited to decidedly consumer-level data transfer rates.</p><p> Speaking of “pro”, though, faster data transfer speeds might literally be capital-P Pro features this year. Hardwick continues:</p><blockquote><p> Speculation therefore remains rife about the USB-C port capabilities of the iPhone 15 lineup, and nothing is certain beyond the switch from Lightning. Rumors suggest the cables supplied in iPhone 15 boxes are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-usb-c-cable-usb2-transfer-speeds/">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> at a rate of 480 MBps, which is the same as Lightning.</p><p> In contrast, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to be supplied with cables capable of USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 transfer speeds, as per Kuo&#39;s original claim. Images from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/some-iphone-15-models-feature-thunderbolt-speeds/">ChargerLab</a> suggest that some iPhone 15 models will include a Thunderbolt/USB 4 retimer chip, seemingly confirming the rumor of higher-speed data transfer for the Pro models.</p><p> Each iPhone 15 will include a braided USB-C charging cable in the box that is thicker (ie more durable) and 50% longer than the Lightning cable that comes with current iPhone models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/">according to reports</a> . The cables are also rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">color-matched</a> to possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/five-iphone-15-color-options-to-expect/">new iPhone colors</a> , coming in at least black, white, yellow, blue, and orange.</p></blockquote><p> Even most Pro-model iPhone buyers never transfer data over a cable, so differentiating the iPhone 15 Pro models from the non-pro ones in this way feels fair. Including color-matched braided cables with all new models would be a nice touch (and lines up with other recent products, like the M1 iMacs and M2 MacBook Airs, that ship with color-matched braided cables). But the fact that some of these phones (the non-pro ones) might support only USB 2 speeds (480 Mbps), while others (the Pro models) will support up to Thunderbolt 4 (40 Gbps — roughly 80× faster), yet all the ports and cable connectors will look the same to the naked eye, only goes to show just how confusing “USB-C” is. Glenn Fleishman&#39;s headline from 2021 remains as apt as ever: “ <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/12/03/usbefuddled-untangling-the-rats-nest-of-usb-c-standards-and-cables/">USBefuddled: Untangling the Rat&#39;s Nest of USB-C Standards and Cables</a> ”.</p><hr /><p> While I&#39;m writing about the switch to USB-C, let me make a prediction how this will be received when it&#39;s officially announced in two weeks. The small number of filmmakers who shoot using iPhones (small compared to the aggregate number of iPhone users overall) will rejoice. The larger number of nerds, and even semi-nerds, who travel with multiple computing devices and just want USB-C charging connectors on all them will be happy. But the vast silent majority of normal iPhone users? I think there&#39;s going to be a backlash that most USB-C proponents don&#39;t see coming, premised on accusations that this switch is a money grab from Apple to get people to replace all their Lightning cables with new <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/usb-c-cable?src=globalnav">$30 USB-C cables from the Apple Store</a> .</p><p> <em>You</em> , dear reader, of course know that USB-C is an industry standard and you can buy <a href="https://www.anker.com/collections/usb-c?ref=naviMenu">high-quality cables</a> from <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/category/cables/usb-&amp;-lightning-cables/usb-c-cables">stores</a> other than Apple. I don&#39;t think everyone knows that. And even those who will buy their new USB-C charging cables from companies other than Apple are likely to grouse about the need to buy new cables at all.</p><p> When Apple switched from the 30-pin iPod connector to Lightning with the iPhone 5 in 2012, there was a <em>lot</em> of grousing. And that was a port switch where you could easily <em>see</em> how much better the new one was. (The old 30-pin connector and port really do look absurd to modern eyes.) At a glance USB-C doesn&#39;t look any better than and barely different from Lightning. My gut feeling is that not much has changed since 2012 on the “new iPhone connector” front, other than the fact that there are, quite literally, over a billion more iPhone users today than then, and thus perhaps <em>billions</em> of extant Lightning cables in use. Typical users put more value on being able to just keep using the old cables (and chargers) they already have <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-29">2</a></sup> — at their bedsides, in their kitchens, on their desks, in their cars, in their backpacks and purses — than reducing the number of different <em>types</em> of cables they need in their lives.</p><p> I don&#39;t know how many people are going to be irritated, if not downright angry, about this switch, but it&#39;s going to be a <em>lot</em> more people <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-29">3</a></sup> than most “ <em>the iPhone should have already switched to USB-C</em> ” proponents expect. Me, I&#39;ll gladly take the vastly-improved data transfer speeds. But I won&#39;t be the one answering the phone at 1-800-MY-APPLE.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-29"><p> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2391101/what-it-was-like-filming-unsane-on-an-iphone-according-to-the-cast">Steven Soderbergh shot the feature film <em>Unsane</em> using iPhone 7&#39;s in 2017</a> .

I think this is the single biggest reason Apple has waited so long to switch the iPhone to USB-C. (The iPad Pros switched from Lightning five years ago.) I think they wanted to introduce MagSafe first, let people accumulate a few MagSafe cables in the places where they charge their iPhones, and then switch from Lightning to USB-C. Three years of iPhones (12, 13, 14) have already had MagSafe, so that&#39;s about an average upgrade cycle for most users. But anecdotally, the normals in my family don&#39;t use MagSafe, they use Lightning, probably because the cables are cheaper. <a href="#fnr2-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-08-29"><p> And a lot more clickbait-y “Look What Apple Is Forcing iPhone Users to Buy” headlines. <a href="#fnr3-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Idle Speculation on the Widely-Assumed Switch to USB-C Ports on the Upcoming iPhones 15</title></entry><entry><title> Apple Announces &#39;Wonderlust&#39; Event on Tuesday 12 September </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/29/apple-wonderlust" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40203</id><published> 2023-08-29T17:00:02Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T17:37:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>I can&#39;t explain it, but while most of the remaining sponsorship weeks for the year are sold, three of the next four are open — <s>including this very week</s> . All months are good months, but September is a particularly busy month covering Apple, traditionally.

And if you&#39;re willing and able to jump on this very week&#39;s opening, I&#39;m sure we can work out a deal.</p><p> In related news, there are more openings than usual on the sponsorship schedule for The Talk Show for the next quarter.

<p>Apple&#39;s Developer News site has a nice interview with three indie developers who&#39;ve visited the Vision Pro labs, including Michael Simmons from <a href="https://flexibits.com/">Flexibits</a> and David “Underscore” Smith, of <a href="https://www.david-smith.org/apps/">Widgetsmith</a> fame:</p><blockquote><p> For his part, Simmons saw Fantastical work right out of the box. He describes the labs as “a proving ground” for future explorations and a chance to push software beyond its current bounds. “A bordered screen can be limiting. Sure, you can scroll, or have multiple monitors, but generally speaking, you&#39;re limited to the edges,” he says. “Experiencing spatial computing not only validated the designs we&#39;d been thinking about — it helped us start thinking not just about left to right or up and down, but beyond borders at all.”</p></blockquote><p> Simmons&#39;s remarks echo my biggest takeaway from my demo experience: the lack of a “frame” encompassing windows.</p><blockquote><p> And as not just CEO but the lead product designer (and the guy who “still comes up with all these crazy ideas”), he came away from the labs with a fresh batch of spatial thoughts. “Can people look at a whole week spatially? Can people compare their current day to the following week? If a day is less busy, can people make that day wider? And then, what if like you have the whole week wrap around you in 360 degrees?” he says. “I could probably — not kidding — talk for two hours about this.”</p></blockquote><p> Two hours, you say? <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/04/30/ep-345">I know a guy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inside the Apple Vision Pro Developer Labs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/inside-vision-developer-labs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface </title><link href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40200</id><published> 2023-08-28T18:45:16Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T21:58:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Remember <em>last</em> year at WWDC, when Apple previewed the next generation of CarPlay, with support for screens that span the entire dashboard? Here&#39;s a MotorTrend report on the 2024 Porsche Cayenne SUV. <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay?slide=2">Slide 2</a> shows a CarPlay interface that I had first wrongly presumed spans the entire dashboard, but in fact does not.</p><p> <strong>Update 1:</strong> A few readers have chimed in to suggest this is <em>not</em> next-gen CarPlay 2, it&#39;s just extended use of CarPlay 1. It&#39;s definitely improved, but it is not the new stuff Apple previewed last June. My question: If this is <em>not</em> CarPlay 2, when, if ever, will we actually see a carmaker announce CarPlay 2 support? ( <em>Voice from the cheap seats: “When Apple makes their own car.”</em> )</p><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/28/hands-on-porsche-new-carplay-app/">Here&#39;s a hands-on report by Jameson Dow</a> for 9to5Mac from last month:</p><blockquote><p> We got a chance to test out some of its features on a 2024 Cayenne, and it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve felt an Apple-like experience from software made by a traditional automaker.</p><p> We&#39;re still waiting for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/03/new-carplay-interface-features-release/">next-gen CarPlay experience</a> which Apple announced last year, which promises greater integration with vehicle functions than today&#39;s version of CarPlay. In the meantime, though, Porsche has taken it upon itself to build its own app which offers the best of both worlds — a snappy, CarPlay-like user interface, along with control of some vehicle functions which were heretofore unavailable through Apple&#39;s software.</p></blockquote><p> So it might be the best CarPlay interface yet to ship in a car, but it&#39;s <em>not</em> the next-gen CarPlay announced by Apple last year. It&#39;s just CarPlay in the middle with other displays showing built-in stuff from Porsche based on <a href="https://www.porscheirvine.com/research/porsche-communication-management.htm">PCM</a> , their own in-house software platform.</p><p> <strong>Update 3:</strong> I&#39;ve now received feedback from three different readers who&#39;ve all said more or less the same thing: they paid extra for these extra screens in their Cayennes or Taycans, and the software experience on them is terrible. They regret paying for it. “A wasted useless screen” said one.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40199</id><published> 2023-08-28T17:28:39Z</published><updated> 2023-08-28T17:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.

<p>Clay Risen, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> John Warnock, a founder of Adobe Systems whose innovations in computer graphics, including the ubiquitous PDF, made possible today&#39;s visually rich digital experiences, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 82.</p><p> The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started in 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.</p></blockquote><p> It was just a month ago that pancreatic cancer took Kevin Mitnick, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip">I remarked</a> on how many people this specific cancer has taken of late.</p><blockquote><p> Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an arduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on either a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or a specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $10,000 and take up most of a room.</p><p> Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop printers themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer sent them. Adobe&#39;s first such protocol, PostScript, went into Apple&#39;s revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a few years it was the industry standard.</p><p> PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware companies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely unknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a program designed to render and read files in what it called a Portable Document Format, or PDF.</p></blockquote><p> PDF was an enormous breakthrough, and is more relevant today than ever. A true document format for the ages. But Adobe was well on its way before 1993. <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/02/20/a-blast-from-the-past-demos-of-adobe-photoshop-1-0/">Photoshop 1.0 launched in early 1990</a> . They began shipping their library of original <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5141">PostScript fonts and the essential Adobe Type Manager software</a> in 1989. And Illustrator 1.0 launched back in 1987, shipping with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjPTMfVBDh0">this video tour demonstrated by Warnock himself</a> .</p><p> Warnock and Geschke understood what Steve Jobs often preached: technology alone was not enough. PostScript was — <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html">and remains</a> ! — excellent technology. But it was not a product. The LaserWriter was a product. You hooked it up, went to File → Print in <em>any</em> application, and you got professional-grade 300 DPI output with no technical expertise necessary. It was as easy to print high-quality output on a LaserWriter as it was to print junk output on a slow, noisy dot-matrix printer. <em>That</em> was a product.</p><p> And Illustrator turned PostScript from a rather difficult but highly-capable programming language into a tool designed for use by artists. They didn&#39;t just make a nice code editor for writing PostScript. They created an app that presented a visual framework in which you directly manipulated shapes, lines, and curves as objects. Even expert Illustrator users were never exposed to PostScript directly. The Illustrator metaphor was a complete <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/eps-file.html">encapsulation</a> . That too was a product, and Illustrator remains an essential tool. If Warnock and Geschke had been satisfied merely with shipping great technology alone, Adobe Systems would be a nearly forgotten Silicon Valley footnote. Instead, they pushed to make Adobe the great tool-making product company we know today.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Adobe Co-Founder John Warnock Dies at 82’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/26/john-warnock-rip">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Threads Web App Launches </title><link href="https://www.threads.net/@threads/post/CwVVlQlOe53" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/threads-web" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40196</id><published> 2023-08-25T23:16:06Z</published><updated> 2023-08-26T19:25:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Started rolling out earlier this week, but by yesterday, I think it was available to everyone.

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> In the battle between iPad and Mac, I&#39;m a longtime member of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2016/02/ipad-vs-mac-im-on-team-both/">Team Both</a> — I use my Mac most of the day at my desk, but when I write elsewhere in the house or backyard, I switch to an iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard case. And that iPad (in a regular case) is my primary computing device when I&#39;m not in work mode.</p><p> I&#39;m not at all ready to declare the “use iPad to get work done” experiment dead. With the forthcoming release of iPadOS 17, Stage Manager has thrown in a bunch of improvements that suggest the iPad&#39;s progression to more functional status continues, albeit at a pace that&#39;s a bit too slow for my liking.</p><p> But here I sit at my mother&#39;s dining room table, typing on a MacBook Air. Something has changed in my approach to travel, and I&#39;m trying to understand just what it is and what it tells me about the trajectory of the iPad as a productivity tool.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve written <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air">at length</a> , multiple times, about my decidedly mixed feelings regarding the iPad — most stridently in January 2020, in a piece titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10">The iPad Awkwardly Turns 10</a> ”. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/stage+manager">Stage Manager</a> is the biggest change to the iPad interface since I wrote that, and its existence certainly helps on that “power user” front. (And Stage Manager sees some <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/with-ipados-17-stage-manager-is-finally-moving-in-the-right-direction/">nice improvements</a> in this year&#39;s iPadOS 17.) But for me personally, I continue to find that I&#39;m most productive when I spend my working time in front of my Mac. Gobs of people thrive using their iPads for writing and other creative endeavors. But I know I&#39;m best off, productivity-wise, using my iPad basically as a single-tasking consumption device for long-form reading and video watching.</p><p> The reason this topic remains evergreen is that I <em>want</em> to use my iPad more. There&#39;s something ineffable about it. It&#39;s a thrill when I use my iPad to do something that an iPad is actually best at. I honestly think I&#39;d be more productive if I owned no iPad at all, yet I keep trying to find ways to use it more.</p><p> So when I travel, it&#39;s never a question whether I&#39;ll pack my MacBook Pro. Even if I don&#39;t plan or want to work during a particular trip, the one-man-show nature of Daring Fireball means I feel that I need to be able to. (I was on a family vacation, preparing to head to dinner, when <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned">this news broke 12 years ago yesterday</a> .) The question is whether I even pack my iPad Pro at all, or just go it alone with iPhone and Mac. When I&#39;m packing, I generally wind up tossing the iPad in my bag, thinking I&#39;ll miss it if I don&#39;t. But when I do just leave the iPad at home, I don&#39;t miss it. It&#39;s confounding, though, because I&#39;m going on a trip next week and I bet I&#39;ll take my damn iPad.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Giving Up the iPad-Only Travel Dream’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/ipad-only-travel-dream">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Lends Support to California &#39;Right to Repair&#39; Bill </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/?guccounter=1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40194</id><published> 2023-08-25T00:50:13Z</published><updated> 2023-08-25T22:46:08Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Brian Heater, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> In a surprise move, Apple this week penned a letter to California state senator Susan Talamantes Eggman, voicing support for SB 244, a “right to repair” bill currently making its way through Sacramento&#39;s State Capitol building. [...] Apple has, of course, softened its stance on right to repair legislation in recent years, including last year&#39;s addition of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/iphone-14-and-m2-macs-get-added-to-apples-self-service-repair-program/">Self Service Repair program</a> . The offering, which was viewed by many as a preemptive measure against looming state and federal legislation, provides users with rental tools to repair iPhones and Macs at home.</p><p> In the letter, Apple expresses its support on the grounds of offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, without risking privacy or data issues. “Apple supports California&#39;s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “We create our products to last and, if they ever need to be repaired, Apple customers have a growing range of safe, high-quality repair options.”</p><p> This sort of backing from a specific manufacturer is unusual — particularly from Apple. It is thus far the only major manufacturer to express its support for the bill in this manner. These kinds of statements are generally made through industry consortiums, such as TechNet.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find Apple&#39;s support for this legislation surprising, but <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230823/p29#a230823p29">most people commenting on it do</a> .</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110943929863426254">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This is less of a pivot and more of just accepting reality.</p><p> Apple pushing aesthetics such as no seams in their phones over consumer benefits like being able to replace your phone&#39;s batteries has been deemed unacceptable by a number of governments including the EU.</p><p> Regulation is coming whether they like it or not, so they might as well get some positive PR for “supporting” the regulations.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/">Jason Koebler, writing at 404 Media</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple told a California legislator that it is formally supporting a right to repair bill in California, a landmark move that suggests big tech manufacturers understand they have lost the battle to monopolize repair, and need to allow consumers and independent repair shops to fix their own electronics.</p></blockquote><p> Koebler&#39;s use of “monopoly” hints at the assumption that authorized repairs are a profit center. That is true for some manufacturers in some industries. Koebler himself has copiously documented <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware">the saga with John Deere tractors</a> . All <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">the nonsense</a> inkjet printer makers go through to try to keep people from using third-party replacement ink cartridges is another. That&#39;s never been Apple&#39;s reason for opposing these laws. Apple&#39;s stance is more about control.</p><p> And I&#39;d argue that Obasanjo is missing the possibility that Apple actually thinks California&#39;s SB 244 is a well-written law. Would Apple prefer no such law at all? I think the answer is obviously yes. Providing all the necessary documentation, tools, and parts for every new device the company makes is a pain in Apple&#39;s corporate ass, and I think <em>that’s</em> why Apple resisted such legislation. From their perspective any such law is an unnecessary annoyance. But it&#39;s undeniably reasonable for there to be consumer protection laws, and if there are going to be Right to Repair laws that cover computing devices, those laws ought to be good ones. And the plain language of Apple&#39;s letter is that the company thinks this is a good one.</p><p> I highly doubt we&#39;re going to see any such letter from Apple to the EU endorsing their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/25/22996248/apple-sideloading-apps-store-third-party-eu-dma-requirement">Digital Markets Act</a> , the law that, among numerous other sweeping provisions, is poised to mandate sideloading on all phones. Apple continues to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/23/apple-opposes-eu-plans-to-make-common-charger-port-for-all-devices">oppose</a> the EU law requiring USB-C ports in all rechargeable devices, and that law is already passed. Apple has complied, begrudgingly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with the Netherlands&#39;s rather specific regulations regarding dating apps</a> and in-app payments — but they&#39;ve issued no praise for the law.</p><p> If Apple <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23925286-apple-support-sb-244">says they support California&#39;s SB 244</a> , it probably just means they actually support it.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Lends Support to California ‘Right to Repair’ Bill’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/kouvakas_uk_surveillance" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0f" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40191</id><published> 2023-08-24T01:20:01Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T01:20:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> What will actually happen, I believe, is that E2EE messaging platforms like WhatsApp (overwhelmingly popular in the UK), Signal, and iMessage *will stop working and be pulled from app stores in the UK*, full stop.

As a result, an operator of a messaging service wishing to introduce an advanced security feature would now have to first let the Home Office know in advance. Device manufacturers would likely also have to notify the government before making available important <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66256081">security updates</a> that fix known vulnerabilities and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/managing-deployed-devices/keeping-devices-and-software-up-to-date">keep devices secure</a> . Accordingly, the Secretary of State, upon receiving such an advance notice, could now request operators to, for instance, abstain from patching security gaps to allow the government to maintain access for surveillance purposes.</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly where I&#39;ve thought, for months, that the United Kingdom is heading with this legislation, but it&#39;s still shocking to see it described so starkly. It&#39;s like watching someone drive toward a cliff, and warning people, “ <em>Hey, I think these guys are driving right toward that cliff</em> ” — and yet I&#39;m still taken aback to see them drive off the cliff.</p><p> It&#39;s a complete fantasy that E2EE can be toggled like a light switch and still allow messages to be delivered. The end-to-end encryption isn&#39;t a sugar coating, some sort of extra layer of protection — it&#39;s fundamental to the messaging protocols themselves. It has to be, when you think about it. If it were possible for, say, Signal, to silently disable E2EE but still have messages go through, how could users ever trust the service? You could neither trust that what you were sending would be delivered securely, nor that what you received wasn&#39;t intercepted by an interloper. There&#39;s an explicit guarantee with all of these E2EE messaging platforms <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">that messages can <em>only</em> go through securely</a> . Removing E2EE wouldn&#39;t require some mere tweak to the protocols, it would require replacing the protocols entirely (with inherently insecure ones).</p><p> And the notion that security updates, for every user in the world, would need the approval of the UK Home Office just to make sure the patches weren&#39;t closing vulnerabilities that the government itself is exploiting — it boggles the mind. Even if the UK were the only country in the world to pass such a law, it would be madness, but what happens when other countries follow?</p><p> As I see it, the most likely outcome is that the UK passes the law, <em>thinking</em> that the grave concerns conveyed to them by the messaging services are overblown. That the platform providers are saying they <em>can&#39;t</em> comply but they really just mean they don&#39;t <em>want</em> to comply because it&#39;s just difficult, not impossible. And when it becomes law, the platforms will hand it off to the nerds, the nerds will nerd harder, and boom, the platforms will fall into compliance with this law. That&#39;s what they <em>think</em> will happen. What will actually happen, I believe, is that E2EE messaging platforms like WhatsApp (overwhelmingly popular in the UK), Signal, and iMessage <em>will stop working and be pulled from app stores in the UK</em> , full stop. The UK seems to think it&#39;s a bluff; I don&#39;t.</p><p> Perhaps the argument — as made by Kouvakas — that these changes would run afoul of international law will resonate with the UK in a way that technical arguments, thus far, have not.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;Changes to UK Surveillance Regime May Violate International Law&#39; </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_strategy_charts" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v05" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40181</id><published> 2023-08-18T03:59:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T21:52:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Disney was, and should remain, a serious engineering company. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> co-host Ben Thompson referenced <a href="https://kottke.org/15/06/walt-disneys-corporate-strategy-chart">this famous 1957 Disney org/strategy chart</a> in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/disneys-taylor-swift-era/">a (very good) Stratechery post</a> this week. I just now added a link to it in the footnote regarding company org charts in my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree">Disney/Apple piece</a> from yesterday, but it feels worth a post of its own.</p><p> At the center of the Disney business in the 1957 chart were theatrical films. Everything else — TV, music, magazines and comics, and the then-new Disneyland — funneled into and revolved around the theatrical films.</p><p> Lesser known is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthunterross/7973803710/in/pool-978039@N25/">this 1967 revision</a> . Or at least lesser known to me — I hadn&#39;t seen it before today. Walt Disney died in 1966, so this chart reflects the company as he left it. The differences from the 1957 chart that strike me:</p><ul><li><p> Disneyland moved closer to the core of the company, nearly rivaling the motion picture studio in centrality.</p></li><li><p> “Disney World Florida” is tucked down in the corner, but wouldn&#39;t open until October 1971. The trend is obvious: theme parks (including, eventually, <a href="https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/">floating ones</a> <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-17">1</a></sup> ) would replace movies as the core of the company.</p></li><li><p> Unfamiliar to me was a box named “Mineral King”, illustrated with a skiing Goofy. <a href="https://yesterland.com/mineralking.html">Turns out this was to be a ski resort in Sequoia National Forest</a> in California, with land rights granted by the National Forest Service in 1965. Embroiled in lawsuits from the no-fun Sierra Club for a decade, Disney abandoned the project in 1976.</p></li><li><p> “Comic strips” are listed separately from “publications” on both charts. I&#39;m old enough to remember reading the newspaper comics page daily, but not old enough to remember when Mickey and pals were on them. Pre-TV, a daily newspaper comic strip filled the role that social media does today: a free way to engage everyone with small nuggets of entertainment. <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-17">2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p> Lastly, WED Enterprises — aka Imagineering — is a big part of the 1967 chart, but wasn&#39;t even listed on the 1957 one. [ <strong>Update:</strong> WED was a private company owned by Walt, personally, until 1965, which explains its omission from the 1957 chart for the Disney company.] Disney was, and should remain, a serious engineering company. In 1967, WED engineers were creating everything from theme park animatronics to transportation systems. Sounds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">familiar</a> . Queue Alan Kay&#39;s adage: “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” Also, the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/apple-micro-led-cook-doctrine">Cook Doctrine</a> : “We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make.”</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-17"><p> It&#39;s kinda bananas that Disney&#39;s <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">theme</a> <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/">park</a> and <a href="https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/">cruise line</a> websites are still subdomains of go.com. Not to mention that the root-level <a href="http://go.com/">go.com site</a> is so bare-bones that it isn&#39;t even served using HTTPS. Disney&#39;s go.com domain name is a vestige of the late 1990s “portal” craze — but Disney <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2590562/disney-to-stop-go-com.html">abandoned the portal itself in 2001</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-17"><p> In October 1930, near the outset of the strip&#39;s decades-long run and only two years after Mickey debuted in <em>Steamboat Willie</em> , there was a bizarrely dark week-long storyline <a href="https://www.retroist.com/p/mickey-mouse-suicide">where each day&#39;s gag involved Mickey trying to kill himself</a> because Minnie had left him for another mouse.
