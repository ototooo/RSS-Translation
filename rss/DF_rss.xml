<p>昨天我简短的“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">不是那种‘开放’</a> ”文章<a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230620/p9#a230620p9">引起了一些人的共鸣</a>。</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@chrismessina/110573508557787120">克里斯·梅西纳</a>：</p><blockquote><p>不联合当然是管理员可以做出的选择，但考虑到 Threads 是从 Instagram 社交图谱中引导出来的，它不太可能产生影响。</p><p>您愿意将联邦宇宙限制在目前约 800 万的人口范围内，还是将其规模扩大到约 2.35B+？</p></blockquote><p>我认为大多数 Instagram 用户甚至不会尝试 Threads（或者无论它的名称是什么）。但很多可能。 “只需使用您现有的 Instagram 身份登录即可”是一个强大的诱惑。如果您已经拥有 Instagram 帐户，则可以直接加入。如何开始使用 Mastodon（或任何其他 ActivityPub“Fediverse”平台）一直是采用的巨大障碍。人们觉得它很混乱，人们也不喜欢被混乱。 “只需使用您的 Instagram 身份”一点也不令人困惑。</p><p>我认为有很多乳齿象的长期用户<em>喜欢</em>它没有获得主流关注这一事实，并希望保持这种状态。但不要称其为“开放”。</p><p><a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110573756551776352">敢于奥巴桑乔</a>：</p><blockquote><p>对于正在运行基于可互操作协议的去中心化社交网络的各种 Mastodon 管理员来说，这是一个奇怪的目标，他们承诺如果建立在相同的开放协议上，他们不会与现有社交网络的服务进行互操作。</p><p>这甚至不是虚伪的，它只是愚蠢的并且破坏了可互操作协议的全部意义。</p></blockquote><p>这种虚伪让我很恼火，但我认为他是对的，这也是愚蠢的。 Mastodon 服务器管理员先发制人地承诺要联合线程，从而有效地保证其实例上的用户将与整个平台上潜在的大多数用户隔离。</p><p> <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/19.html">Dave Winer，脚本新闻</a>：</p><blockquote><p>他们将立即比现有的 ActivityPub 服务多出数百万用户，所以真正的问题是——谁被排除在外？ ActivityPub 的架构能否以某种方式抵抗硅谷规模的社交网络从来都不是一个好的赌注。这并不意味着没有答案，只是咆哮不是其中之一。你必须<em>思考</em>。</p><p>但这里有一些好消息。无法保证 Facebook 会在对他们重要的条款上取得成功。对于 Facebook 这样规模的公司来说，除非有 5 亿人使用他们的服务，否则可能不值得继续下去。播客经受住了无数次这样的攻击，始终保持着完好无损的状态。但播客“确实很简单”，并且联盟的好处是<em>用户</em>众所周知的。这就是它多年来不被大型公司掠夺的原因。</p></blockquote><p>昨天我引用了电子邮件作为大公司运行大型实例的例子，并且没有消除使平台变得伟大的开放性。播客可能是一个更好的例子。我并不认为播客的未来是理所当然的，但 20 年来，尽管有苹果、亚马逊、YouTube 和 Spotify 等巨头的存在，它作为一种开放媒体仍然蓬勃发展。最终，这些大公司的参与使得<em>开放</em>播客比我 20 年前想象的更加受欢迎和持久，因为他们将播客带入了大众市场。即使在开放平台上，我们也需要大型中心化参与者来扮演某些角色。例如，Apple 的 iTunes 播客目录。 Facebook 的 Threads 应用程序可能类似于 Apple Podcasts for Mastodon。</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@TNLNYC/110576140169004056">特里斯坦·路易斯</a>：</p><blockquote><p>反元 #Fedipact 只能实现一件事：确保 #ActivityPub 输给 Bluesky 协议。这就是这里的人们想要的吗？</p><p>作为 #openweb 的倡导者，我不这么认为。</p><p> Meta 加入 Fediverse 就像 AOL 加入互联网：它会吸引大量的人加入，产生一些摩擦，但最终会让网络变得更好，因为更多的人联合 #Mastodon、#kbin、#lemmy、#pixelfed 等Fediverse 的一部分使开放协议变得更加强大。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a>和<a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a>之于 Reddit 就像 Mastodon 之于 Twitter。毫不奇怪，本月他们<a href="https://kbin.fediverse.observer/stats">都</a><a href="https://lemmy.fediverse.observer/stats">看到了</a>新用户的涌入，但与 Reddit 相比仍然很小。</p><p>这个故事的一个有争议的方面是， <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384207">Meta 显然邀请了几个顶级 Mastodon 实例的管理员，根据保密协议向他们介绍他们的计划</a>。<a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/110573363201929310">蒂姆·布雷</a>：</p><blockquote><p>我的看法：</p><ol><li> Fedi 人员不应该参加 NDA 会议。透明度至关重要。</li><li>期望 Meta 的道德行为是不合理的。应该假设，如果他们能够通过剖腹联邦宇宙来获利，他们就会这么做。</li><li>有机会吸引 Meta 上的一些普通正派人类，因为他们不知道还有什么更好的存在。</li></ol><p>我可能不会解散。但只有大约 51/49。</p></blockquote><p>当然，目前这样的会议将在保密协议下进行。这是一款尚未发布且尚未宣布的产品。根据保密协议与 Facebook 会面本身并没有错——尽管我确实认为他们被邀请的事实本身不应该成为保密协议的一部分。透明度至关重要，但透明度可以在 Threads 实际宣布后实现。认为保密协议本质上是邪恶的想法只是阴谋论的无稽之谈。 （锡箔帽废话，唉， <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470">有一刻</a>。）</p><p>关于第二点，我同意在 Facebook 启动时对其进行两次打击。用短皮带拴住它们。他们开始胡闹，Mastodon 实例应该开始从他们的产品中解除联合。我只是不明白为什么他们应该被先发制人地阻止。像 ActivityPub 这样的开放协议的全部要点是没有人可以拥有它。我将以<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">昨天</a>提出的同样问题结束这篇文章：Fediverse 的目标是反企业/反商业，还是支持开放？我认为开放就是答案。其他人显然不同意。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 有关先发制人地阻止 Facebook 即将进入的 ActivityPub 条目的更多信息</title></entry><entry><title>为你制定规则，但不为我制定规则</title><link href="https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvm" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40018</id><published> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>比利·佩里戈，《时代》杂志报道：</p><blockquote><p> OpenAI 首席执行官萨姆·奥尔特曼 (Sam Altman) 上个月走遍了世界各国首都，在与满座观众的演讲以及与政府首脑的会晤中，他多次谈到全球人工智能监管的必要性。</p><p>但根据 OpenAI 与欧盟合作的文件，在幕后，OpenAI 一直在游说世界上最全面的人工智能立法——欧盟人工智能法案——的重要内容，以减轻公司监管负担的方式进行淡化。 《时代》周刊通过信息自由请求从欧盟委员会获得了官员的信息。</p></blockquote><p>我认为对人工智能现状的担忧有些过度，不需要监管。但 Altman 似乎推动的并不是监管机构的不干涉——相反，他只是希望将 OpenAI 并且只有 OpenAI 不受监管的规定写入法律。</p><p>几周前，谷歌泄露了一篇非常有趣且令人信服的论文，标题为“<a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">我们没有护城河，OpenAI 也没有</a>”。该论文的基本论点是，开源人工智能将超越谷歌和 OpenAI 的专有方法。自从我读到这篇泄露的论文后，我很清楚 Sam Altman 也相信这一点，因此他一直致力于创建一条<em>监管</em>护城河来保护 OpenAI。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“为你制定规则，但不为我制定规则”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>关于使用 iPhone 扫描二维码</title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/qr-code-scanning-easier-ios-17/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40017</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:52:13Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T02:01:48Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick 介绍 iOS 17 beta 1 中的一项调整功能：</p><blockquote><p>苹果在 iOS 13 中决定重新设计 QR 码扫描，以便该链接在相机取景器本身中显示为黄色按钮。然而，这样做却产生了一个新问题：如果相机镜头也在运动，按钮就会在取景器中四处移动，这使得点击它比以前更加棘手。</p><p>值得庆幸的是，在 iOS 17 中，苹果做出了另一项小而受欢迎的改变，极大地改善了这种情况。现在，当您扫描二维码时，链接按钮会自动出现在相机界面的底部。因此，您不必在取景器周围追逐跳舞的链接，只需点击快门按钮上方的固定位置即可。</p></blockquote><p>我扫描二维码的建议是根本不要使用相机应用程序。相反，请在 Contol Center 中启用 iOS 隐藏的内置代码扫描仪应用程序。转至“设置”→“控制中心”，然后在“更多控制”下启用“代码扫描仪”。 （这也是一个很好的提醒，您可以禁用很少使用的控制中心项目。）现在，当您遇到二维码时，只需下拉控制中心并使用代码扫描仪应用程序即可。</p><p>还值得记住的是，当您使用常规相机应用程序扫描二维码时，如果您打开链接，它会在 Safari 中打开。使用控制中心中的代码扫描仪应用程序，链接会在沙盒应用程序内 Web 视图中打开，该视图更加私密。唯一的缺点是，如果您想保留打开的页面，则需要在 Safari 中从 Code Scanner 中打开它。</p><p> Code Scanner 是一款非常棒的“做一件事并做好”的小应用程序，但由于您只能通过控制中心访问它，但默认情况下它不会显示在控制中心中，因此大多数人甚至不知道它的存在。这确实是一颗隐藏的宝石。</p><p><strong>更新：</strong>事实证明，您还可以<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/code-scanner-via-search.jpeg">通过在 iOS 主屏幕上搜索 Code Scanner 应用程序来启动它</a>。此外，您可以告诉 Siri“扫描 QR 码”或“打开 QR 码扫描仪”，它就会打开。好的！</p><div> <a  title="指向“使用 iPhone 扫描二维码”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>不是那种“开放” </title><link href="https://fedipact.online/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40016</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:27:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-19T23:08:39Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Christina Warren, writing at Inverse:</p><blockquote><p> But buried in the keynote was a macOS feature that Apple <em>should</em> have called out with more fanfare: DirectX 12 support for macOS. As PC gamers already know, this software support means the floodgates are open for some <em>real</em> games — not that casual <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/what-the-car-first-impressions-triband-apple-arcade">Apple Arcade stuff</a> — on Mac. Maybe, just maybe, this is the beginning of the end to the old joke that Macs can&#39;t play AAA games. [...]</p><p> DirectX 12 support within the Game Porting Toolkit skips right over all of these translations. With zero need to modify any game code, games such as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> , <em>Diablo IV</em> , <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-review">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em> , and <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hogwarts-legacy-unforgivable">Hogwart&#39;s Legacy</a></em> can now run on Apple silicon Macs <em>almost</em> as if they&#39;re native. Naturally (and quicker than anyone expected), enthusiasts and game developers started to try out the new toolkit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3n62FOX1Go">YouTube videos</a> , Reddit posts, and <a href="https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/Game_Porting_Toolkit#Game_compatibility_list">Mac gaming wikis</a> have been busy showing off some truly remarkable results on machines that just days earlier, were utterly unable to play AAA titles.</p></blockquote><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIPl71ZeOYk">This brief YouTube video from Dave Lee</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit Is Already Showing Results’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/warren-game-porting-toolkit">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Counterpoint: Flip Phones Are a Dumb Idea </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/23757846/flip-phones-forever-motorola-razr-samsung" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uve" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40010</id><published> 2023-06-15T00:29:19Z</published><updated> 2023-06-15T00:29:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>David Pierce for The Verge, “Every Smartphone Should Be a Flip Phone, Starting Right Now”:</p><blockquote><p> Okay, so I&#39;ve convinced you, right? Flip phones forever! Here&#39;s the problem: none of the flip phones currently on the market live up to this promise. There aren&#39;t even many to choose from. The Z Flip 4 gets a lot of things right, but it&#39;s held back by a too-small front screen and a just-fine camera setup. The new Razr Plus looks really promising, particularly because of its larger front screen, though its processor and durability ratings aren&#39;t particularly impressive. It also gets the software wrong, I think; letting me run full apps on the front screen isn&#39;t just silly — it runs against the whole appeal of a flip phone.</p><p> What we need is competition. That&#39;s going to take the rest of the smartphone world, from Apple and Google to Huawei and Oppo to Nothing and OnePlus, to all decide that flip phones are the future. They can and should keep working on slab phones and foldables because those have their place and their users. But we had it right in 2003: the best kind of phone is a flip phone. Phones got smarter, and their shape got worse. It&#39;s time for us to finally get the best of both worlds.</p></blockquote><p> I enjoy an honest contrarian take as much as the next person, but I legit don&#39;t get why any company makes one of these, let alone why Pierce would suggest they might go mainstream. Foldables I sort of get, in terms of potential — you carry a double-thick rectangular phone in exchange for a tablet-sized large screen when unfolded. I&#39;ve yet to see one that seems good, but I get the potential for the basic concept — bigger screens are better, all things considered. <em>Westworld</em> ’s super-thin tablets that fold into pocketable phones are the best vision for this I&#39;ve seen, and the best examination of <em>Westworld</em> ’s tablets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek">was published by ... The Verge, back in 2018</a> .</p><p> But a flip phone that folds into a double-thick square? I don&#39;t get it. You gain no reduction in volume or weight, and no increase in usable screen real estate. But now you have an extra step each time you want to use your phone, an additional point of mechanical failure on the device, and a form factor that isn&#39;t compatible with putting your phone in a protective case.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Counterpoint: Flip Phones Are a Dumb Idea’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Time Flies, Reddit-Scale </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvd" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/time-flies-reddit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40009</id><published> 2023-06-14T23:38:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-15T02:22:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> With just a few taps, you can create links between notes, making it easy to jump from one idea to another. Long press on a space in any note, and a new “Add Link” option can be found in the pop-up menu. Tapping it lets you link to another note by searching its title or entering a URL.</p><p> You can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just stick with the original title for clarity. Once you&#39;re done, the link appears as hyperlink-style underlined text in your note, and tapping it snaps you straight into the note you linked to.</p><p> The Notes app also offers an additional, quicker way to add links: Typing two greater-than symbols (>;>;) into a note invokes a list containing your six most recently modified notes, and tapping one instantly adds a link to that note.</p></blockquote><p> This feature doesn&#39;t just work for links between notes — you can add URLs of any sort, like the Edit → Add Link command in Mac apps.

<p>Right now, “Zero Trust” is in serious danger of becoming an empty buzzword. The problem isn&#39;t just that marketers have slapped the Zero Trust label on everything short of breakfast cereal — it&#39;s that for all the hype, <a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/the-biggest-data-breaches-and-leaks-of-2022">we don&#39;t seem to be getting any safer</a> .</p><p> At the heart of Zero Trust is a good idea, but the way most companies execute that idea is <em>incomplete</em> . Specifically, most security practitioners forget that device compliance is a crucial element of Zero Trust.</p><p> Think about it: your identity provider can ensure that only <em>known</em> devices access your company&#39;s apps, but just because you recognize a device, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s in a secure state. A malware-infected laptop running an outdated OS can&#39;t exactly be “trusted.” And you can&#39;t count on MDMs to achieve total compliance. Things like <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3HNQBX5">unencrypted access credentials</a> are out of their reach, not to mention <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3YinMcq">Linux devices writ large</a> .</p><p> Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta.</p><p> <em>Our premise is simple: if an employee&#39;s device is out of compliance, it can&#39;t access your apps.</em></p><p> Kolide&#39;s unique approach works with Okta to make device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn&#39;t compliant, users can&#39;t log in to their cloud apps until they&#39;ve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for IT, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/martini/images/kolide-device-blocked.png">Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own</a> .</p><p> Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon.

<p>My thanks to Retool for sponsoring last week at DF. Programming hasn&#39;t fundamentally changed in a long time. Building an app usually means searching for the right component library, debugging dependencies, rewriting a lot of boilerplate code, and figuring out where and how to deploy. Everything but solving the problem at hand.</p><p> Retool is a new approach, unifying the ease of visual programming with the power and flexibility of real code. Connect to any database or API. Use drag-and-drop to design your UI while simultaneously live-programming it. Deploy instantly and scale as you grow. You can use Retool to build web apps, native iOS and Android apps, and automated workflows to help your business run.</p><p> Retool&#39;s customers use it to solve all kinds of business problems 10× faster: Plaid uses Retool to manage integration product support. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. You, too, can use it to manage users and orders, analyze data, run developer operations, or build any other business-critical application, fast. <a href="https://retool.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball">Start building for free today</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Retool’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/11/retool">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/the_talk_show_live_from_wwdc_2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv8" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40004</id><published> 2023-06-10T18:37:49Z</published><updated> 2023-06-12T00:20:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Back in San Jose&#39;s historic California Theatre for the first time since 2019, special guests John Ternus, Mike Rockwell, Craig Federighi, and Greg Joswiak join me to discuss the news and announcements from WWDC 2023. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The moderators of the popular r/iPhone are taking it private:</p><blockquote><p> Q: <em>What does making r/iPhone private mean, in this case?</em></p><p> A: Taking r/iPhone private means that no-one, except moderators and approved submitters, can see the subreddit&#39;s front page. When attempting to access the subreddit, you will be met with a blank screen stating “r/iPhone has been set to private by its subreddit moderators.”</p><p> Q: <em>What does indefinite mean in this case?</em></p><p> A: Originally, the protest was planned to be 48 hours. However, after a shambolic AMA held by Reddit&#39;s CEO, it has become clear to us that Reddit doesn&#39;t intend to act in good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread libellous claims about another third-party developer, and then try double down by vilifying them, again, in an AMA, despite being proven as a liar by the developer through audio recordings, that&#39;s when we knew what we were up against. Therefore, the subreddit will be privatised until such time as a reasonable resolution is proposed.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/145vns0/the_future_of_rvideos/">The moderators at r/Videos are doing the same</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Q: <em>Won&#39;t Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?</em></p><p> A: This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the “health” of their site is more important to them.

<p>It&#39;s worth perusing the replies to Apollo developer Christian Selig&#39;s sunsetting announcement <a href="https://mastodon.social/@christianselig/110509739563895220">on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1666857672489189376">Twitter</a> (as well as the long thread <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/">on Reddit itself</a> ).

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> I gotta be honest, this Huffman guy sure looks like a lying creep, and all of Reddit&#39;s public statements about honoring third-party apps seem like an attempt to lie to Redditors so they don&#39;t look like the bad guys. But the bottom line is that Reddit repriced its API in order to bankrupt third-party apps. (Selig says he&#39;ll lose $250,000 in the shutdown.)</p></blockquote><p> It seems pretty clear that all of Huffman&#39;s recent decisions are driven by Reddit&#39;s hoped-for IPO. On one front is the ugly fact that Reddit&#39;s valuation is sinking. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/fidelity-reddit-valuation/">TechCrunch reported last week</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Fidelity, the lead investor in Reddit&#39;s most recent funding round in 2021, has slashed the estimated worth of its equity stake in the popular social media platform by 41% since the investment. [...]</p><p> This devaluation, part of a broader trend that has hit a variety of growth stage startups across the globe in the past year, raises uncertainties about whether Reddit will maintain its initial intent to reportedly go public at a valuation around $15 billion.</p></blockquote><p> On the other front is OpenAI, currently buoyed by a sky-high valuation, and which used Reddit content as part of its massive training data. The whole point of going from free-of-charge to very-expensive with these APIs is to get OpenAI and similar companies to pay for them. It&#39;s a pipe dream. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-openai-chatgpt-ipo-valuation-karma-2023-6">Julie Bort at Insider</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable. But we don&#39;t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free,” said Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit.</p><p> I asked ChatGPT if it is going to pay for Reddit data. It told me its training data cut-off was September 2021 so it didn&#39;t know what was happening after that date.</p></blockquote><p> Reddit already gave all its data to large companies for free. Huffman is trying to charge now for horses that were let out of the barn years ago. And he obviously doesn&#39;t care about Apollo or other third-party Reddit clients, or what these moves do to Reddit&#39;s reputation as a platform vendor. He&#39;s just trapped in a fantasy where investors are going to somehow see Reddit as a player in the current moment of AI hype.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reddit’s Hoped-For IPO and Pipe Dream of Cashing in on OpenAI’s Hype’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/reddit-ipo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Facing Reddit&#39;s Exorbitant API Pricing, Christian Selig Is Shutting Down Apollo </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40000</id><published> 2023-06-09T17:37:06Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T00:49:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Christian Selig, writing in r/apolloapp:</p><blockquote><p> Eight years ago, I posted in the Apple subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/">about a Reddit app I was looking for beta testers for</a> , and my life completely changed that day. I just finished university and an internship at Apple, and wanted to build a Reddit client of my own: a premier, customizable, well-designed Reddit app for iPhone. This fortunately resonated with people immediately, and it&#39;s been my full time job ever since.</p><p> Today&#39;s a much sadder post than that initial one eight years ago. June 30th will be Apollo&#39;s last day.</p><p> I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people, and come to terms with this over the last weeks as talks with Reddit have deteriorated to an ugly point, and in the interest of transparency with the community, I wanted to talk about how I arrived at this decision, and if you have any questions at the end, I&#39;m more than happy to answer. This post will be long as I have a lot of topics to cover.</p><p> Please note that I recorded all my calls with Reddit, so my statements are not based on memory, but the recorded statements by Reddit over the course of the year. One-party consent recording is legal in my country of Canada. Also I won&#39;t be naming names, that&#39;s not important and I don&#39;t want to doxx people.</p></blockquote><p> Given what we knew about Reddit&#39;s stance on this API pricing a week ago, this isn&#39;t surprising, but it still feels tragic. Apollo — like Tweetbot and Twitterrific before it — isn&#39;t merely a nice client for a particular service. It&#39;s one of the best apps ever made, full stop.</p><p> Let&#39;s stop attributing this shutdown to “Reddit” the company, though, and pin responsibility where it truly lies: on Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman, personally. When Twitter killed third-party clients everyone naturally and correctly pinned responsibility on Elon Musk, because Musk is very famous and very much public in his stewardship of Twitter now that he owns it.</p><p> I&#39;ll bet many of you reading this, even Reddit users, couldn&#39;t recall Reddit&#39;s CEO&#39;s name before I named Huffman above. But it&#39;s clear from Selig&#39;s description — and his receipts, as it were — that Huffman is intimately involved in this decision, and is not only responsible, but is actively besmirching Selig with provably false accusations of both extortion <em>and</em> shoddy engineering.</p><p> Reddit didn&#39;t kill Apollo. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman did.</p><p> Let&#39;s see if Huffman has the courage to go through with <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/">this planned AMA today to discuss Reddit&#39;s API policy changes</a> . I have one simple question for him: What do you think Reddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/d2njs/comment/c0x40yz/">co-founder</a> <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a> would say about this if he were still alive?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Facing Reddit’s Exorbitant API Pricing, Christian Selig Is Shutting Down Apollo’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Lionel Messi Is Coming to MLS, With a Revenue Sharing Deal From Apple </title><link href="https://500ish.com/apples-messi-strategy-48bd95fe006" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv3" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/messi-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39999</id><published> 2023-06-09T16:51:11Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T23:40:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MG Siegler:</p><blockquote><p> Earlier today, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-inter-miami-mls.html">announced</a> that Lionel Messi, the world&#39;s greatest soccer player, would be leaving Europe behind and joining Inter Miami. This matters because the biggest name in <a href="https://500ish.com/a-most-beautiful-game-e3a3dcbd228d">fútbol</a> (soccer), and arguably in all sports, is coming to America. But it also matters because he&#39;s coming to play in the MLS. A league that has an exclusive television deal with Apple. And as such, Apple apparently helped lure Messi over with an extraordinary offer: a cut of revenue from new subscribers to their Season Pass service.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d be very curious to learn just how big a revenue share Messi is getting from Apple, but regardless of the details, this is simply an extraordinary coup for both MLS and Apple TV+. There are only a handful of athletes who are so good, and so beloved, that they can singlehandedly elevate an entire <em>league</em> in a team sport. Lionel Messi is one of them.</p><blockquote><p> Of the people who got early looks at Vision Pro, there&#39;s seemingly universal praise for the NBA court-side and MLB dugout demos. These were apparently shot with special cameras which Apple manufactured to be able to capture footage that could take full advantage of the viewing experience on the new device. It will likely take a bit for this type of content to become more widespread and accepted amongst the leagues. You know where it won&#39;t be? MLS. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666535803068256259">I fully expect</a> Apple to be filming games with their new Spatial Cameras (I made up the name, but it seems like something they might use… ) soon, if they haven&#39;t started already! Apple isn&#39;t undercutting any other TV rights here (as they might be with say, the NBA), <a href="https://mgs.blog/skating-to-where-the-soccer-ball-will-be-bc889b8c368">they have exclusive rights</a> . To display any game, any time, <em>anywhere</em> on any device.</p></blockquote><p> It occurred to me after my demo with Vision Pro that it was slightly surprising that Apple included spatial presentations of NBA basketball and MLB baseball, but not MLS soccer — the sport TV+ is most all-in on. (Apple does of course have weekly national broadcasts of MLB with Friday Night Baseball.) But I&#39;ll eat my hat if Apple isn&#39;t planning to broadcast entire MLS games with this technology.</p><blockquote><p> And finally, fifth, much like Apple used AT&amp;T as their exclusive carrier for the iPhone when it launched,</strong"> <a href=”https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666536683251339272<strong>I could see them</a> using their MLS deal in a similar manner. That is, work with a league/carrier that is willing to break norms and allow Apple to be in control of the product and offering. And when it&#39;s a success, watch the other leagues/carriers trip over themselves to get in line. It worked with the iPhone. Will it work here? Feels like a pretty good bet to make.</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly what I was thinking when I mentioned <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos#fn2-2023-06-07">in a footnote in my first impressions piece this week</a> that the NFL in particular might have made a colossal mistake signing a long-term deal with Google for Sunday Ticket broadcast rights. Siegler&#39;s comparison to how Apple leveraged its initial exclusivity deal with AT&amp;T with the iPhone seems apt.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Apple also announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-scores-with-documentary-series-featuring-legendary-football-champion-lionel-messi-and-his-fifa-world-cup-career-culminating-in-his-dramatic-qatar-2022-win/">a four-part docuseries on Messi&#39;s career</a> coming to TV+.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Lionel Messi Is Coming to MLS, With a Revenue Sharing Deal From Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/messi-apple">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv2" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39998</id><published> 2023-06-07T18:21:22Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T03:41:45Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I got to spend about 30 minutes Monday afternoon using a Vision Pro and VisionOS at Apple Park, in a temporary “field house” building Apple constructed specifically for this experience. This was a one-on-one guided tour with someone from the Vision product marketing team, with the ground rules that I&#39;m allowed to talk about everything I experienced, but photos and videos were not permitted.</p><p> It was a very fast 30 minutes, and the experience was, in a word, immersive. I&#39;d pay good money just to run through the exact same 30 minutes again.</p><p> It was nowhere near enough time, nor was I able to wander far off the rails of the prepared demos. It&#39;s very clear that the OS and apps are far from finished. But even given the brevity of the demo and constraints of the current state of the software, there are a few things I feel confident about describing.</p><p> First: the overall technology is extraordinary, and far better than I expected. And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">like my friend and Dithering co-host Ben Thompson</a> , my expectations were high. Apple exceeded them. Vision Pro and VisionOS feel like they&#39;ve been pulled forward in time from the future. I haven&#39;t had that feeling about a new product since the original iPhone in 2007. There are several aspects of the experience that felt impossible.</p><p> Is it a compelling <em>product</em> , though? It&#39;s a famous Steve Jobs axiom that technology is not enough, that you don&#39;t make compelling products — let alone entire platforms — starting from advanced technology and working backward. You start with a vision for the product and platform experience and then create new technology to make it real. I simply can&#39;t say whether Vision Pro is going to be a compelling product. I spent too little time with it, the software as of today is too far from complete, and, most importantly, the whole experience is too entirely new and mind-bending to render any such conclusion.</p><p> But the potential for Vision Pro to be a compelling product, across several use cases, is obvious. This might be great. And without question it is interesting, and I think the fundamental conceptual bones Apple has designed for VisionOS lay the groundwork for a long future. The first generation Vision Pro may or may not be a successful product — I simply don&#39;t want to speculate on that front yet. But even just a small taste of VisionOS made me feel confident that it is going to be the next major platform for Apple and Apple developers, alongside MacOS and iOS/iPadOS. <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-07">1</a></sup></p><hr /><p> A few years ago I stopped wearing contact lenses and have since worn corrective eyeglasses full-time. Before my demo, a rep from Apple took my glasses and used a device to measure my lenses to provide corrective lens inserts for my demo unit. It only took about 3 or 4 minutes. When Vision Pro goes on sale next year, buying corrective lens inserts will probably work like buying eyeglasses online from a retailer like Warby Parker — you&#39;ll provide a copy of your prescription from your eye doctor. It&#39;ll be a slight hassle for us glasses wearers, but not much, and it&#39;s unavoidable. (I see pretty well close up without glasses, so I&#39;m curious how well I might see using Vision Pro without corrective lenses.) After the lens measurement I used an iPhone to do a brief facial scan akin to registering for Face ID (look at the phone, turn your head in a circle), and an ear scan. This test was for identifying a light seal that would best block light, and calibrating the speakers.</p><p> My demo was conducted in a relatively spacious living room. I sat on a couch. My tour guide, as it were, from product marketing sat on an arm chair next to the couch. We took a few minutes to go through the strap adjustments to make it comfortable on my face. My light seal was good, but not perfect. The single biggest downside from my demo experience is that Vision Pro feels heavier on your face than I had hoped it would. It&#39;s not uncomfortable — at least not for 30 minutes — but I never forgot it was there, and it just makes your head feel a bit front-heavy.</p><p> The first run experience wearing Vision Pro requires a few minutes of very simple eye-tracking calibration exercises. You hold your head still, and VisionOS shows a series of dots in front of you, on a pure black background. Moving only your eyes, not your head, you simply look at each dot in front of you as they appear. After a minute or two of that, boom, you&#39;re in.</p><p> What you see at first is just ... your world. You just see the room you&#39;re in. There&#39;s no status information, no metadata, no indicators. Just input from the cameras on the front of the headset, presented on the displays in front of your eyes. It does not magically look indistinguishable from real life, but it does not feel like looking at a screen <em>at all</em> . I perceived absolutely no latency. I definitely could not see pixels — the experience is “retina” quality. Apple is not yet stating what frame rate Vision Pro runs at, but I&#39;m guessing it runs at 90 frames per second, if not higher.</p><p> Again, it doesn&#39;t look at all like looking at screens inside a headset. It looks like reality, albeit through something like a pair of safety glasses or a large face-covering clear shield. There is no border in the field of vision — your field of view through Vision Pro exactly matches what you see through your eyes without it. Most impressively, and uncannily, the field of view seemingly <em>exactly</em> matches what you see naturally. It&#39;s not even slightly wider angle, or even slightly more telephoto. There is no fisheye effect and no aberrations or distortion in your peripheral vision. What you see in front of your face exactly matches what your own eyes see when you lift the Vision Pro up over your eyes. Imagine a set of safety glasses that used a glass treatment that gives the world a slight bit of a “film look”. A slight tint (that tint might get dialed in closer to reality by next year — to me it felt ever so slightly warm, color-wise), and a slight bit of visually flattering smoothness to everything.</p><p> To do anything in VisionOS, you start by single-pressing the digital crown button above your right eye. (The other top button, on the left, will be used to capture spatial photos and videos, but that button was disabled on our demo units yesterday). Press the digital crown button and boom, your home screen of app icons appears in a plane in front of you. Long-press the digital crown button and it re-centers your virtual world in front of whatever you&#39;re now looking at.</p><p> The navigation model of VisionOS is a breakthrough of conceptual simplicity. You simply look at something and tap your index finger and thumb, on either of your hands. I&#39;ll call this “tapping” for lack of a better verb. When you look at any tappable UI element in VisionOS, it is visually highlighted. This highlighting is extremely similar to the hover effect in iPadOS when using a trackpad or mouse. In iPadOS, if you move the mouse pointer circle to a button or icon, that button/icon pops a bit, visually. If you look at a button or icon in VisionOS, that button/icon pops a bit. Some apps have toolbars with a dark background and gray button icons. Look at a button and that button will turn white. Tap your finger and thumb while looking at it and it activates. That&#39;s it. Incredibly simple, surprisingly effective.</p><p> At first I found myself reaching out to pinch the icons and buttons I saw in front of me. Like if I wanted to activate Safari I&#39;d reach my hand toward the Safari icon and pinch it. That works fine. But it&#39;s completely unnecessary. You really can just leave your hands on your lap. It works when you try to pinch the actual virtual icon in your field of vision because you are looking at the icon, and your finger and thumb do tap, but your hands can be anywhere. All that matters is what you&#39;re looking at. It started feeling natural within just a minute or two, and I could feel myself navigating the interface faster as the demo went on.</p><p> The next most striking aspect of the experience is that everything in VisionOS is completely stable in space. Let&#39;s say you open a Safari window, then open a Messages window next to it. (You can move windows around the room by pinching and dragging on a “Window Bar” that hovers underneath every window. You can move windows left/right, up/down, <em>and</em> closer/further away from you.) Then you turn your head 90 degrees to your side, then turn your head to the other side, and then return your gaze to the center. Those windows for Safari and Messages do not move at all, relative to the real world. Not even a little. You know how when you use AR on an iPhone or iPad — the built-in Measure app is a perfect example — and virtual UI elements or items move around a little bit relative to reality as you pan and rotate the iPhone or iPad? There&#39;s nothing like that in VisionOS. Virtual elements are utterly stable. Obviously that&#39;s what you <em>want</em> in an XR experience, but to my knowledge no other headset can achieve this stability. My understanding is that this profound stability — this palpable <em>realness</em> of virtual elements — is thanks to the extraordinary precise eye-tracking that Vision Pro achieves. <em>Uncanny</em> is often a pejorative — eg with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> — but in this case I use it as strong praise. It is simply uncanny how Vision Pro makes virtual elements as spatially stable as the walls and furniture and people in the room around you.</p><p> There&#39;s also a top-level “Environments” tab on the left side of the home screen. Everything I&#39;ve described thus far took place in the de facto default “environment” which is your actual surroundings. But the Environments tab allows you to switch from pass-through camera reality to a virtual reality. One of the locations I experienced was Mount Hood. Choose it and it&#39;s like you&#39;re there. These environments are incredibly immersive, 360 degrees. And so instead of catching up on Mail and Messages in floating windows in your living room, you can do it while it appears like you&#39;re atop a mountain, or on a beach, or, well, anywhere. It&#39;s beautiful, and every bit as stable spatially as pass-through reality. When you&#39;re in an immersive environment, you can turn the digital crown to adjust how far it wraps around your field of vision. Fully immersive means you don&#39;t see anything from your actual physical environment; partial immersion dials it back from your periphery to the center, with blurred dream-like edges.</p><p> Lastly, “breakthrough” is Apple&#39;s term for a feature that identifies real human beings who approach you while immersed. They sort of fade in, as transparent ghosts. But not spooky ghosts. It&#39;s a seamless feature, and given my experience with other VR headsets, a necessary one to avoid being isolated from the people around you once you&#39;re immersed. You see someone fade into view, and you can turn the digital crown to dial back the degree of immersion and truly look at them.</p><hr /><p> Apple is <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1665806600261763072">promoting</a> the Vision Pro announcement as the launch of “the era of spatial computing”. That term feels perfect. It&#39;s not AR, VR, or XR. It&#39;s spatial computing, and some <em>aspects</em> of spatial computing are AR or VR.</p><p> To me the Macintosh has always felt more like a <em>place</em> than a <em>thing</em> . Not a place I go physically, but a place my mind goes intellectually. When I&#39;m working or playing and in the flow, it has always felt like MacOS is where I <em>am</em> . I&#39;m in the Mac. Interruptions — say, the doorbell or my phone ringing — are momentarily disorienting when I&#39;m in the flow on the Mac, because I&#39;m pulled out of that world and into the physical one. There&#39;s a similar effect with iOS too, but I&#39;ve always found it less profound. Partly that&#39;s the nature of iOS, which doesn&#39;t speak to me, idiomatically, like MacOS does. I think in many ways that explains why I never feel <em>in the flow</em> on an iPad like I can on a Mac, even with the same size display. But with the iPhone in particular screen size is an important factor. I don&#39;t think <em>any</em> hypothetical phone OS could be as immersive as I find MacOS, simply because even the largest phone display is so small. Watching a movie on a phone is a lesser experience than watching on a big TV set, and watching a movie on even a huge TV is a lesser experience than watching a movie in a nice theater. We humans are visual creatures and our field of view affects our sense of importance. Size matters.</p><p> The <em>worlds</em> , as it were, of MacOS and iOS (or Windows, or Android, or whatever) are defined and limited by the displays on which they run. If MacOS is a place I go mentally when working, that place is manifested physically by the Mac&#39;s display. It&#39;s like the playing field, or the court, in sports — it has very clear, hard and fast, rectangular bounds. It is of fixed size and shape, and everything I do in that world takes place in the confines of those display boundaries.</p><p> VisionOS is very much going to be a conceptual place like that for work. But there is no display. There are no boundaries. The intellectual “place” where the apps of VisionOS are presented is the real-world place in which you use the device, or the expansive virtual environment you choose. The room in which you&#39;re sitting is the canvas. The whole room. The display on a Mac or iOS device is to me like a portal, a rectangular window into a well-defined virtual world. With VisionOS the virtual world is the actual world around you.</p><p> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. Using a Mac, you are in a physical place, there is a display in front of you in that place, and on that display are application windows. Using VisionOS, there are just application windows in the physical place in which you are. On Monday I had Safari and Messages and Photos open, side by side, each in a window that seemed the size of a movie poster — that is to say, each app in a window that appeared larger than any actual computer display I&#39;ve ever used. All side by side. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Some of the videos in Apple&#39;s Newsroom post</a> introducing Vision Pro illustrate this. But seeing a picture of an actor in this environment doesn&#39;t do justice to experiencing it firsthand, because a photo showing this environment itself has defined rectangular borders.</p><p> This is not confusing or complex, but it feels profound. Last night I chatted with a friend who, I found out only then, has been using Vision Pro for months inside Apple. While talking about this “your real world room is your canvas for arranging your application windows” aspect of the experience, he said that he spent weeks feeling a bit constrained, keeping his open VisionOS windows all in front of him as though on a virtual display, before a colleague opened his mind to <em>spreading out</em> and making applications windows much larger and arranging them in a wider carousel not merely in front of him but <em>around</em> him. The constraints of even the largest physical display simply do not exist with VisionOS.</p><hr /><p> I&#39;d group everything I experienced Monday into three loose categories.</p><p> The first, for lack of a better term, is simply “computing”. Work, as it were. Reading web pages, talking via FaceTime, reading email or messages. Using <em>apps</em> . You start with an iOS-like grid of app icons, tap on apps to open them in windows, and arrange and resize those windows however you want. Text is very readable in windows. My brief 30 minute demo covered a lot, so I have zero perspective on how pleasant or tolerable it is to read for long stretches of time, but my impression is that it&#39;s more than fine. Windows look solid, text looks crisp, and you can make windows really big in virtual space. If anything is going to seem weird or wrong about long-form reading in VisionOS, it&#39;s not the visual fidelity, but rather the fact that I&#39;ve never once in my life read an article or email message in a window that appeared 4 or 5 feet tall.</p><p> The second type of experience is the consumption of 2D content, like photos and videos. Watching a regular movie on a virtual huge screen is incredible. It&#39;s way more like watching a movie in a real cinema than like watching on a TV. One of the movies Apple had us watch was James Cameron&#39;s <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> , both in a window floating in front of us, and then in “theater mode”, which immersively removes your actual physical surroundings. Cameron shot <em>Avatar 2</em> with state-of-the-art 3D cameras, and the 3D effect was, as promised, better than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in a theater or theme park. I don&#39;t generally like 3D feature-length movies at all — I find myself not remembering them afterwards — but I might watch movies like <em>Avatar</em> this way with Vision Pro. But even though <em>Avatar</em> is 3D, it&#39;s still a rectangular movie. It&#39;s just presented as a very large rectangle with very compelling 3D depth inside that rectangle.</p><p> The third type of experience is fully immersive. Content Apple commissioned and created that is inherently only consumable in three dimensions. Full immersion, like transporting you to a cliff&#39;s edge atop a mountain, or lakeside on a beautiful spring day. Some of these immersive environments surround you completely — you can turn around 360 degrees, and look up at the sky or down at the ground (or, dizzyingly, down over the cliff&#39;s edge). Another custom experience involved a portal opening on the wall across the room, out of which first flew a small butterfly that landed on my extended finger. This is so compelling that some of the media people who experienced it had their minds tricked into <em>feeling</em> the butterfly land. I did not, but I can see why they did. Then, a dinosaur — a velociraptor-looking thing, seemingly about 9 or 10 feet tall — approached the “portal” in the wall and came halfway through into the room. I was invited to stand up from the couch and approach it. There was a coffee table in front of the couch, a possible shin-banging accident waiting to happen, but the pass-through video experience is so seamless, so natural, so much like just looking through glasses, not looking at a screen inside a headset, that it took no concentration or carefulness at all on my part to stand up and walk around the coffee table and approach the dinosaur. The dinosaur was not pre-recorded. It reacted, live, to me, keeping eye contact with me at all times. It was spooky, and a significant part of my own lizard brain was instinctively <em>very</em> alarmed. I got extremely close to the dinosaur&#39;s head, and the illusion that it was real never broke down. Even up close, there was no sign that it was composed of polygons stitched together or something. It looked like a 10-foot tall dinosaur that could kill me with a snap of its jaws, right there in the room with me, as close to my face as the MacBook Pro display on which I&#39;m writing these words is right now.</p><p> Spatial photos and videos — photos and videos shot with the Vision Pro itself — are viewed as a sort of hybrid between 2D content and fully immersive 3D content. They don&#39;t appear in a crisply defined rectangle. Rather, they appear with a hazy dream-like border around them. Like some sort of teleportation magic spell in a Harry Potter movie or something. The effect reminded me very much of Steven Spielberg&#39;s <em>Minority Report</em> , in the way that Tom Cruise&#39;s character <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">could obsessively watch “memories” of his son</a> , and the way the psychic “precogs” perceive their visions of murders about to occur. It&#39;s like watching a dream, but through a portal opened into another world.</p><p> Lastly, we saw two sports demos: an at-bat from a baseball game at Fenway Park (Phil Schiller&#39;s hands are all over that one), and a scoring play from a Nuggets-Suns NBA basketball game. For the baseball game, the perspective wasn&#39;t even from the stands, but rather from the home team&#39;s dugout, ground level, right behind first base. It&#39;s not quite <em>just</em> like being there, but it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like being there. It&#39;s more realistic than seems possible. You choose where to direct your gaze: at the batter at home plate, at the pitcher, or out in the outfield. Or above the outfielders, at the scoreboard. For the NBA game, the perspective was courtside, right behind the basket. But better than the actual courtside perspective, because the perspective was slightly elevated above seating level. Fully immersive, fully three-dimensional, and seemingly perfectly to scale. Kevin Durant looked about 6&#39;10&quot;, right in front of me. Getting the scale just right is obviously the correct way to present this, but it seems devilishly tricky to actually pull off. Apple has pulled it off. These baseball and basketball scenes were shot by Apple using entirely custom camera rigs, and stored in altogether new file formats. This is nothing at all like 2D footage extrapolated into 3D, or just painted on a virtual circular wall around you. It looks real. It seems as profoundly different from watching regular TV telecasts of sports as TV telecasts are from audio-only radio broadcasts. <sup id="fnr2-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn2-2023-06-07">2</a></sup> It was incredible. I would genuinely consider buying a Vision Pro if the one and only thing it did was show entire sporting events like this.</p><p> The first two types of experiences — doing computer “work”, and watching 2D and 2D-ish 3D content, have analogs to existing experiences. Using Safari in VisionOS is like using Safari on a Mac or iPad, but with a different presentation. Watching a movie in VisionOS is just watching a movie, albeit with the completely convincing illusion that you&#39;re looking at an enormous room-filling cinema screen. But the third, these original immersive experiences, have no analogs except to the real world. It&#39;s extraordinary, and only possible because Apple has gotten so many little things so exactly right.</p><p> I walked away from my demo more than a bit discombobulated. Not because it was disorienting or even the least bit nauseating, but because it was so unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. It strikes me that in some ways Bob Iger&#39;s cameo during the keynote had the relationship between Apple and Disney backwards. Iger spent his keynote cameo talking about Disney creating original new content for VisionOS&#39;s new medium. But after experiencing it, it felt more like what Disney should want is Apple providing this technology for Disney to use in their theme parks. The sports and dinosaur demos I experienced using Vision Pro were in many ways more immersive and thrilling than tentpole major attractions I&#39;ve experienced at Disney World.</p><p> Are you going to want to buy a Vision Pro for $3,500? That price is high enough that the answer is probably not, for most of you, no matter how compelling it is. But are you going to want to try one out for an hour or two, and find yourself craving another hour or two? I guarantee it. You need to see it. <sup id="fnr3-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn3-2023-06-07">3</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-07"><p> I mean no disrespect to WatchOS or even tvOS by leaving them off that list.

<p>Science fiction writer Ted Chiang, in an interview with Madhumita Murgia for The Financial Times ( <a href="https://archive.is/2023.06.04-050658/https://www.ft.com/content/c1f6d948-3dde-405f-924c-09cc0dcf8c84">Archive.is link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Chiang&#39;s main objection, a writerly one, is with the words we choose to describe all this. Anthropomorphic language such as “learn”, “understand”, “know” and personal pronouns such as “I” that AI engineers and journalists project on to chatbots such as ChatGPT create an illusion. This hasty shorthand pushes all of us, he says — even those intimately familiar with how these systems work — towards seeing sparks of sentience in AI tools, where there are none.</p><p> “There was an exchange on Twitter a while back where someone said, &#39;What is artificial intelligence?&#39; And someone else said, &#39;A poor choice of words in 1954&#39;,” he says. “And, you know, they&#39;re right. I think that if we had chosen a different phrase for it, back in the &#39;50s, we might have avoided a lot of the confusion that we&#39;re having now.”</p><p> So if he had to invent a term, what would it be? His answer is instant: applied statistics.</p></blockquote><p> My puerile mind is tempted to make a joke that tacking on “system” would make for a fun acronym, but I shan&#39;t crack that joke, as I think Chiang makes a strong point here. What we have with these LLMs isn&#39;t low-level intelligence but rather high-level applied statistics that creates the powerful illusion of low-level intelligence.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> Chiang&#39;s very short story “ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a">What&#39;s Expected of Us</a> ”, referenced in the interview.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ted Chiang on AI: ‘The Machines We Have Now Are Not Conscious’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/04/chiang-ai">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sky Guide </title><link href="https://www.fifthstarlabs.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uux" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/03/sky-guide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39993</id><published> 2023-06-04T02:15:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-04T02:15:34Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/1659593595643662336-vhv6gL8w">Ben Bajarin on Twitter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If Apple is releasing a VR/AR headset this year, it makes more sense for a dedicated event or bundle it with a Mac event in the fall.</p><p> There is too much ground to cover at WWDC, and 30 min is not enough to tell the full product story.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been thinking about this too. The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple&#39;s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we&#39;re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it&#39;s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that&#39;s an easy announcement: it&#39;s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it&#39;s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850">Last year&#39;s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos">here&#39;s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p><p> But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There&#39;s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn&#39;t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn&#39;t. They might have ideally wanted to announce it <em>before</em> this year&#39;s WWDC at a special event, but if they want developers to start creating software for the platform, this is the time. (And why wouldn&#39;t they want developers to start working on ideas?)</p><p> Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p><p> Here&#39;s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren&#39;t just pre-recorded, they&#39;re very tightly edited. I suspect we&#39;ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It&#39;ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem with the new “keynote movie” format. <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-19">1</a></sup> We won&#39;t come out of the keynote thinking it was too long; we&#39;ll come out of it with our heads spinning because it&#39;s going to cover so much, so fast.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-19"><p> And if I&#39;m right, I bet this is one of those years where after the keynote is over, and people start poring over everything Apple puts on the web, we discover a surprising number of very cool iOS and MacOS features that didn&#39;t make it into the keynote. Anything and everything from the OSes might get cut to make time for the headset, xrOS, and Mac hardware announcements. There&#39;s a whole second State of the Union technical keynote in the afternoon where features cut from the main morning keynote can go. <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ On Apple Fitting a Headset Announcement Into the Always-Packed WWDC Keynote </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/do_wall_street_journal_reporters_read_the_wall_street_journal" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/ut6" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39930</id><published> 2023-05-19T01:41:49Z</published><updated> 2023-05-20T00:34:04Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> In a sense, Apple *does* have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make the first one good enough to be criticized. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie, reporting last week for The Wall Street Journal, “ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-is-breaking-its-own-rules-with-a-new-headset-80c9b36c">Apple Is Breaking Its Own Rules With a New Headset</a> ” ( <a href="https://apple.news/AdSGSL1h8RBa5WioRJe_T9g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s launch plans break many of its traditions and rules about new products that have become the industry gold standard. Unlike other Apple products, the device is debuting in a still-experimental mode. Apple predicts slower adoption for the headset compared with the Apple Watch or the iPhone, both of which quickly became consumer must-haves. Taking seven years in development before hitting the market, it will be one of the most complex consumer products any company has ever sold.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a lot to unpack in one paragraph. Here goes:</p><p> I&#39;d argue Apple has never introduced two new products the same way. Every new product introduction has been different. I honestly don&#39;t know any more about the headset than the rumor mill consensus but I guarantee it isn&#39;t in an “experimental mode”. Neither Apple Watch nor iPhone “quickly became consumer must-haves”. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">Here&#39;s a report from Daisuke Wakabayashi</a> in ... <em>checks notes</em> ... The Wall Street Fucking Journal itself in April 2016, a year after Apple Watch shipped, that says, in the opening paragraph, “Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple&#39;s most popular devices: disappointment.” (The next paragraph claimed that “sales of iPhones are slowing”.) <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-18"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-18">1</a></sup></p><p> The pattern for Apple&#39;s entries into new product categories generally goes like this:</p><ul><li> Apple releases the first version. It&#39;s expensive. It&#39;s missing a few obvious features. It has a few obvious limitations. But it&#39;s a breakthrough.</li><li> Early adopters wait in line outside Apple Stores overnight to buy it. Online sales are backordered by weeks or even months soon after they launch.</li><li> That early fervor aside, it&#39;s an early adopter product, and sales are less than those of Apple&#39;s established products.</li><li> After a few months or maybe a year, the immediate-gratification-obsessed business press runs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">articles</a> declaring the product a dud.</li><li> Apple releases a second-gen version that&#39;s better. Sales go up. Word continues to spread.</li><li> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">With each successive year</a> , Apple releases improved models. Those obvious missing features are added. The obvious limitations are removed. Older models stay on sale at lower price points. It becomes a hit product.</li><li> Years later, when Apple is poised to release another altogether new product, the last one — the one written off as a dud after its first year — is held up as a product that was universally hailed as a sensation and smash hit from day one.</li></ul><p> A few paragraphs later in Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie&#39;s report:</p><blockquote><p> For Apple&#39;s first new major product in a decade — the Apple Watch was announced in 2014 — Chief Executive Tim Cook has a lot on the line as the device attempts to dominate the virtual world where people spend time for work or leisure, called the metaverse, which hasn&#39;t yet reached mass adoption or understanding.</p><p> There is growing skepticism among some investors and potential future partners that consumers will spend money and time on the metaverse. They note some early adopters are disillusioned with the technology.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s a sidenote perhaps, but I&#39;d argue that AirPods are a major new product — and that AirPods Pro are the first true mass-market augmented reality devices. The fact that they&#39;re audio-only, and not visual, blinds people (sorry) to the fact that they&#39;re <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/10/airpods_pro_first_impressions">remarkable AR products</a> . Apple doesn&#39;t break out unit sales, but estimates suggest that if AirPods — just AirPods — were a standalone company, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">it would have more revenue</a> than Nvidia, Adobe, or Uber, and might soon catch up to Netflix. But that&#39;s a sidenote.</p><p> The bigger issue is that back in October, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/26/stern-federighi-joz">in an on-stage interview</a> , Greg Joswiak was asked to complete the sentence “The metaverse is...”, and his answer was, “...a word I&#39;ll never use.” The fact that people don&#39;t use or even know what the hell the metaverse means is irrelevant to Apple&#39;s headset. I don&#39;t know how much more clear Joz could have been without revealing Apple&#39;s headset then and there — <em>Apple&#39;s not making something that&#39;s just like what other companies already have on the market</em> . That on-stage interview was with ... <em>checks notes</em> ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ugwoEOMvg">Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference</a> . It&#39;s enough to make you think Wall Street Journal reporters don&#39;t read The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> That no XR headset introduced so far has made much of a dent in the universe isn&#39;t a sign that Apple&#39;s effort is ill-fated. It&#39;s a sign that Apple has an opportunity. In a sense, Apple <em>does</em> have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">the first one good enough to be criticized</a> .</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-18"><p> Here&#39;s a paragraph for the Annals of Prognostication from that same 2016 Wakabayashi report for the Journal:</p><blockquote><p> And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a “flop.” Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn&#39;t be a “home run” like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn&#39;t want to wear a computer on their wrist.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/fred-wilson-predictions">Fred Wilson</a> , the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/05/wilson">next best thing</a> to <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/10/cnbcs-jim-cramer-touted-silicon-valley-bank-stock/">Jim Cramer</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Do Wall Street Journal Reporters Read The Wall Street Journal? </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/lets_check_in_on_supermicro" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/ut4" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39928</id><published> 2023-05-18T21:19:24Z</published><updated> 2023-05-18T22:17:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> What a nice postscript to a disgraceful story. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@kimahlberg/110386827166566142">Kim Ahlberg, posting on Mastodon</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Putting some money into SMCI after reading <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">@gruber</a> &#39;s posts calling out Bloomberg¹ on their bullshit story has been a good move so far…</p><p> ¹ Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published “The Big Hack” in October 2018 — a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China&#39;s intelligence services. The story presented no confirmable evidence at all.</p></blockquote><p> Supermicro (SMCI) was the company whose server motherboards Bloomberg alleged were compromised by rogue chips designed to surreptitiously phone home to Chinese intelligence servers. Bloomberg presented zero actual evidence then, and five years later, zero evidence of such rogue chips has been found. Every company Bloomberg alleged was compromised flatly denied the report. Bloomberg has never retracted the report, thus forever tarnishing their journalistic integrity. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack">Here&#39;s my first report on the story</a> , and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bloomberg+big+hack">this search</a> should get you to my follow-ups.</p><p> When Bloomberg published their spectacular but seemingly completely false report, <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=smci+stock+price+september+2018+to+november+2018">Supermicro&#39;s stock price plummeted by almost half</a> , from $21.50 to $11.65 per share.</p><p> I can&#39;t believe I never thought to follow-up on their share price, given my years-long zealotry reminding people, via footnotes in other reports from Bloomberg, that “The Big Hack” was by all available evidence complete bullshit, yet never retracted.</p><p> Turns out Supermicro <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=smci+stock+price+september+2018+to+may+2023">has done OK in the intervening years</a> . Their stock closed today at $164.56 — over 14 times higher than it was after “The Big Hack” dropped. That&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/supermicro-stock-2018-2023.jpeg">a tidy return</a> for Ahlberg and anyone else who invested similarly. What a nice postscript to a disgraceful story.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Let&#39;s Check in on Supermicro, the Target of Bloomberg&#39;s &#39;The Big Hack&#39;</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
