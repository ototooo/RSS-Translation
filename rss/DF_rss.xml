<p>乔·罗西尼尔（Joe Rossignol），《宏观报道：</p><blockquote><p>去年，我们报道说，<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/apple-sues-former-employee-for-alleged-leaking/">苹果起诉其前软件工程师安德鲁·奥德（Andrew Aude）</a> ，以向记者提供有关公司未来计划的机密信息，包括<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/apple-launching-journaling-app/">有关期刊应用程序，Vision Pro Healt Design的详细信息</a>。</p><p>正如<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/07/former-leaker-sued-by-apple-has-now-apologized-as-the-lawsuit-is-dismissed/">9to5MAC报道的</a>那样，圣克拉拉县高等法院周四<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/825250528/Apple-Inc-v-Andrew-Aude-Stipulation-of-Dismissal">驳回了苹果和Aude达成解决此事协议后的诉讼</a>。该案驳回的法院文件没有提供有关该协议的任何具体细节，但Aude在同一天发出了公众道歉。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://x.com/andyaude1/status/1887639465574998500">Aude道歉，X</a> ：</p><blockquote><p>我在苹果公司担任软件工程师近八年。在此期间，我可以访问敏感的内部苹果信息，包括当时未发行的产品和功能。但是，我没有将这些信息保密，而是犯了与涵盖公司的记者分享此信息的错误。当时我没有意识到这一点，但这是一个深刻而昂贵的错误。我花了数年的建筑物毁了数百个专业关系。而且我作为软件工程师的成功职业生涯被脱轨了，重建它可能会非常困难。泄漏不值得。我真诚地向我的前同事道歉，他们不仅在为苹果公司的项目上不懈地工作，而且还要努力使他们保持秘密。他们应得的更好。</p></blockquote><p>我们不知道终止诉讼的Aude与Apple达成协议的条款，但是很高兴看到他和该公司在足够的条件下使Apple有足够的条件帮助他道歉。</p><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/apple-sues-leaker-andrew-aude">这是我从去年三月提起诉讼的帖子</a>，其中包括苹果公司提交的一些最重要的掘金，包括这一点：</p><blockquote><p>苹果在2023年秋天得知了奥德先生的不当行为。当苹果会见他讨论他不当披露时，艾德先生迅速通过他的行为（即使不是他的话）确认了他的罪恶感。在2023年11月7日的采访开始时，Aude先生反复否认他已经向任何人泄露了任何信息。他还声称他没有苹果发行的iPhone。假装需要参观浴室中期浏览期间，Aude先生在休息期间从口袋里提取了iPhone，并从其设备中永久删除了大量证据。这包括信号应用程序，该应用程序通过加密通信纪念他将信息泄漏到“ Homeboy”（以及其他可能的）的历史。 [...]</p><p>在Aude先生的屏幕截图中，纪念他与WSJ记者的交流，Aude先生大声疾呼，他无法“等待混乱爆发”，以反应即将发表的一篇文章，反映出他的信息泄漏。</p></blockquote><p>当您将这些聊天的屏幕截图保存到工作发行的公司控制设备时，端到端加密通讯无济于事。</p><p>和我自己的关闭：</p><blockquote><p>值得注意的是，直到2019年9月，他就加入WSJ之前，亚伦“ Homeboy” Tilley<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/u/aarontilley">一直是信息的记者</a>。无论如何，我敢肯定，WSJ将帮助他的法律账单。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="永久链接“苹果解决对信息泄露和WSJ的前雇员的诉讼”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/bootable_mac_startup_drive_backups_and_another_ode_to_superduper" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w27" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：//1.41551</id><published> 2025-02-06T19：07：17Z</published><updated> 2025-02-06T21：36：41Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我知道今天的存储方式不同 - 丰富，便宜，可靠 - 但是我仍然对植根于遥远过去的数据有感觉。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>戴夫·纳尼（Dave Nanian），<a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/happy_new_fix/">上周在衬衫口袋博客上</a>：</p><blockquote><p>只是一个快速的帖子：MacOS 15.3现在已经淘汰，并且使用它，这是损坏的复制器的修复程序。因此，MacOS复制将再次使用擦除，然后复制备份。不需要更新超级制（但请随时安装我们的v3.10 beta 2，下面）。 [...]</p><p>感谢您在等待Apple的解决方案时的耐心配合。我知道我（希望）由于此而不再受到支持的轰炸！</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/macos-15-2-bootable-backup-bug">您可能还记得</a>，这是MacOS 15.2中引入的漏洞，它阻止了衬衫口袋出色的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/superduper">长期</a>实用工具<a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">超级飞机，</a>使您可以制作出启动驱动器的启动克隆。好消息，纠正的虫子，欢呼。</p><p>不过，早在12月，当这个虫子刚刚开始流传时， <a href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>的开发商Mike Bombich（长期以来也是Superduper的急救人员）写了一篇文章，我提出了我建议他认为该虫子不是的帖子一个错误，“ <a href="https://bombich.com/blog/2024/12/19/bootable-backups-have-been-deprecated-for-several-years">可启动备份已被弃用了几年</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>尽管有些开发人员似乎对MacOS 15.2的变化感到惊讶，但我们已经知道几年来，最终将不可能进行启动备份。我们将CCC的策略转移到了依赖外部引导，因此我们的用户不会受到不可避免的结果的影响。</p><p>上周我休假了几天，以帮助家庭成员，然后回到Mac社区，所有的人都在狂奔的MAC社区，并评论了可引导备份后15.2更新后无法使用的备用备份，并且对Apple进行了比较与Grinch的比较。在审查了有关此主题的很多评论之后，我觉得是时候进行权衡了。苹果在15.2的“虫子”中占用了很多热量，但是如果这里有任何指示，我认为应该指导倾向于误导其用户的开发人员认为，ASR和“可启动备份”在后杆后的备用/恢复策略中都有任何位置。</p></blockquote><p>感觉就像有些阴影向Nanian和衬衫口袋扔了，但是在这里我们使用Macos 15.3，可引导的启动驱动克隆又回来了，所以我不得不质疑谁需要在这里戴太阳镜。</p><p>我认为没有人会质疑“创建可引导的启动驱动器克隆”在苹果硅时代变得复杂，该苹果时代从2020年底Macos 11 Big Sur开始。更不用说从HFS+转换引入的并发症在2017年获得MACOS 10.13 High Sierra的APF，并在2019年与MACOS 10.15 Catalina饮用的启动音量。M系列Macs Boot Whorirder多于基于Intel的Mac。还<em>不错</em>。我认为这是在追求安全方面都是合理的（SIP代表<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102149" title="苹果支持：“关于Mac上的系统完整性保护”">系统完整性保护</a>，并且被恰当地命名）和优雅的系统体系结构。但是现在，启动是<em>造型，而不是奇怪的</em>是超级和碳复制克隆器等工具的怪异。</p><p>的确，从<em>大多数</em>Mac用户的角度来看，所有这些事情都是明确改变的。灾难性的引导驱动误差似乎比以往任何时候都少。其中的一部分仅仅是因为SSD比旋转硬盘要可靠得多，但其中的一部分也是APF似乎比HFS+曾经更可靠。 HFS+并不是不可靠的，并且其可靠性随着Mac OS X 10.3 Panther <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-06">1</a></sup>的添加而升级，但APF似乎更可靠。当灾难袭击时，恢复的途径比以往任何时候都更好。在过去，您需要找到可启动的系统软件DVD（或返回时间，是CD或软盘...）或可引导的USB驱动器，然后从磁盘中重新安装OS。但是，近年来，它被内置的<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="苹果支持：“ MacOS恢复介绍”">MACOS恢复</a>系统所取代，该系统使您可以执行诸如运行磁盘实用程序，从时间机备份还原，从Scratch重新安装整个操作系统等事情。没有寻找特殊的CD/DVD或Thumb Drive（墨菲的定律表明，当您突然发现自己需要一个时，您不会方便）。只需将Mac和Boom上的电源按钮长时间 - 您处于恢复模式。</p><p>我没有数据可以证明APF比HFS+更可靠，因此要检查我的直觉，我问John Siracusa（Filesysty Aficionado <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-06">2</a></sup> ）和Nanian（在Superduper客户支持的沟渠中工作）。双方都同意APF更可靠。不过，纳米（Nanian）进一步观察到，当事情确实在APFS磁盘上发生灾难性错误时，它往往处于非常低的水平 - 容器或体积水平的腐败。而且，如果苹果自己的磁盘实用程序无法修复它，则没有任何第三方工具可以。 <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-06">3</a></sup>那是坏消息。好消息是，如果问题确实只是出于无法校正的损坏（而<em>不是</em>设备的硬件故障），则可以使用恢复完全擦除驱动器和容器，清洁安装OS并从备份驱动器中还原数据使用移民助理 - 几乎肯定会起作用。</p><p>因此，从某种意义上说，论点提出，不再需要启动驱动器的可启动克隆。只需克隆您的数据，而不是整个驱动器，即用于备份目的的外部驱动器，如果您的启动卷出现问题：</p><ol><li> <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="苹果支持：“ MacOS恢复介绍”">引导到恢复</a>。</li><li>尝试使用恢复内部的磁盘实用程序来修复启动磁盘。从层次上讲，您首先在音量级别上执行此操作，然后在容器级别，然后是设备本身。设备包含容器，容器包含卷，您应该从内而外维修。 Apple的支持文档“ <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/repair-a-storage-device-dskutl1040/mac" title="Apple支持：“在Mac上维修磁盘实用程序中的存储设备”">修复Mac上的磁盘实用程序中的存储设备</a>”，并说明了这一过程。</li><li>如果磁盘实用程序无法修复它，请使用恢复擦除磁盘，然后安装OS。</li><li>在清洁安装后的第一个引导过程中，选择“还原”的选项（实际上像运行迁移助手一样），然后选择您的外部驱动器，并在上一个启动卷中的备用克隆作为源。换句话说，将修复的Mac视为是一个全新的Mac。 （如果您要创建一个新的新鲜用户帐户，那么您就走得太远了。）</li></ol><p>您在上面的步骤3中使用的备份不需要在其上安装MACOS，或者，如果它具有MacOS的可启动副本，则该版本不需要是MacOS的MacOS版本内部驱动器。在SuperDuper中，您可以使用智能更新使用“备份 - 所有文件”，该更新键入可写入的“数据”卷中的所有内容，但不会从读取的“系统”（OS）卷中复制OS（因为它由于您和我不必担心的技术原因，不能 - 认真地说，这些东西会带您<em>深入</em>杂草）。</p><p>但是，让我尝试通过我作为超级用户想知道和理解的我的速度来速度。要将您的内部启动驱动器的克隆到外部驱动器中，您想使用“备份 - 所有文件”。 （Superduper的“备份 - 用户文件”只会备份用户帐户中的内容<code>/Users/</code> 。它将包含您的大多数个人文件，但它不包括所有用户之间共享的全系统数据，例如您已在顶级<code>/Applications/</code> <code>/Library/</code>夹中安装的应用程序，或者我确定有些人需要“备份 - 用户文件”，但我不需要指出。从“备份 - 用户文件”中包含克隆的数据的外部驱动器无法作为我的迁移助手的来源。迁移助理，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs#fn2-2020-11-17">正如我之前写的那样</a>，这是一个惊人的好工具。）</p><p>当您运行“备份 - 所有文件”时，您有以下选项： <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-06">4</a></sup></p><ul><li><em>擦除，然后复制</em>- 在内部启动驱动器的整个内容上复制之前，它会完全擦除外部目标卷。这要比智能更新更长，但重要的是，“擦除，然后复制”将克隆<em>整个</em>内部磁盘，包括包含MACOS的只读系统卷。这应该使您拥有启动驱动器的<em>可引导</em>克隆。</li><li><em>智能更新</em>- 这可以实现您认为“智能”更新会做的事情。它并没有每次复制所有内容，而只是复制并擦除目标磁盘上与源磁盘上数据量相同的数据量所需的内容。如果您从新鲜的空外部驱动器作为目的地开始，它必须复制所有内容，但是随后的智能更新运行将在一部分时间内运行。但是，其工作方式的性质意味着它只能克隆启动驱动器的读/写数据量。这意味着它不会从仅读取系统卷中复制操作系统。不管您要做什么（我要涵盖的），这没关系，因为智能更新的结果是包含您自己的所有文件和已安装的应用程序的外部驱动器，而且至关重要的是，这是一个磁盘用作迁移助手的来源。</li></ul><p>因此，如果您<em>始终</em>使用“擦除，然后复制”，那么您的SuperDuper外部备份将始终是启动驱动器的启动克隆，并安装了MACOS与内部磁盘相同的MACOS。这样做的唯一缺点是备份需要更长的时间，因为您每次都会擦除外部驱动器并复制所有内容。 （您不必以任何方式监督超级垃圾的备份，因此它们要花多长时间并不重要。）</p><p>如果您从“智能更新”<em>开始</em>，则不会具有可引导的外部驱动器（因为仅复制了仅读取的系统卷），但是您将拥有自己的所有文件，外部驱动器将作为源迁移助手。</p><p>如果您从“擦除，然后复制”<em>开始</em>以创建初始备份克隆，但是<em>随后</em>将“智能更新”用于增量备份，则每次备份时，所有<em>数据</em>和已安装的应用程序都会在外部驱动器上更新。并且该驱动器应仍然是可引导的备份 - 但是在外部驱动器上安装的MacOS版本将与初始“擦除，然后复制”备份保持不变。这就是我一直在运行Superduper的方式。</p><h2>为什么可启动备份驱动器仍然很重要</h2><p>在撰写本文的过程中 - 自12月以来，我一直在考虑并进行研究，当时MacOS 15.2复制器Bug破坏了Superduper创建可引导备份的能力 - 我已经动摇了一些关于我自己的长期假设我的备份需要。自从我开始使用它以来，我就一直用Superduper制作可引导的克隆，这是二十多年前。这篇文章最早提到了超级努力的大胆火球，他解释了我当时如何安装OS更新， <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/12/software_update" title="大胆的火球：“软件更新技巧和伏都教”">从2004年12月开始</a>：</p><blockquote><p>我使用<a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">Superduper</a>克隆整个启动驱动器。我强烈推荐它。</p></blockquote><p>还是真的！我无意停止使用Superduper定期备份整个启动驱动器。但是：我是否还在乎它们是否可以引导？如果您在12月之前问我，我会说是的。为什么？因为，我的想法就开始了，如果我的内部启动驱动器发生了一些灾难性的事情，而我正在努力紧急的事情，我想尽快起床并再次工作。与其等待MACOS恢复重新安装在内部驱动器上，然后等待迁移助手将我的数据从外部驱动器复制到内部驱动器上的MacOS安装，而只能从外部备份驱动器中启动并获取立即返回工作。</p><p>我多年来作为MAC用户很幸运，遭受了很少的磁盘灾难。但是我遇到了它们。在某些情况下，如果不是至关重要的，则具有最新的可启动备份驱动器是有用的。但是，经过反思，我现在意识到自上次我什至想从备用驱动器启动以来已经有很多年了。我曾经定期测试备份驱动器实际上是可引导的，以预防措施。我好几年没做到了。</p><p>我上面提到的是，对于我的常规备份克隆，我使用了Superduper的智能更新，这使MACOS在备份驱动器上的只读安装不变。我今天刚刚检查过，而我的MacBook Pro正在运行当前版本的MacOS（15.3红杉），而克隆的备份驱动器上的版本则为12.6.1 Monterey，该版本于2022年10月发布。 “<em>擦除</em>，然后复制”备用<em>。</em>例如，我所有的电子邮件文件均以MacOS 15.3中的Apple Mail预期的邮箱格式；我怀疑MacOS 12.6的Apple邮件是否可以读取这些邮箱文件。我使用的几乎每个应用程序（或至少来自Apple的每个系统应用程序）可能也是如此。当然，MacOS 12.6中的<em>一些</em>软件无法读取MacOS 15.3的软件中的文件或设置，我敢打赌很多不能。新软件通常可以识别由软件的旧版本生成的旧文件格式；旧软件无法识别编写旧软件后引入的新文件格式。</p><p>如果您真的希望通过SuperDuper备份可引导的启动驱动器备份，则应使用“擦除，然后复制”。或每次都使用“擦除，然后复制”。但是，过去两年我没有这样做的事实并不意味着我的克隆备用驱动器是没有用的。这仅意味着它仅对恢复备份数据很有用，而不是启动我的Mac。当我考虑它时，如果需要的话，我将如何使用它。我不在快节奏的生产环境中工作。无论如何，我认为MacBook确实只有从内部驱动器启动时才能正确运行。如果我的出现问题，我将尝试使用磁盘实用程序修复它，如果失败，我将转向MacOS恢复以清洁安装OS，然后使用迁移助手从外部备份中复制我的数据驾驶。</p><p>考虑一下，从包含当前版本的MacOS数据的外部备份驱动器上启动MacOS的旧版本听起来像是损坏该磁盘上某些文件的好方法 - 颠覆了备份的全部目的。 （很可能，如果您尝试此操作，Mac将根本无法启动。）当源驱动器的克隆失败时，从启动并“使用”备份驱动器是鲁ck的 - 那时，您的备份驱动器是您唯一来自该失败驱动器的数据本地副本。实际上，它应该被视为仅阅读的恢复来源。 MACOS恢复和迁移助理的设计方式使Mac的设计方式非常容易。</p><p>我上次在2010年遇到灾难性问题的问题是在2010年，我写了关于我如何优雅地恢复，没有戏剧性的戏剧性（似乎也是丢失的数据的iota），这是我的作品，标题<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox">为</a>“ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox">Diskwarrior，Superduper和Dropbox</a> ”。现在，我更多的数字生活在云中 - 因此至少在Mac的启动驱动器以外的地方复制了。在我的头顶上，我很难想到我在Mac上所做的任何事情都没有通过Dropbox，iCloud或IMAP同步到云存储。从2014年开始，我也一直是<a href="https://backblaze.com/thetalkshow">Backblaze</a>的客户，Backblaze是一家设定的在线备份服务（多年来一直是本网站和脱口秀节目的常规赞助商，但我建议它因为这很好，不是因为他们已经过去了，有一天可能会再次成为赞助商）。那是我所有个人数据的<em>另一</em>副本，备份了某个地方。 <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-06">5</a></sup></p><p>可以启动我的超级式备份驱动器，这是一个不错的选择，但我真的不能说我<em>需要</em>它。 20、15，即使仅在10年前，这都是不正确的 - 我确实希望能够暂时从备份驱动器中启动。但这对我来说真的不再如此。也可能不适合您。对于大多数Mac用户来说，绝对不是正确的。</p><p>但是对于<em>某些</em>人在高压紧密的生产环境中使用（或负责）MAC的人仍然如此。实时广播工作室。杂志或报纸的截止日期为打印机，仅几个小时（或几分钟）。具有严格安全/隐私规则的位置，禁止云存储某些关键文件。如果生产计算机上的启动驱动器失败，则需要<em>立即</em>启动并运行。插入备份驱动器，重新启动并进行。更长的时间是不可接受的。</p><p>那不是我。那可能不是你。但是有很多人描述的工作环境。在许多方面，苹果硅Mac已成为类似iOS的设备，它们仍然是Mac的内心：工作站。苹果内也有人知道这一点。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-06"><p>有趣的事实从<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">HFS Plus的Wikipedia条目</a>中收集到：“开发中的代号<em>红杉</em>，HFS+是在1998年1月19日发行的Mac OS 8.1的发行中引入的。”我不知道这是否进一步证明了苹果对旧代码名称有偏爱，或者对于一家近49年历史的公司而言，不可避免的代码名称是不可避免的。 <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-06"><p><em>丁。</em> <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-06"><p> APF非常“现代苹果”的方式之一是它主要是黑匣子。在HFS+天中，有<a href="https://www.alsoft.com/">Alsoft的Diskwarrior-</a>始终能够表现出奇迹，完全修复（或至少恢复临时访问）苹果自己的磁盘实用程序无法修复的磁盘的内容。 Diskwarrior仍然可用<a href="https://www.alsoft.com/requirements">，但仅适用于HFS+卷</a>。我认为，没有任何第三方开发人员会将HFS+描述为“井”的记录，<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/hfs">但是通过API，它以低水平的方式记录了</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/file_system/about_apple_file_system">APFS不是</a>，并且几乎可以肯定永远不会。 <a href="#fnr3-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注3。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn4-2025-02-06"><p> SuperDuper还可以选择仅复制新文件，或者仅复制不同的文件，但我不想使用这些文件。 <a href="#fnr4-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注4。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn5-2025-02-06"><p>事后看来，这真是我的数据仅在我的年轻人中作为单个磁盘上的单个副本存在。令人惊讶的是，它幸存下来。作为80年代的孩子/青少年，我的一切仅存在于软盘上。即使是最小的容量硬盘驱动器也很昂贵。苹果的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Disk_20">硬盘20</a>是20兆字节的外部驱动器，在1985年首次亮相时，价格为1,500美元，今天的美元<a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">约为4,400美元</a>。那是一吨钱。但是当时的软盘仅为400 kb  - 硬盘20使您存储了其中的50个。但是，对于孩子来说，即使是软盘也很昂贵。我们将它们填满的速度比购买它们的速度更快，并且当我们需要“新”时，我们会一遍又一遍地重复使用相同的软盘。这对于存储介质上的数据完整性并不理想，以至于它暴露在空气中。在90年代，我们所有人都有硬盘驱动器，但是那些硬盘驱动器总是几乎饱满的。我们不断地将文件从硬盘驱动器中复制到软盘中以进行“存储”，以创建一些自由空间。当出现<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive">拉链磁盘</a>时，感觉就像是“超级软盘”，每个磁盘都包含100 MB。我们过着数字生活的生活，一个灾难性的硬盘驱动器失败，而不是丢失我们几乎所有的文件，按照当今的标准，那个时代的硬盘驱动器是地狱。 （如果您听到硬盘开始<em>点击</em>，您感到惊慌，并立即开始将最重要的文件复制到另一个磁盘或磁盘。）</p><p>我的祖父母的一代人生活在大萧条中，他们对我这一代人的眼睛陷入了困境，这是关于食物的可用性和丰富性的非常奇怪的想法。许多人在食物非常稀缺的时代长大的许多人，将食物视为余生的稀缺性。他们吃了盘子上的任何东西，无论他们是否喜欢它，他们都会被任何没有的人冒犯。</p><p>对我来说，很明显，当存储既稀缺又不可靠时，我是在计算时代的年龄。我喜欢认为我已经适应了时代，尤其是考虑到我为谋生而做的事情。我<em>知道</em>今天的存储方式不同 -

<p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/113940550587737112">昨天在Altstore公告</a>中发布：</p><blockquote><p> iPhone Turn 18今年，这意味着它终于足够老了，可以使用更多的〜成熟〜应用程序…</p><p>介绍了世界上第一个苹果批准的色情应用程序C1D3R的热水浴缸！</p></blockquote><p>默认情况下，屏幕截图和视频预览是模糊的，但是<a href="https://hottubapp.io/">Hot Tub的网站</a>非常清楚地表明，其汇总的内容是严重的色情内容。象征性地说，他们没有他妈的。从字面上看，这正是他们汇总的内容 - 包括应用内“青少年”频道。</p><p>如果我们慷慨大方，则将热水浴缸描述为“苹果批准”，如果我们不是宽容，并且毫无疑问。他们的意思是，热水浴缸​​被苹果（Apple）适当公证 - 表面上是技术性的，而不是社论，其中涵盖了（使用<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">苹果自己的文档中的</a>术语）精度，功能，安全性，安全性和隐私。我在那里说“表面上”是因为苹果出于其他原因拒绝公证应用程序，包括在11月<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">拒绝公证的经典MAC MAC MINI VMAC</a> ，理由是Mini Vmac都违反了Apple的软件许可和滥用Apple Apple的软件。商标。</p><p> But pornography has pretty much always been Apple&#39;s canonical example for the sort of content they do not want in the App Store, and thus — because Apple&#39;s stance is that the App Store ought to be the sole source for consumer software for iOS — the sort of content they do not consider appropriate for native apps. You&#39;ve been able to watch porno on your iPhone since the first day it shipped — a full year ahead of the App Store — by using the web. Apple&#39;s line has always been clear: native apps = Apple-approved; the web = anything goes. (That same line goes for payment processing for digital goods and services as well.)</p><p> Back in 2010, MG Siegler (then at TechCrunch) reported on an email exchange between Steve Jobs and customer Matthew Browing. Browing wrote to Jobs:</p><blockquote><p> It appears that more and more Apple is determining for its consumers what content they should be able to receive. For instance, the blocking of Mark Fiore&#39;s comic app (due to being political satire) or blocking of what Apple considers to be porn.</p><p> I&#39;m all for keeping porn out of kids hands. Heck — I&#39;m all for ensuring that I don&#39;t have to see it unless I want to. But… that&#39;s what parental controls are for. Put these types of apps into categories and allow them to be blocked by their parents should they want to.</p><p> Apple&#39;s role isn&#39;t moral police — Apple&#39;s role is to design and produce really cool gadgets that do what the consumer wants them to do.</p></blockquote><p> Jobs responded:</p><blockquote><p> Fiore&#39;s app will be in the store shortly. That was a mistake. However, we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone. Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.</p></blockquote><p> (The man knew how to write an email.)</p><p> Fast-forward to the present, and Apple has been citing pornography as one of its reasons for adamantly opposing the EU&#39;s DMA from the very beginning. Last year, after the DMA went into effect, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">FastCompany&#39;s Michael Grothaus interviewed App Store chief Phil Schiller</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Schiller is quick to point out that despite these new security measures, there are limits to the protections that Apple can provide to users who allow alternative app marketplaces to operate on their iPhones. The company has virtually no control over the content of apps from those marketplaces — even if that content is objectionable or harmful.</p><p> “Ultimately, there are things that we have not allowed on our App Store — things that we didn&#39;t think would be safe or appropriate,” Schiller says. “It will not be our decision whether those other marketplaces have the same terms and limitations.”</p><p> So yes, for the first time, apps dedicated to pornography can be run on the iPhone. This should be something parents are aware of, because the DMA does not give Apple the legal right to forbid certain types of app stores from operating on its platform, nor does Apple have the ability to prevent a child from downloading such an app store onto their iPhone。</p></blockquote><p> And, lastly, with regard to Hot Tub and AltStore in particular, Apple issued this statement to media outlets, including Daring Fireball, yesterday:</p><blockquote><p> We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids. This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world. Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store. The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.</p></blockquote><p> So, no, Apple neither approves of Hot Tub in particular, nor the ability to distribute native porn apps in general. Everyone involved with both AltStore and Hot Tub knows this, but they also know that framing it this way — the announcement came with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/introducing-hot-tub-banner.png">this banner graphic</a> promoting Hot Tub as “The First Apple-Approved Porn App” — is a good way to <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250203/p16#a250203p16">get headlines</a> . (The Verge: “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604937/iphone-ios-porn-app-hot-tub-altstore-pal-eu">The First &#39;Approved&#39; iPhone Porn App Is Coming to Europe</a> ” — which aside from the mild clickbait slant, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">misleadingly conflates “Europe” with “the EU”</a> .) But there&#39;s some undeniable <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/02/schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> seeing Apple on the wrong end <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">of notarization being used as a tool to convey subject-matter approval</a> . [ <strong>Update:</strong> And now <a href="https://www.threads.net/@altstoreio/post/DFqg4vfy7B4">it&#39;s become a thing</a> , where AltStore is sticking to their guns that Hot Tub, having been notarized, is thus “approved” by Apple. C&#39;mon.]</p><p> If we want to get nitty-gritty over verbs, I&#39;d argue that Apple <em>accepts</em> apps — like Hot Tub — for notarization, not <em>approves</em> . Begrudging <em>acceptance</em> is more of a thing than begrudging <em>approval</em> .</p><p> But, as Apple itself emphasizes in its statement, the DMA requires them to allow it. I&#39;ve seen no celebratory <a href="https://x.com/teresaribera">tweets</a> or <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/home/en">announcements from European Commission officials</a> celebrating the availability of Hot Tub. Just crickets chirping. When it comes to native iOS porn apps, the EU now has an unequivocal advantage over not just the United States but the rest of the world. You&#39;d think they&#39;d want to celebrate the achievement.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;Hot Tub&#39;, a Hardcore Porn App for iOS, Hits AltStore in the EU</title></entry><entry><title>抖动</title><link href="https://dithering.fm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w23" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/dithering" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41547</id><published> 2025-02-04T18:09:14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T18:09:15Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat">Speaking of books</a> , Simon &amp; Schuster announced a new one:</p><blockquote><p>苹果不仅是一个品牌；这是世界上最有价值的公司，也是二十一世纪定义产品的创建者。 iPhone彻底改变了我们的生活，工作和联系方式。但是苹果现在是自己成功的受害者，在两个超级大国之间的新冷战中间被捕获。</p><p>在1996年破产的边缘，苹果制定了一项新战略，将其制造业外包。在八个国家进行了实验之后，几乎所有的行动都被负担得起的无处不在劳动的承诺引诱到中国。 As the iPod and iPhone transformed Apple&#39;s fortunes, their sophisticated production played a seminal role financing, training, supervising, and supplying Chinese manufacturers — skills Beijing is now weaponizing against the West.</p><p> <em>Apple in China</em> is the sometimes disturbing and always revelatory story of how an outspoken, proud company that once praised “rebels” and “troublemakers” — the company that encouraged us all to “Think Different” — devolved into a silent, passive partner to a好战的政权越来越控制其命运。</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve long been a fan of McGee&#39;s work as the Financial Times&#39;s Silicon Valley correspondent.

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">Speaking of cheating</a> , my favorite book from Trump&#39;s first term was Rick Reilly&#39;s <em>Commander in Cheat</em> , which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/09/commander-in-cheat">I linked to</a> , with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/02/donald-trump-golf-28-club-championships">an excerpt still available at The Guardian</a> , when it came out in 2019.

<p>Drew Harwell, at The Washington Post (gift link, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lguxbx6fgc25">via Harwell himself on Bluesky</a> — which seemingly uses a ludicrously long 397-character token in the URL):</p><blockquote><p> But after poring over his live-streamed gameplay, online sleuths recently made a shocking accusation: Musk had cheated. They suspected that he had pursued a widely mocked tactic known as “boosting,” paying strangers to play his character and rake in loot so that, when he logged in, he could face challenges with the most powerful gear.</p><p> Musk fought the allegations before ultimately confessing in messages this month. “It&#39;s impossible to beat players in Asia if you don&#39;t,” he wrote. A few days later, his character could be seen chasing treasure through the game&#39;s sulfuric caverns while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/billionaires-trump-inauguration-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/">Musk was in the Capitol Rotunda, attending President Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Every cheater&#39;s story is the same: “ <em>I&#39;m not cheating, and I&#39;m offended you&#39;d accuse me.</em> ” Then, presented with incontrovertible proof, “ <em>I had to cheat because everyone else is cheating so it&#39;s the only way to win, and anyone who isn&#39;t doing it is a simp.</em> ” But the simple truth is that cheaters are rotten people, and most people naturally despise cheating.</p><blockquote><p> But watching Musk&#39;s streams, Jake began to suspect foul play. The billionaire did amateurish things, such as failing to drink mana flasks when he needed them and trying to pick up items when his inventory was full. And he made comments that struck devoted players as clueless, saying, for instance, that his character&#39;s “Hand of Wisdom and Action” gloves, which rank among the game&#39;s most valuable items, “could be better.” A normal gamer could write these off as simple flubs in the heat of battle, Jake said. But Musk was supposedly a global grand master, and gamers at that level don&#39;t make these kinds of mistakes.</p><p> “It&#39;s like if you said you&#39;re the number two truck driver in the world … and when you try to get the truck to turn on, the windshield wipers start going,” Jake said. “It just felt like there was no way this guy did this.”</p><p> When Jake posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1hwxc17/documenting_the_saga_of_elon_musks_account/">thread</a> on Reddit documenting Musk&#39;s “suspicious” gameplay, the accusations kicked up a firestorm, with “Path of Exile 2” fans scraping through the streams Musk had posted to X for clues of what some were calling his <a href="https://x.com/Diamonte916/status/1878047536336052365">“stolen valor.透明</a>[...]</p><p> By paying someone else to earn him his high-level gear, they said, he had removed most of the challenge — only to boast how quickly he had beaten others who played fair and square. One poster on a Diablo subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1hxi3vh/gamers_are_accusing_elon_musk_of_cheating_at/">called</a> it “unbelievably pathetic” that the world&#39;s richest man would feel “the need to cheat” in a video game to “claim he is good at something” most people “couldn&#39;t care less about.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s the boasting that&#39;s most revealing.</p><p> It&#39;s a trope as old as fiction itself that villains cheat at everything. Auric Goldfinger cheated at golf, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBvu-fTTIk">famously</a> . And in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moonraker-James-Bond-Ian-Fleming/dp/1612185452/?tag=df-amzn-20">Ian Fleming&#39;s <em>Moonraker</em></a> (but not the movie), the whole plot was driven by M&#39;s suspicion that mysterious millionaire (the billionaire of the 1950s) industrialist Hugo Drax was cheating at cards at their gentlemen&#39;s club. He assigned Bond to figure out how he was cheating, and Bond stumbled into Drax&#39;s plot to annihilate London. Drax, you see, is in fact a Nazi. And his industry: rocketry.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Elon Musk Cheats at Video Games’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Don&#39;t Believe Him&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/dont-believe-him" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41542</id><published> 2025-02-03T15:37:24Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T17:27:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ezra Klein in an audio essay/transcribed column at The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> That is the tension at the heart of Trump&#39;s whole strategy: Trump is acting like a king because he is too weak to govern like a president. He is trying to substitute perception for reality. He is hoping that perception then becomes reality. That can only happen if we believe him. [...]</p><p> What Trump wants you to see in all this activity is command.所有这些活动中真正是混乱的。 They do not have some secret reservoir of focus and attention the rest of us do not. They have convinced themselves that speed and force is a strategy unto itself — that it is, in a sense, a replacement for a real strategy. Don&#39;t believe them.</p></blockquote><p> It is easy and quick, often instantaneous, to destroy things. It is hard and slow work to build new things, and often even harder and slower work to improve existing ones.</p><blockquote><p> I had a conversation a couple months ago with someone who knows how the federal government works about as well as anyone alive. I asked him what would worry him most if he saw Trump doing it. What he told me is that he would worry most if Trump went slowly. If he began his term by doing things that made him more popular and made his opposition weaker and more confused. If he tried to build strength for the midterms while slowly expanding his powers and chipping away at the deep state where it was weakest.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s the optimistic take — Trump and his new administration are trying to manically (or is it maniacally?) punch their way to a first-round knockout. They&#39;re utterly unprepared for a 15-round grueling slog. The pessimistic take is that the first-round knockout might happen.</p><p> The ultimate power in America isn&#39;t our political or legal systems. It&#39;s our culture. Our collective attitudes. We, collectively, are quite obviously very bad at history, because we, collectively, clearly forgot how chaotic a Trump presidency is <em>after just four years</em> , and we forgot how much we dislike chaotic leadership. But <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">we know what we don&#39;t like</a> and we&#39;re vocal about it.

<p>Parker Ortolani:</p><blockquote><p> Mastodon clients have become the new UI playground in the same way that Twitter clients used to be. But what I can&#39;t wrap my head around is the business decision of developers to lean into Mastodon clients versus Bluesky ones. Fortunately some progress seems to be starting to be made with apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740792786">PinkSky</a> that replicate the Instagram experience but using Bluesky as the backend. There are also a handful of clients like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6466340923">Skeets</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graysky-a-bluesky-client/id6448234181">GraySky</a> , but nothing that approaches the quality of some Mastodon clients or the legendary Twitter clients of old. They&#39;re okay, but they&#39;re not worth dropping the official client. Other apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1666230916">OpenVibe</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485">Reeder</a> are designed to combine feeds from multiple services and they do work with Bluesky. But they&#39;re not dedicated clients. I want Tweetbot or Twitterrific, but for Bluesky. I&#39;m not seeing that yet. The opportunity is clearly there, it has tens of millions of users making it three times the size of Mastodon.</p></blockquote><p> One thing all the existing nascent Bluesky clients lack is timeline position saving/sync — so when you leave the app and come back later (with sync, even on a different device) you can pick up reading exactly where you left off. I find it hard to imagine paying for a Bluesky client that didn&#39;t do this.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> About a month ago, Skeets developer Sebastian Vogelsang <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skeetsapp.com/post/3lfa32kfctc26">posted a thread about running into API limitations</a> trying to implement position-saving, a feature that&#39;s in beta, and available to Skeets Pro users.

<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">Editors note from The New Republic</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As The New Republic <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/191007/la-times-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trump">reported on Friday</a> , The Los Angeles Times — currently in a race to the bottom <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/188445/washington-post-bezos-trump-failure">with The Washington Post</a> to determine which of the two venerable institutions can sell out to Donald Trump the hardest — found itself in a fresh controversy after contributor Eric Reinhart accused the paper of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">making significant edits</a> to a piece of his that was largely critical of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. into one that depicted the president&#39;s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services with an “optimistic tone,” largely “suggesting that the virulent conspiracy theorist could be an answer and solution to the American public&#39;s bubbling resentment toward the health care industry.”</p><p> Reinhart exposed the shady goings-on on X (fka Twitter). “Editing out the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author&#39;s clear intent is pretty shitty,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericreinhart.bsky.social/post/3lh2ell45722u">he wrote</a> . In light of this lamentable journalistic malpractice, The New Republic has agreed to run Reinhart&#39;s piece as he intended it to be read.</p></blockquote><p> Reinhart&#39;s headline at TNR, encapsulating the intended thrust of his piece: “ <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">RFK Jr&#39;s Wrecking Ball Won&#39;t Fix Public Health</a> ”, and the closing paragraph of the column:</p><blockquote><p> Although RFK, Jr., and Luigi Mangione are both responses to the same underlying problem of US healthcare corruption, there is a major difference between them: one allegedly operated outside the law to kill one person in defense of millions, whereas the other — via his egomaniacal <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">disregard</a> for scientific evidence — seeks to use law itself to inflict preventable death on those millions.</p></blockquote><p> The headline the LA Times ran his piece under, after their editing: “ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">Trump&#39;s Healthcare Disruption Could Pay Off — if He Pushes Real Reform</a> ”, and its closing paragraphs:</p><blockquote><p> Such an approach would shift us away from overreliance on expensive medical treatments and toward public health as it should be: a project by and for <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/152/4/245/118232/Empowering-the-Extra-Ordinary">the people</a> that makes full use of government resources to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/02/24/fixing-public-health-systems-revolution-physicians-take-backseat/">empower communities</a> .</p><p> We should demand fundamental transformations in how we approach health in America, but a wrecking ball alone won&#39;t deliver what we need.</p></blockquote><p> After all the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post">shenanigans</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/owner-patrick-soon-shiong-is-tanking-the-la-times">Soon-Shiong began pulling</a> pre- <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/soon-shiong-la-times">and post-election</a> , my only question here is whether Reinhart really believed the LA Times op-ed page was going to run his piece as written.</p><h2> Super-Nerdy Bonus Material</h2><p> My original intention for this post ended above. I wanted to quote the TNR editors note that explained the situation, quote Reinhart&#39;s intended headline and closing paragraph, and contrast those with the benign gibberish headline and closing that the LA Times actually published.完毕。 But I&#39;ve got more. Turns out, the LA Times itself effectively published <em>proof</em> of its “editing” that completely perverted Reinhart&#39;s intended thrust.</p><p> I have a small arsenal of homegrown tools I use to automate the work of writing DF. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> itself is the crown jewel of them. But over the now many years I&#39;ve been doing this I&#39;ve created a whole toolbox of scripts and macros that help me do what I do faster and with fewer errors. (And I still commit plenty of errors.) One of the smaller ones that I&#39;ve never shared publicly (but probably <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/">should</a> ) is a Keyboard Maestro macro that lets me select a range of text in Safari and copy that selection as Markdown-formatted文本。 It picks up spans of italics and boldfacing, but most importantly, it picks up hyperlinks in the original text and converts them to the Markdown link style I prefer ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">defined reference links</a> ).</p><p> You will note in my blockquote above of Reinhart&#39;s intended closing paragraph, as published at The New Republic, he linked the word “disregard” to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">this January 28 report from The Washington Post</a> : “RFK Jr. Disparaged Vaccines Dozens of Times in Recent Years and Made Baseless Claims on Race”. No link to that Washington Post report appears, visually, in the butchered version of Reinhart&#39;s piece that ran in the LA Times.</p><p> But, my “Copy Markdown Blockquote” macro picked up an effectively invisible-to-the-user link to that article, in the HTML markup between their closing paragraph and Reinhart&#39;s author bio beneath it. You can view source at the LA Times website and see for yourself, but here&#39;s a screenshot:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/la-times-reinhart-html-screenshot.png" class="noborder"><img

<p>Alex Heath, writing at The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Moments after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s all-hands comments to employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/603754/mark-zuckerberg-tells-employees-to-buckle-up-in-leaked-all-hands-meeting">were widely leaked</a> , a company executive warned in an internal memo that leakers will be fired.</p><p> “We take leaks seriously and will take action,” Meta&#39;s chief information security officer, Guy Rosen, said in an internal memo I&#39;ve seen. [...] Rosen goes on to say that Meta “will take appropriate action, including termination” if it identifies leakers and that “we recently terminated relationships with employees who leaked confidential company information inappropriately and exfiltrated sensitive documents.”</p><p> During today&#39;s all-hands meeting, Zuckerberg told employees he would no longer be as transparent due to leaks. “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks,” he said. “It sucks.”</p></blockquote><p> Just about every well-run and successful company I&#39;m aware of fires leakers. Or really it&#39;s the opposite: it&#39;s difficult to succeed as a company with no institutional trust between employees. But company cultures are infused by the personalities of their founders. Meta employees have no scruples surrounding the privacy of internal communications because, by definition, they&#39;re the sort of people who never saw any problem with Meta&#39;s complete lack of regard for such things. So they don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lgykn4gqmk2v">leak what they don&#39;t like</a> . Zuck gets no loyalty because he hired an entire company of people with no convictions other than “winning” or whatever it really is that Meta sees as its central tenet.</p><p> It&#39;s not fear of getting fired that keeps employees at most companies from leaking. It&#39;s that they find themselves aligned with the company&#39;s mission. They feel like part of a team that they want to see succeed, and they naturally adopt an attitude of being a team player. Team players don&#39;t leak the playbook because they don&#39;t like the coach&#39;s play-calling or how much playing time they&#39;re getting. I&#39;ve never gotten the sense that that sort of attitude exists at Meta.</p><p> This is a company that bought a popular VPN app (Onavo) and then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat">used it to snoop on users&#39; encrypted SnapChat traffic</a> . They used it <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/10/facebook-copycatting">to snoop on users to determine the popularity of WhatsApp before purchasing it</a> . This wasn&#39;t some rogue operation in a corner of the company — it was a core strategic asset that led directly to a $20 billion acquisition. Onavo was just flat-out spyware and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/22/facebook-onavo-app-store">Apple kicked it out of the App Store in 2018</a> . For years — years — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/29/facebook-teens-vpn">Meta paid users aged 13–35 up to $20 a month to install a “Facebook Research” app</a> that let Meta study every single thing they did on their phones. An app like that couldn&#39;t be distributed through the App Store, of course, so Meta distributed it by abusing the iOS “enterprise” developer program; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facebook-and-google-offered-gift-cards-for-root-level-access-to-ios-users-data/">when Apple pulled Meta&#39;s enterprise certificate over the fiasco</a> , its employees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/30/apple-disables-facebook-internal-apps/">couldn&#39;t use their own internal apps to buy food or take a company shuttle bus</a> .</p><p> It would be a wonder if the sort of people who would do stuff like that — or go to work at a company that does things like that — were <em>not</em> incorrigible leakers of embarrassing information and communications. Zuck&#39;s exasperation over the disloyalty of his own employees is like hiring a team of pickpockets and then complaining that sandwiches keep going missing from the gang&#39;s hangout fridge.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Perfect Headline: ‘Meta Warns That It Will Fire Leakers in Leaked Memo’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/meta-warns-leakers-in-leaked-memo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The WSJ on Zuckerberg&#39;s $25 Million Payoff to Trump </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?st=mqxsa5&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/wsj-suck-trump-payoff" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41535</id><published> 2025-01-31T20:53:30Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T20:53:31Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Annie Linskey and Rebecca Ballhaus, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p><blockquote><p> “It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said in a statement. “After Meta pays to play, what does Mark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?”</p><p> Serious talks about the suit, which had seen little activity since fall 2023, began after Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s chief executive, flew to Trump&#39;s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to dine with him in November, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The dinner was one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the relationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump&#39;s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump warned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the election against him.</p><p> Toward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of the lawsuit, the people said. The president signaled that the litigation had to be resolved before Zuckerberg could be “brought into the tent,” one of the people said.</p></blockquote><p> A good reminder that self respect has no price tag.</p><blockquote><p> Weeks later, in early January, Zuckerberg returned to Mar-a-Lago for a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerberg-meta-trump-pivot-392e4a3f?mod=article_inline">full day of mediation</a> . Trump was present for part of the session, though he stepped out at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-sentencing-hush-money-new-york-9f9282bc?mod=article_inline">one point to be sentenced</a> — appearing virtually — for covering up hush money paid to a porn star, one of the people said. He also golfed, reappearing in golf clothes and talking about the round he had just played, the person said.</p></blockquote><p> Even when you own the golf course and <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/trump-drives-golf-cart-onto-green/">drive your cart right onto the green</a> like a jackass, an 18-hole round of golf still takes like three hours.

<p>Via David Smith on Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113923389557198608">who writes</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The recent work I&#39;ve been doing has required a lot of sharing files between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the ideal tool for this but I&#39;ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p><p> Instead I&#39;ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop alternative and it&#39;s been working fantastically. The only real downside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the share to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that&#39;s a tradeoff I&#39;ll happily make.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow I&#39;d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It&#39;s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229">in the App Store</a> and <a href="https://localsend.org/download">via the web</a> . No middleman in the cloud — transfers are peer-to-peer, and the whole project is <a href="https://localsend.org/community">open source with an active community on GitHub</a> .</p><p> When I dick around with my Android burner phone, I often find myself sorely missing AirDrop and Continuity. Sometimes I just want to move the contents of my clipboard from one device to the other — LocalSend makes that easier than anything else I&#39;ve seen.</p><p> I&#39;m not even sure Smith&#39;s “downside” is really a downside. I understand why AirDrop works the way it does (always-on in the background), but I wouldn&#39;t want LocalSend to work that way. I <em>like</em> the explicitness of opening it on both devices.</p><p> Just an outstanding project from developer Tien Do Nam.

<p>A Monday report from Reuters, syndicated at The Guardian, “Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, Trump Claims”:</p><blockquote><p> Donald Trump has suggested that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok and that he would like to see a bidding war over the app. When asked if Microsoft was in talks to buy the app, the US president said “I would say yes”, adding “A lot of interest in TikTok. There&#39;s great interest in TikTok.”</p><p> Microsoft, TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters&#39; requests for a comment outside regular business hours, after the US president&#39;s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday.</p><p> The reported talks mark the second time that Microsoft has been in the frame to acquire TikTok. During his first term, Trump ordered TikTok to separate its US version from ByteDance citing national security concerns. Microsoft emerged as a top bidder in 2020, but the talks soon collapsed, and Trump&#39;s divestment push ended a few months later when he left office.</p></blockquote><p> Is it really true that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok from ByteDance? Or did Donald Trump just bullshit his “I would say yes”? This report, based on nothing more than an off-the-cuff verbal answer from Trump Monday, has had absolutely zero follow-up since. Microsoft reported its quarterly earnings yesterday and there was not a word about a TikTok acquisition. And in the years since 2020, Microsoft has invested a staggering amount of capital into data centers for AI and cloud computing — their $22 billion spend last quarter and estimated $80 billion spend for the upcoming year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/microsoft-earnings-stock.html">dominated news coverage</a> and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">analysis</a> of their results yesterday. They also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">acquired Activision Blizzard</a> for about $70 billion. I&#39;m not saying Microsoft couldn&#39;t afford to acquire TikTok — they could, I&#39;m sure — but it&#39;d raise a genuine question about focus. But there&#39;s <em>nothing</em> <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">in the coverage of yesterday&#39;s results</a> or the analyst call they held that suggests they&#39;re in the hunt for TikTok.</p><p> Whether you love Trump or hate him (or, bizarrely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">somehow fall in-between</a> — please see me after class if you&#39;re of that mind) we all know he&#39;s a bullshitter. He makes shit up. Either (a) there are secret talks between Microsoft and ByteDance, and Trump is privy to those talks, and he decided to blab about them, but only when asked; or (b) he just said “I would say yes” when asked because he thought it would sound good and reinforce his self image as the world&#39;s most juiced-in dealmaker. I know which seems more likely.</p><p> And even if it&#39;s <em>not</em> bullshit, if all a news report has to go on is Donald Trump saying “I would say yes”, that <em>has</em> to be filed under “Maybe this is true” <em>at best</em> . So the headline, at its most generous, should put that first: “Trump Claims Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok”, not “Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, Trump Claims”.</p><p> Here&#39;s the kicker: Reuters&#39;s original headline, on reuters.com, actually got this right: “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-microsoft-is-talks-acquire-tiktok-2025-01-28/">Trump Says Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok</a> ”.

<p>Fascinating thread — and an almost entirely civil discussion of what has become, for obvious reasons, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">an inflammatory topic</a> . These are mapping and metadata nerds approaching the dilemma in the very nerdiest of ways. I found it rather soothing, and also quite informative — particularly the posts from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Minh%20Nguyen">Minh Nguyễn</a> , who seems to be an OpenStreetMap super user.<a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/55">第一的</a>：</p><blockquote><p> So it turns out the UNGEGN is not actually a decision-making authority on individual toponyms. Their role is to encourage and facilitate standardization. They literally issue <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/wgGuidelines.html">guidelines about guidelines</a> . The closest thing to an authority on the gulf&#39;s name <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265039137_The_Naming_of_Maritime_Features_Viewed_from_an_International_Law_Perspective">in international law</a> would be the International Hydrographic Organization. The IHO&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_Oceans_and_Seas"><em>Limits of Oceans and Seas</em></a> has been frozen in time without any updates since 1953, apparently because Japan and South Korea can&#39;t agree on a name for the sea separating them. Maybe a certain dealmaker can get them to the bargaining table…</p></blockquote><p> My kneejerk reaction to Trump&#39;s “Gulf of America” executive order was that mapmakers should just roll their eyes, make the jerk-off motion, and ignore it. But that&#39;s not practical. Mapmakers seek to appeal to authority on names.还有什么选择？ That Google and Apple (and OpenStreetMaps) serve as their own authorities on the names of topographical features and geographical points of interest?那是不对的。 So you might think, well, the Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water, so the mapmakers should appeal to an international authority. The UN! But as Nguyễn cites, that&#39;s not what the UN&#39;s Group of Experts on Geographical Names does.</p><p> <a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/87">Another post in the thread from Nguyễn</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Ironically, Spanish-language media <a href="https://elpais.com/us/2025-01-21/de-golfo-de-mexico-a-golfo-de-america-trump-renombra-el-mapa-aunque-con-improbables-consecuencias-internacionales.html/">keeps having to explain</a> why <em>Gulf of America</em> is problematic in English. In Spanish, <em>América</em> refers to the Americas as a whole, not the US specifically. If one didn&#39;t know any better, one would think it&#39;s a gift to Cuba! Of course, this doesn&#39;t justify the attempt to rename the gulf, since the intention is abundantly clear, but it does leave the name vulnerable to others reclaiming it for themselves. A more erudite politician might&#39;ve chosen <em>Gulf of Florida</em> , which at least has a historical basis, dating to around the same time as <em>Gulf of Mexico</em> .但是我们在这里。</p></blockquote><p> And from yet another post by Nguyễn, a link to <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12881">this new report on the order&#39;s implications for the entire federal government</a> from the Congressional Research Service (a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress). Now we&#39;ve gotten more good nerds involved: librarians. And whatever the answer is, it&#39;s complicated.</p><p> I don&#39;t like this ostensible renaming (rebranding?) of the Gulf of Mexico any more than you do. It&#39;s petty and pointless, except for the trolling spite, which, of course, <em>is</em> the point. I don&#39;t know what Apple is going to do, but I suspect, ultimately, if the Department of the Interior really does make this official, Apple Maps will follow suit, but perhaps with something like “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” for users in the US.</p><p> Google should have simply done what Apple is doing, though, and remained utterly silent on the issue until and if it&#39;s actually made official. Best thing we can hope for is that the Department of the Interior stalls on making the change in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and that Trump forgets about it by then.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘OpenStreetMap Community Discussion on How to Handle the U.S. Federal Government’s Imminent Designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘Gulf of America’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/29/open-street-map-gulf-of-mexico">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/repebble" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1l" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41529</id><published> 2025-01-29T21:57:23Z</published><updated> 2025-01-30T22:05:11Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The whole tech world needs more projects that aren&#39;t trying to become billion- (let alone trillion-) dollar ideas, but are happily shooting for success as million-dollar ideas (or less!). </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>David Pierce, writing at The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24352968/pebble-smartwatch-open-source-google-comeback">The Pebble Smartwatch Is Making a Comeback</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Rather than buy another smartwatch, Migicovsky decided to try and get Pebble going again. He <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging">sold his most recent startup</a> , a messaging app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998294/beeper-imessage-apple-app-security">called Beeper</a> , to Automattic last year and left the company in the fall. Since then, he&#39;d thought about starting a Pebble-like product from scratch, figuring it&#39;d be easier to do the same thing again a second time. “But then I was like, <em>what if I just asked Google to open-source the operating system</em> ?”他说。 It felt like a long shot, but he knew the code was just sitting dormant inside Mountain View somewhere. So he asked. A few times.</p><p> To Migicovsky&#39;s surprise, Google agreed to release Pebble OS to the public. As of Monday, <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html">all the Pebble firmware is available on GitHub</a> , and Migicovsky is starting a company to pick up where he left off.</p><p> The company — which can&#39;t be named Pebble because Google still owns that — doesn&#39;t have a name yet.</p></blockquote><p> My first idea for a new name: Rebble — a rebellious return of Pebble. My second idea: Quixote — because this isn&#39;t going to be a hit this time either. (Quixote also would have been a good name for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her">Beeper Mini&#39;s attempt to backwards engineer</a> access <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_mini_is_back">as an unsanctioned iMessage client for Android</a> .) But, thankfully, it doesn&#39;t sound to me like Migicovsky&#39;s goal is to boil the ocean. ( <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out, <a href="https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html">Rebble is the name of a community project</a> to write new firmware to keep old Pebble watches running.)</p><p> <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back">Migicovsky, on his blog</a> :</p><blockquote><p> You&#39;d <em>imagine</em> that smartwatches have evolved considerably since 2012. I&#39;ve tried every single smart watch out there, but none do it for me. No one makes a smartwatch with the core set of features I want:</p><ul><li> <em>Always-on e-paper screen</em> (it&#39;s reflective rather than emissive. Sunlight readable. Glanceable. Not distracting to others like a bright wrist)</li><li> <em>Long battery life</em> (one less thing to charge. It&#39;s annoying to need extra cables when traveling)</li><li> <em>Simple and beautiful user experience</em> around a core set of features I use regularly (telling time, notifications, music control, alarms, weather, calendar, sleep/step tracking)</li><li> <em>Buttons!</em> (to play/pause/skip music on my phone without looking at the screen)</li><li> <em>Hackable</em> (apparently you can&#39;t even write your own watchfaces for Apple Watch? That is wild. There were >;16k watchfaces on the Pebble appstore!)</li></ul></blockquote><p> If their goal is to be to smartwatches what <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> is to handheld gaming, that&#39;s definitely achievable, and if they succeed, will by definition be a lot of fun.</p><p> The whole tech world needs more projects that aren&#39;t trying to become billion- (let alone trillion‑) dollar ideas, but are happily shooting for success as million-dollar ideas (or less!). Many of the best and most beloved movies ever made weren&#39;t big-budget Hollywood blockbusters. If your list of all-time favorite movies doesn&#39;t include a bunch that were made on shoestring budgets, your whole list probably sucks, because you have no taste. The same is of course true for music, games, and everything else. Indie art is often <em>great</em> art, imbued by the souls and obsessions of its creators, and blockbuster art is often garbage art, imbued only by soulless corporate bureaucracies.</p><p> Computer hardware and software can be — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/11/make-something-wonderful">ought to be</a> — attempts at creating art.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★Pebble创始人Eric Migicovsky将其带回</title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/my_spitball_theory_on_tiktoks_current_semi-reprieve_in_the_us" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1j" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41527</id><published> 2025-01-29T02:13:53Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T14:48:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user&#39;s phone continues to function, that user can&#39;t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance&#39;s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#39;s an addendum to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">my post yesterday</a> on the recent shake-up atop the generally stable “top free downloads” list in the App Store. Some of the shake-up is from new entrants, like the much-ballyhooed AI chatbot DeepSeek. But a lot of it is the direct result of the sudden absence of ByteDance&#39;s entire lineup of apps: TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap. Alternatives are vying to fill those voids. [ <strong>Update, one day later:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/marvel-snap-returns-to-app-store/">Marvel Snap is back in the App Store</a> , because it now has a new publisher.]</p><p> TikTok returning to operational service in the US <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">after an outage of just one day</a> has squelched the outrage surrounding its ban. The app stopped working; TikTok users, unprepared for its ban, freaked out; the app started working again the next day; and TikTok fans more or less went back to scrolling their feeds and shut up. Controversy over.</p><p> But the controversy shouldn&#39;t be over. And unless something changes, it&#39;s going to slowly simmer back to an eventual boil.</p><p> Nobody is really talking about the fact that ByteDance apps remain banned, legally speaking, in the US right now, and already-installed copies of their apps are only continuing to function because TikTok&#39;s US cloud providers, Oracle and Akamai, restored service on the word of President Trump that they won&#39;t be held accountable for doing so, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">despite being in clear violation of the PAFACA Act</a> . But neither Apple nor Google has restored any of ByteDance&#39;s apps to the App Store or Play Store. That hasn&#39;t interfered with TikTok going back to operational via copies of the app already installed on users&#39; phones, but it&#39;s an insurmountable — although incremental — problem in the long run.</p><p> The conventional wisdom is that Oracle and Akamai are being a bit reckless (“ <em>If Trump says we&#39;re good, we&#39;re good — what could go wrong, it&#39;s not like Trump has ever changed his mind...</em> ”) and Apple and Google are prudent, more staid (“ <em>We&#39;re following the letter of the law and will continue to follow the letter of the law</em> ”). And perhaps that&#39;s all there is to this. But now that we&#39;re over a week into this post-ban period, I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s purely a coincidence that these four companies split along these lines. The two cloud providers required for TikTok to function on one side, the two app store providers on the other.</p><p> With TikTok&#39;s cloud provider access shut off, it was like a guillotine. TikTok was working for everyone in the US, then boom, it was shut down for everyone. Then, just as suddenly, it was back.</p><p> Being locked out of the App Store and Play Store, on the other hand, is a slow squeeze. The first thing that comes to mind, obviously, is no new users. No growth. TikTok already has a mind-boggling number of users in the US (estimates seem to range from 120 to 170 million), but no growth is no growth.</p><p> The second thing that comes to mind is no app updates for US users. No new features. No bug fixes. No security patches. TikTok, like most popular apps, typically pushes updates to the App Store and Play Store every two or three weeks. What happens now that that&#39;s stopped for US users? Is ByteDance still going to push app updates to users in the rest of the world? TikTok obviously has a lot of American users but <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/data-drop-5-charts-on-tiktoks-growth-asia-pacific"><em>most</em> of its users live elsewhere</a> .</p><p> But the third factor is the most insidious: even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user&#39;s phone continues to function, that user can&#39;t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance&#39;s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores. Wipe and restore your phone from backup? No more TikTok. Buy a new phone? No TikTok on the new phone.</p><p> Trump&#39;s reprieve was a declaration that the Justice Department wouldn&#39;t enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance doesn&#39;t sell TikTok — and it sure doesn&#39;t seem like they have any more intention to sell it now than they did before the ban took effect — what happens? <em>Another</em> (even more shambolically illegal) Trump extension that only keeps TikTok functioning, but not available in the app stores? Because the other side isn&#39;t budging either: China hawks like Senator Tom Cotton <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/speeches/icymi-cotton-objects-to-tiktok-ban-extension">have not shifted an inch</a> . They&#39;re tolerating Trump&#39;s 75-day reprieve but not budging from their overall “sell or you&#39;re banned” stance.</p><p> I&#39;m not saying this is a backroom plot between the administration and these companies, but I&#39;m not saying it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a backroom agreement either. Trump isn&#39;t complaining about Apple and Google not getting on board. And neither Apple nor Google seems worried about Trump&#39;s wrath for not following Oracle and Akamai&#39;s leads. The goal of the legislation isn&#39;t to pull the plug on TikTok for Americans — it&#39;s to pressure ByteDance (and really, their bosses in the Chinese Communist Party) into selling the app. Instantly banning TikTok&#39;s US operations resulted in instant and vociferous outrage from TikTok users — the pressure turned out not to be on ByteDance and the CCP, it was on the US government to give people back their beloved TikTok. So I think everyone on the US side is looking at the current detente — TikTok being available to existing users through existing copies of the app, but not being available in app stores — as a way to turn the pressure up only on ByteDance. Slowly strangle TikTok over a period of months, rather than behead it overnight.</p><p> But what happens if the CCP stands pat? If they just wait it out? If ByteDance were a normal company they&#39;d face financial pressure to capitulate and sell. But the CCP isn&#39;t under any financial pressure to allow ByteDance to sell. Say what you will about the Chinese government, but they do not lack for patience. What happens then, when word starts spreading amongst TikTok fans not to upgrade their phones, lest they lose access to the app? Apple&#39;s going to have some strong feelings about that.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ My Spitball Theory on TikTok&#39;s Current Semi-Reprieve in the US</title></entry><entry><title> Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to &#39;Gulf of America&#39;, for American Users Only </title><link href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41526</id><published> 2025-01-29T01:00:22Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T22:12:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

[...]</p><p> Some team members within the maps division were ordered to urgently make changes to the location name and recategorize the US from “non-sensitive” to “sensitive,” according to the internal correspondence. The changes were given a rare “P0” order, meaning it had the highest priority level and employees were immediately notified and instructed to drop what they were doing to work on it.</p><p> Google&#39;s order states that the Gulf of America title change should be treated similar to the Persian Gulf, which in Arab countries is displayed on Google Maps as Arabian Gulf.</p></blockquote><p> No word from Apple on how Apple Maps will handle this.

<p>Sarah Perez, TechCrunch “ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/automattic-and-others-back-openvibe-an-app-thats-unifying-the-open-social-web/">Automattic and Others Back Openvibe, an App That&#39;s Unifying the Open Social Web</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/openvibe-combines-mastodon-bluesky-and-nostr-into-one-social-app/">Launched in 2024</a> , Openvibe initially supported three of the more prominent open social networks, all of which operate using different protocols: Mastodon uses ActivityPub, Bluesky runs on AT Protocol, and Nostr powers a number of third-party apps. Openvibe later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/cross-posting-social-app-openvibe-now-supports-threads-too/">added support for Instagram Threads</a> , as that app became further integrated with ActivityPub and opened itself up to the developer community.</p><p> As CEO Matej Svancer explained at the time, the idea behind his app was to offer users a more friendly and “easy-to-use gateway” to the open social web. Because of the different protocols these networks utilize, it can be difficult for newcomers who end up having to switch apps or limit their engagement to just their preferred platform.</p><p> But Openvibe doesn&#39;t just let people stay connected with friends across all these services in a combined timeline, it also allows cross-posting to multiple networks at once.</p></blockquote><p> I just gave it a try, and my take is that <a href="https://openvibe.social/">Openvibe</a> is definitely interesting, but it&#39;s not for me, and I&#39;m not really sure who it <em>is</em> for. I signed into all three of my personal accounts that Openvibe supposedly supports: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo">Bluesky</a> , <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">Mastodon</a> , and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber">Threads</a> . I got a home timeline that mashes together all the posts from my Bluesky and Mastodon accounts. I don&#39;t see any errors related to Threads, but I don&#39;t see any posts from Threads. That kind of makes sense because Threads doesn&#39;t offer an API that allows for full third-party clients. Threads does have an API for posting, so I presume my Threads account in Openvibe is write-only. Openvibe&#39;s website and the app itself make it seem like I should see content from my Threads timeline, though. (Perhaps I don&#39;t because <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113635727167100815">I turned off “fediverse sharing”</a> with my Threads account a few weeks ago — <em>because</em> I prefer keeping these networks separate. But if that&#39;s the problem, Openvibe doesn&#39;t explain that I need to re-enable it ）</p><p> I really don&#39;t see the point of mashing the tweets from two (or more!) different social networks into one unified timeline. To me it&#39;s just confusing. I don&#39;t love the current situation where three entirely separate, thriving social networks each merit some portion of my attention (not to mention that a fourth, X, still kinda does too). But when I use each of these platforms, I want to use a client that is dedicated to each platform. These platforms all have different features, to varying degrees, and they definitely have different vibes and cultural norms. Pretending that they all form one big (lowercase-m) meta platform doesn&#39;t make that pretense cohesive. Mashing them all together in one timeline isn&#39;t simpler. It <em>sounds</em> simpler but in practice it&#39;s more cacophonous.</p><p> The idea that this might in any way appeal to “newcomers” is bananas to me. The concept of streaming multiple accounts from multiple networks into one timeline is by definition a bit advanced. In my experience, for very obvious reasons, casual social network users only use the first-party client. They&#39;re confused even by the idea of using, say, an app named <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> to access a social network called Mastodon. The idea of explaining to them why they might want to use an app named Openvibe to access Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads (and the weirdo blockchain network Nostr) is like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dwread/32464548110">trying to explain to your dog why they should stay out of the trash</a> . There&#39;s a market for third-party clients (or at least I hope there is), but that market is not made up of “newcomers”.</p><p> Also, Openvibe is not a good app. It doesn&#39;t look great, the custom font is somewhat cartoon-y (which I find both unattractive and off-putting), there&#39;s a lot of gray-on-white low-contrast iconography and text, and, worst of all, it seems to update your feeds periodically and when it does, it refreshes and scrolls the timeline <em>while you&#39;re looking at it</em> . It&#39;s like having a book turn the page automatically while you&#39;re reading in the middle of a page. When you leave and come back to the app a few minutes later, the timeline needs to reload, which contributes to the app feeling pretty slow. The overall look, feel, and layout says “generic Twitter-style social network”.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/openvibe-screenshot.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

<p>Jim Acosta, signing off from CNN for the final time:</p><blockquote><p>这绝不是屈服于暴君的好时机。 I believe it is the job of the press to hold power to account — I&#39;ve always tried to do that here at CNN, and I plan on doing all of that again in the future.</p><p> One final message: Don&#39;t give in to the lies.不要屈服于恐惧。 Hold on to the truth, and hope.</p></blockquote><p> President Trump, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113906705175756002">gloating</a> on his very popular social network, Truth Social (current ranking in the App Store: not in the top 200 free downloads, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/truth-social-app-store-2025-01-28.png">#20 in Social Networking</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Wow, really good news! Jim Acosta, one of the worst and most dishonest reporters in journalistic history, a major sleazebag, has been relegated by CNN Fake News to the Midnight hour, “Death Valley,” because of extraordinarily BAD RATINGS (and no talent!). Word is that he wants to QUIT, and that would be even better. Jim is a major loser who will fail no matter where he ends up. Good luck Jim!</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@aaron.rupar/post/DFIpGsKgXdb">Here&#39;s a recent example of Acosta&#39;s exemplary work on CNN</a> , interviewing Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee:</p><blockquote><p> ACOSTA: Do you agree with Trump&#39;s decision to pardon violent people?</p><p>代表。 BURCHETT: If they were truly violent, no.

We&#39;re showing the footage right now.</p></blockquote><p> Oliver Darcy, the former CNN media reporter now working under his own umbrella at Status, has been all over the abject cowardice of CNN&#39;s current chief executive, Mark Thompson:</p><blockquote><p> The anchor, I&#39;m told, signaled to associates in private conversations over the weekend that he intends to depart the network after its chief executive, Mark Thompson, booted him from the morning programming lineup — a move that conspicuously coincided with Donald Trump&#39;s return to力量。</p><p> CNN brass, <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jim-acosta-cnn-mark-thompson-midnight-offer">as we first reported earlier this month</a> , decided to strip Acosta of his 10am show, which he has anchored to great ratings success over the last 11 months, at times even seeing higher viewership than programs in the channel&#39;s prime time bloc.</p><p> Acosta was instead offered the less-than-desirable option of anchoring a show from midnight until 2am ET.</p><p> CNN pitched the gig to Acosta as anchoring during prime time on the West Coast and said he could move to Los Angeles to host the program. But the reality is the program would have aired at a time in which cable news viewership is at its lowest levels.</p></blockquote><p> Acosta&#39;s morning ratings were high, not low.

<p>MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass:</p><blockquote><p> Anyway, this matters because it doesn&#39;t mean that DeepSeek, an app based off of the Chinese-developed AI model of the same name, is the most popular app ever despite its current place atop the charts. Your mom probably isn&#39;t downloading it. Just as last week, your mom probably wasn&#39;t <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-042-tiktok-twitter/#:~:text=%2D%2D%20Candacce%2C,in%20social%20media.">downloading Xiaohongshu</a> (&#39; <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-043-bromo-sapiens/#:~:text=%F0%9F%95%9A%20TikTok%20Prepares,%3F%20%5BInformation%20%F0%9F%94%92%5D">Little Red Book</a> &#39;), incidentally another Chinese app that rose to the top of the charts. But it is still interesting because again, the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure, new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right now, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from Google (Google) in the top 10.</p><p> Instead, we have the aforementioned DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Paramount+, Temu, Fox Sports, Bluesky, ReelShort, and VPN rounding out the top 10. It&#39;s pretty easy to see why each of these has risen: interest in AI, interest in sports around the NFL playoffs, interest in Twitter-like social networks given <a href="https://spyglass.org/a-time-to-kill-twitter/">the Xitter situation</a> , and yes, <a href="https://spyglass.org/twittertok/">the TikTok ban</a> .</p></blockquote><p> The specific reasons are varied, but altogether it really is true that, for the moment at least, there&#39;s a serious shakeup atop the App Store top free downloads list. That&#39;s interesting for several reasons.</p><p> DeepSeek is at #1 and ChatGPT #2. That&#39;s great for “AI” but a bad look for OpenAI at the moment. I can&#39;t help but think that DeepSeek having rocketed to the top spot, seemingly ( <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1226">but not actually</a> ) out of nowhere helped drive today&#39;s stock market reaction. (Google Gemini is down at #14.)</p><p> Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple&#39;s strength in AI. Sure, Apple&#39;s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">pretty embarrassing</a> right now, even <em>with</em> its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson&#39;s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/wwdc-apple-intelligence-apple-aggregates-ai/">reinforces Apple&#39;s role as an aggregator of AI</a> . The measuring stick for consumer AI products <em>and</em> public social media networks is where they&#39;re listed on the App Store. Not app stores, lowercase. <em>The</em> App Store. Apple&#39;s. That&#39;s The Show, the Major Leagues. So sure, it&#39;d be better for Apple users and Apple shareholders, and thus better for Apple itself, if Apple&#39;s own AI was at least sort of kind of competitive, rather than the butt of jokes. Aside from the easily forgotten iTunes Ping 15 years ago, Apple hasn&#39;t even <em>tried</em> to offer its own public broadcast-style social media platform. But the iPhone is <em>the</em> place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn&#39;t matter if Comcast&#39;s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut.</p><p> Lastly, when it comes to Meta: Threads is #3 (the people arguing that Threads is a bust sure are quiet lately), Instagram is down to #16 (not great if they were hoping for a bounce from TikTok&#39;s questionable future), WhatsApp #17 (not bad on iOS in the US, where iMessage is strongest) and Facebook is ... scroll, scroll, scroll ... #32, just behind Walmart and Microsoft Teams. 32 isn&#39;t that far ahead of X, which clocks in at #41. Facebook might never die, but we seem to be watching it fade away.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Shakeup in the App Store Top Downloads List’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CNBC: &#39;Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China&#39;s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off&#39; </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-chinas-deepseek-triggers-global-tech-sell-off.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41519</id><published> 2025-01-27T22:15:20Z</published><updated> 2025-01-28T16:51:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jenni Reid and Alex Harring, reporting for CNBC:</p><blockquote><p> Nvidia and other US technology firms plunged on Monday, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America&#39;s leadership in the sector.</p><p> Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, last slid 17.3%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020.</p></blockquote><p> To make a long story short, it&#39;s been broadly assumed that leading-edge model training <em>and</em> inference requires the highest of high-end hardware — which hardware, especially for training, pretty much exclusively comes from Nvidia. The assumption was that any company trying to compete in this fiercely competitive field — a field with massive implications for industry, culture, and national security — must get in line to buy (or rent) enormous amounts of computational power exclusively available on the very best systems from Nvidia. That hardware isn&#39;t available (at least legally) to Chinese companies, because of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/u-s-targets-china-with-new-ai-curbs-overriding-nvidias-objections-d1e06807">the Biden administration&#39;s export bans</a> . DeepSeek engineers found and implemented multiple massive efficiency improvements that allowed the company to train its latest models at far lower prices using far-less-capable hardware, and perform <a href="https://www.vectara.com/glossary-of-llm-terms#llm-inference">inference</a> under heretofore unprecedented memory constraints. DeepSeek&#39;s achievements render obsolete several prior planks of conventional wisdom regarding the state of AI. My link a few sentences prior in this paragraph is to a WSJ report from 14 days ago that now feels like it dates from at least 14 <em>months</em> ago.</p><p> The most shocking result has been a 17 percent hit to Nvidia&#39;s stock price today, knocking somewhere around $350 <em>billion</em> off their market cap. Google is down about 4 percent, and Microsoft down 2 percent — but Meta is up 1 percent and Apple is up a little over 3 percent. I think the market is reacting pretty sensibly:</p><ul><li><p> Nvidia has taken an unprecedented beating. $350 billion is more than the combined market caps of Verizon <em>and</em> AT&amp;T (each worth roughly $170 billion). But Nvidia has been — and even with these breakthroughs from DeepSeek, remains — in an unprecedented position. Nvidia&#39;s high-flying valuation reflects its unprecedented position as <em>the</em> essential hardware company for AI. Nvidia&#39;s position, post-R1, remains essential — just not <em>as</em> essential as everyone thought. Hence the haircut. But Nvidia <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">remains</a> the third-most-valuable company in the world — it took a massive plunge today but in no way collapsed.</p></li><li><p> TSMC and Broadcom both took big hits today too (-13% and -17%, respectively). Being a “chip company” doesn&#39;t look as sweet today as it did last week.</p></li><li><p> If OpenAI were publicly traded, I suspect it might have collapsed — the sell-off it would have faced today might have triggered emergency measures that halted trading.</p></li><li><p> Microsoft has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/">distancing itself from OpenAI</a> , but is still intertwined with them like no other company. (Recall that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/28/wsj-openai-apple">Apple walked away from a big investment in OpenAI</a> just four months ago.) A -2% hit feels about right.</p></li><li><p> The broadest implication of DeepSeek&#39;s achievements is that really good AI is going to be even cheaper and more openly available than expected — sooner than expected. That&#39;s bad news for Google, whose entire enterprise value is based around their having an unassailable and sustainable lead in these areas. Google doesn&#39;t have to worry about <em>a</em> competitor coming along to rival them in search. They have to worry that the entire field of “search” is on the cusp of being commoditized. Thus the -4% hit.</p></li><li><p> Meta, the thinking goes, benefits as generative AI becomes cheaper. That&#39;s why Meta&#39;s own AI efforts are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40078025">sorta-kinda open source</a> . Meta has nothing to do with DeepSeek, but DeepSeek&#39;s achievements seem perfectly aligned with Meta&#39;s own interests in AI.</p></li><li><p> Apple benefits, indirectly, in at least two ways from DeepSeek&#39;s breakthroughs. First, a vast increase in the inference capabilities of RAM-constrained hardware strongly suggests that Apple&#39;s consumer devices will soon be able to perform far more AI computation locally. Apple Silicon&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686">shared memory architecture</a> is perfect for this — and still un-replicated by anyone else in the industry. Second, Apple&#39;s decades-long <a href="https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/10/13/apple-vs-nvidia-what-happened.html">standoffish relationship with Nvidia</a> suddenly looks like less of a problem.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘CNBC: ‘Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China’s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Ben Thompson&#39;s DeepSeek FAQ </title><link href="https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41518</id><published> 2025-01-27T21:19:29Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T21:45:54Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese AI lab DeepSeek <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/">made waves last week</a> when they dropped their new “open reasoning” LLM named R1. But over the weekend the full repercussions of their achievements (plural) began to sink in across the industry. My partner-in-Dithering Ben Thompson has written an extraordinarily helpful FAQ-style explanation at Stratechery today. If you, like me, were looking at the news today and thinking “Jeebus what the hell is going on with this DeepSeek thing?”, read Thompson&#39;s piece first. Two choice excerpts, first regarding OpenAI:</p><blockquote><p>但是，R1是值得注意的，因为O1独自一人是市场上唯一的推理模型，并且是Openai是市场领导者的最明显迹象。</p><p> R1 undoes the o1 mythology in a couple of important ways. First, there is the fact that it exists. OpenAI does not have some sort of special sauce that can&#39;t be replicated. Second, R1 — like all of DeepSeek&#39;s models — has open weights (the problem with saying “open source” is that we don&#39;t have the data that went into creating it).这意味着，您可以在选择的服务器上甚至在本地以较低的成本在选择的服务器上运行R1，而不是支付OpenAi来获得推理。</p></blockquote><p> Second, regarding DeepSeek&#39;s use of <a href="https://snorkel.ai/blog/llm-distillation-demystified-a-complete-guide/">distillation</a> (using existing LLMs to train new smaller ones):</p><blockquote><p> Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves.我们正在观察AI起飞场景的组装。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ben Thompson’s DeepSeek FAQ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Removes &#39;2024&#39; Timeframe From Next-Generation CarPlay Page </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-removes-2024-from-next-gen-carplay-page/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41517</id><published> 2025-01-27T16:58:16Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T16:58:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jessica Lessin, writing for The Information back in 2014:</p><blockquote><p> Ms. Vorrath, who has worked on all seven iOS releases, generally operates by asking lots of questions of engineers, sticking to the facts and getting them to explain in plain English why a particular feature should be included in the operating system. She&#39;s easy to get along with, say former colleagues, who recall playfully mocking her 1990s feathered hairstyle and late 1980s fashion sense. But she isn&#39;t known for chitchat and has been known to “blow up” on occasion when people miss deadlines or make excuses, colleagues say.</p><p> During a tense time before the first release of iOS software in 2007, Ms. Vorrath grew irate when a colleague was heading home early before another marathon weekend meeting. She slammed her office door so hard that the door knob broke, and she locked herself in. Mr. Forstall grabbed a baseball bat to try to break her out, people who worked at Apple at the time recall. Mr. Forstall didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment.</p></blockquote><p> My understanding — from someone on the team — is that Forstall <em>did</em> bust her out, smashing the doorknob off with the bat. Every good software team needs a baseball bat.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jessica Lessin’s 2014 Profile of Kim Vorrath’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/lessin-vorrath">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Moves Kim Vorrath to Siri / Apple Intelligence Team </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-24/apple-enlists-company-veteran-kim-vorrath-to-help-fix-ai-and-siri" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w14" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/vorrath-siri-apple-intelligence" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41512</id><published> 2025-01-25T01:19:55Z</published><updated> 2025-02-05T14:40:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman has an interesting scoop at Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.</p><p> Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple&#39;s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She&#39;ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn&#39;t been announced publicly. [...]</p><p> Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple&#39;s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow Vorrath&#39;s name has never before appeared on Daring Fireball, but she&#39;s renowned within Apple, legendary even, for her leadership role in managing the creation and development of the software for the original iPhone, effectively serving as Scott Forstall&#39;s chief of staff. Her reputation is that she&#39;s a great manager — she gets shit done, knows how to ship, and talented people enjoy and thrive working for her. But outside Apple she&#39;s largely flown under the radar — which only emphasizes how much of an Apple person&#39;s Apple person she is.</p><p> I checked with a source who&#39;s worked with Vorrath for years, and their comment says it all: “She kicks all the asses.”</p><blockquote><p> The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.</p></blockquote><p> My sense is that it&#39;s less about Siri and Apple Intelligence being more important than VisionOS, and more about Siri being a mess. More about urgency than importance. But perhaps it&#39;s <em>both</em> more urgent and more important long-term. Either way, assigning Vorrath — perhaps Apple&#39;s best fixer — makes sense. As <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">my piece yesterday illustrated</a> , something is rotten in the state of SiriLand.</p><p> Also very interesting: Gurman citing “a longtime Apple executive” as his source. Not “a source familiar with the matter”, but “a longtime Apple executive”. No “former” in there either. Apple generally doesn&#39;t want personnel changes made public, but this one, I think is an exception. Siri is terrible, far behind the competition, and everyone from Cupertino to Wall Street knows it.</p><p> Apple sending in Kim Vorrath is like Marsellus Wallace sending in Winston Wolfe.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Moves Kim Vorrath to Siri / Apple Intelligence Team’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/vorrath-siri-apple-intelligence">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w10" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/01/fucking_amazon_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41508</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-01-23T00:05:39Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:05:40Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>苹果：</p><blockquote><p> Click the amount you wish to contribute, then click Donate and Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires.</p></blockquote><p> Apple has prominent links to its Red Cross donation form on the web and in the App Store. They&#39;ve been doing this after catastrophes and disasters <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/27/nepal-red-cross-itunes">around the world</a> for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/13/red-cross">a long time</a> . On the surface, it&#39;s great because it&#39;s so easy. Apple already has your saved credentials so it takes just a few taps or clicks to donate. You can measure the time to donate in seconds, not minutes.</p><p> But an under-appreciated aspect of Apple acting as a front-end to the Red Cross is that your donation remains completely private. There&#39;s quite a lot of small print on the donation screen, which starts:</p><blockquote><p> Because Apple is not sharing your personal information with the American Red Cross, the American Red Cross is unable to further acknowledge your donation. You will receive an email receipt from Apple, which will serve as the only record of your donation. The donation will also appear on your credit card statement as a transaction with Apple. You do not purchase any goods or receive any services from Apple by making a donation. Any donation collected by Apple is collected in the name, and on behalf, of the American Red Cross. This donation may not qualify for any tax deduction or other tax benefits. By donating through Apple, you acknowledge that any tax consequences to you in making the donation (including, but not limited to, ensuring you have sufficient documentation to claim any applicable tax deduction) shall be your responsibility. Apple Account credit cannot be used to make a donation. Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires (including Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Kern, Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial Counties).</p></blockquote><p> This sounds like a bunch of ignorable legalese but what it really means is quite interesting. You&#39;re not giving to the Red Cross through this. You&#39;re giving money to Apple, and Apple will then transfer 100 percent of it to the Red Cross. I&#39;m almost certain, for example, that Apple is covering the cost of the card transaction fees.</p><p> By donating this way, you will never get junk mail, email, or text messages from the Red Cross, or from any “partner” of the Red Cross, soliciting additional donations, because the Red Cross will never get your name, address, or数字。 All they get is your money.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/28/messages-political-spam">Back in August I wrote about</a> how my political solicitations via SMS had gotten so out of control, so downright annoying, that my wife and I had scaled back our donations to political campaigns, because it was obvious that previous campaigns we had donated to had shared or sold our information. We&#39;d been put on a Suckers List.</p><p> The same thing, sadly, happens with charities. People generally don&#39;t want to admit to selfishness, but I will. When I give money to a charitable cause, I always look for the checkboxes to opt out of being contacted by them in the future. When it happens anyway, I get annoyed, and I become reluctant to give to that charity again. And because it has happened repeatedly, it&#39;s made me at least somewhat more reluctant to give to <em>any</em> charitable cause in the first place. I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling that way.</p><p> When you donate to the Red Cross via Apple, that concern is off the table. Apple won&#39;t emphasize that aspect of this, because they don&#39;t want to throw the Red Cross under the proverbial bus, but I will. An underrated aspect of privacy is the desire simply not to be annoyed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Southern California Wildfire Relief: Consider Donating to the Red Cross Through Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/apple-red-cross-socal-fire-relief">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Ship That Leaks From the Top Is Back </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.rE4.mJTz.1TTdhPOAPRw-&amp;smid=url-share" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41506</id><published> 2025-01-22T21:41:08Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:53:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From a multi-byline profile of Stephen Miller in The New York Times last week:</p><blockquote><p> Mr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J. Trump&#39;s terms. He made clear that Mr. Trump would crack down on immigration and go to war against the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, culture that had been embraced by Meta and much of corporate America in recent years.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg was amenable. He signaled to Mr. Miller and his colleagues, including other senior Trump advisers, that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting, who asked for anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would instead focus solely on building tech products.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees&#39; self-expression in the workplace, according to one of the people with knowledge of the meeting. He said new guidelines and a series of layoffs amounted to a reset and that more changes were coming.</p></blockquote><p> This account of the meeting clearly leaked from Trump&#39;s side, not Meta&#39;s side. The tone of it is that Miller told Zuckerberg to jump, and that Zuck obsequiously and gladly responded “How high?”</p><p> Zuckerberg scrambled for cover, posting a “Sheryl did amazing work at Meta and will forever be a legend in the industry [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DE8CZDKSPkw">tweet to Threads</a> , followed by a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lfxlauieic2f">coordinated</a> “Thank you, @zuck. I will always be grateful for the many years we spent building a great business together [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/DE8GHndSWq4">reply from Sandberg</a> . (Sandberg, who left Meta in 2022, only posted <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/C6OdV4Zr6pf">once</a> to Threads in all of 2024. There&#39;s a good chance this will be her only post in 2025.)</p><p> Zuckerberg, politically, seems in way over his head. The first Trump administration was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-trump-aide-says-witnessed-kellyanne-conway-leaking-information-media-220749233.html">infamous for its leaks</a> . They barely hid it. The whole Trump brand is about brazenness. For decades, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/13/trump-john-miller">Trump was known to call reporters in New York under the guise of “John Miller” or “John Barron”</a> , who were ostensibly public relations spokesmen representing Trump. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_used_by_Donald_Trump">it was just him</a> — and he didn&#39;t even disguise his voice. He just did it.</p><p> So of course Stephen Miller (or Miller&#39;s equivalent of John Barron) leaked the confidential nature of his discussion with Zuckerberg to The New York Times, because it made Miller look dominating and Zuckerberg look dominated. Even though it&#39;s painfully obvious to anyone who sees this story that anything confidential they tell Stephen Miller might get leaked if it makes Miller look good. It&#39;s like a perversion of your Miranda rights, a Miranda <em>wrongs</em> if you will: Anything you say to anyone in the Trump administration can and will be used against you in leaks to the media.</p><p> You don&#39;t see stories like this about Cook or Nadella or Bezos, because I think those guys have the good sense to keep their mouths shut and just nod their heads. (Not Musk, though. When Trump and Musk eventually divorce in a spectacular flame-out, we&#39;ll be deluged with stories about what Musk said in supposed confidence.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Ship That Leaks From the Top Is Back’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Legal Nerdery on Trump&#39;s TikTok Executive Order </title><link href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump's-tiktok-executive-order-and-the-limits-of-executive-non-enforcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/legal-nerdery-on-trumps-tiktok-executive-order" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41505</id><published> 2025-01-22T20:37:49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-22T20:37:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alan Rozenshtein, writing for Lawfare:</p><blockquote><p> While Apple and Google maintained their compliance, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online">Oracle and Akamai made the remarkable decision to resume services</a> , despite facing potentially catastrophic liability rates. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump followed through by <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-orders-75-day-pause-on-tiktok-law-enforcement">issuing an executive order</a> that suspended PAFACAA enforcement for 75 days and attempted to provide retroactive protection for any violations before and during the nonenforcement period.</p><p> TikTok&#39;s tech partners face a key executive power question: Can they rely on Trump&#39;s promises not to enforce PAFACAA? If companies continue providing services to TikTok, can Trump later change his mind and pursue enforcement actions against them for all accumulated violations? Could a future administration enforce these violations regardless of Trump&#39;s current promises? The stakes are enormous — nearly a trillion dollars in potential liability.

<p>From Apple&#39;s developer release notes for iOS 18.3, now at release candidate (RC) status:</p><blockquote><p> For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes">Same for MacOS 15.3</a> Sequoia, which is also at RC status and expected next week.</p><p> I have mixed feelings about this decision. It&#39;s pretty obvious that Apple Intelligence has a slew of shortcomings. It&#39;s the nature of the beast, though, that it&#39;s always going to have some shortcomings. <em>Human</em> intelligence, which to date remains the gold standard for intelligence in general, has some pretty glaring shortcomings, so it&#39;s unsurprising that all artificial intelligence systems still do too. (Perhaps that&#39;s a good metric for defining the next inflection point, now that the Turing Test has been passed: When humans need to ask AI systems to explain their own shortcomings, because we&#39;re no longer smart enough to detect them ourselves.)</p><p> So the bar shouldn&#39;t be “has obvious shortcomings”. It&#39;s whether Apple Intelligence is good enough. Compared to other systems, like ChatGPT, no, it&#39;s not good enough. But Apple has been enabling Siri by default since 2011. And Siri, today, is arguably worse than it&#39;s ever been when compared to the state of the art. A friend just sent me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/siri-or-your-own-lii-ing-eyes.jpeg">this screenshot</a> after asking Siri “Who won Super Bowl 13?” and getting this answer: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. In addition to wrongly casing the Roman numerals, LII is 52, not 13. The only way Siri could have been more wrong would be if the Eagles hadn&#39;t even won Super Bowl 52. I just tried the same question — “Who won Super Bowl 13?” — on both my iPhone running iOS 18.3 RC1 and my Mac running MacOS 15.1.1, and Siri gave me the same wrong answer, on both devices, both when the question was spoken aloud and when it was typed: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. Siri, today, is an unfunny joke.</p><p> But so I think it&#39;s reasonable to ask whether Apple Intelligence is as good as Siri. I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s about how good Apple Intelligence is. In fact, I&#39;d say several of the Apple Intelligence features — Clean Up in Photos, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">notification summaries</a> — are <em>better</em> than Siri. So if Siri has been on by default for over a decade, sure, Apple should go ahead and turn Apple Intelligence on by default too.</p><p> I think there could be significant benefit to turning it on by default, sort of in the spirit of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">dogfooding</a> . Enabling Apple Intelligence features by default will increase the pressure on Apple to keep improving it at a fast clip. It&#39;s also the case that none of Apple Intelligence&#39;s features, with the possible exception of notification summaries, are in the user&#39;s face at all. You have to invoke them to use them. If you don&#39;t want them — or don&#39;t even know about them — you won&#39;t notice anything different once they&#39;re enabled by default. Apple may or may not be <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171226-00/?p=97655">over-indexing</a> on Apple Intelligence, but, thankfully, they&#39;re <em>not</em> shoving it in users&#39; faces.</p><p> But, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">as I wrote two weeks ago</a> , enabling it by default for all users really puts the lie to their claim that all of Apple Intelligence is “beta”. If it&#39;s not just merely shipping to all users, but now enabled by default, that&#39;s not beta. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/beta-is-not-an-excuse-archive">That&#39;s just buggy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Next Week’s iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Updates Will Enable Apple Intelligence During Onboarding’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-macos-153-apple-intelligence-default-onboarding">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Support: &#39;About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Apple Support document, which is linked from the App Store if you search for any of the apps from ByteDance:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025. [...]</p><p> If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will remain on your device. But they can&#39;t be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.</p><p> Users in the United States won&#39;t receive updates for these apps, which could potentially impact performance, security, and compatibility with future versions of iOS and iPadOS, and some app functions might become limited or stop working since the app can&#39;t receive updates 。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">My take from Sunday</a> on Trump&#39;s reprieve-by-executive-fiat seems correct: it has no bearing on the law. Really, all his executive order does is instruct the Justice Department (or as he would call it, <em>his</em> Justice Department) not to enforce the law for 75 days, and to promise any company that violates the PAFACA law that they won&#39;t be prosecuted为此。 There&#39;s really no question about it: Oracle and Akamai are violating the law by providing services to TikTok users in the United States. They&#39;re simply taking Trump at his word that the law will not be enforced and they will not face penalties for violating it during Trump&#39;s completely arbitrary 75-day grace period.</p><p> That&#39;s not like a pardon. Trump&#39;s executive order yesterday carries no more legal weight than a Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” card. I don&#39;t think it will happen but there&#39;s nothing that would stop the Trump Justice Department from changing its mind and prosecuting Oracle and Akamai for these violations. It&#39;s up to Trump. There&#39;s also nothing that would stop a future Justice Department under a post-Trump administration from holding them accountable for this.</p><p> Apple and Google are both sticking with the actual law.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Support: ‘About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Wesley Hilliard, writing for AppleInsider regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">Edits</a> , Meta&#39;s pre-announced mobile-first video editing app:</p><blockquote><p> Despite that, many apps and features on iPhone toe the line between fun tool and social platform. One of those tools was Clips, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/06/apple-launches-new-social-focused-clips-video-editing-app-for-iphone-ipad">arrived in 2017</a> to little fanfare and has been forgotten since.</p><p> Meta and ByteDance have a reason to push their respective video editing apps — brand synergy. More users mean more data, more content, and more ad revenue. Apple, however, doesn&#39;t have the same motivation.</p><p> While Apple would likely love to see users flock to Clips, it would mean entering a race to satisfy a wave of several million customers in an app and interface that was never really more than a proof of concept. It would be a money pit with very little reward as Apple doesn&#39;t have a social platform to drive users to or a way to monetize the app.</p></blockquote><p> I completely agree with Hilliard that the announcement of Edits is the perfect time to mention Clips. I completely disagree with him that Apple has no motivation to dedicate itself to the task of making Clips incredible.</p><p> A mobile-first video editor isn&#39;t a “money pit”. It&#39;s an app. Apple makes a lot of apps, and they could easily afford to assign a team to make Clips truly great. It&#39;s no different than 20–25 years ago, when Apple dedicated itself to making iMovie and Final Cut both great apps. It&#39;s no different than the motivation to create GarageBand. The monetization wouldn&#39;t be direct; it would be downstream of the general idea that if you&#39;re editing videos for social media on your phone, the best app to do it with is from Apple and it&#39;s exclusively available on iPhone. The idea is that Apple doesn&#39;t just make the best computing devices for artists, writers, and creators, but they also make some of the best apps for those fields too.</p><p> There are actually a lot of interesting UI ideas in Clips. But if Apple isn&#39;t interested in making Clips truly great for people who actually love editing videos using their phones, they should just abandon it. Make it great or give up. Keeping it around as an also-ran that no one uses is a bad look. This is the sort of thing Apple should pride itself on: best-of-breed creative tools.</p><p> I don&#39;t know if Edits is a rip-off of CapCut or not, but it&#39;s definitely not a rip-off of Clips. It&#39;s a good rule of thumb that when Apple succeeds at something, it gets ripped off. The better the Apple product, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/22/byford-china-android-forks">the more shamelessly it gets copied</a> . Apple should make Clips into an iOS video editing app that everyone rips off shamelessly.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Remember Clips?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Teases &#39;Edits&#39;, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347358/instagram-edits-capcut-video-app-tiktok-ban" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41499</id><published> 2025-01-21T00:34:09Z</published><updated> 2025-01-21T00:34:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wes Davis, writing at The Verge, under the headline “Instagram Announces a Blatant CapCut Clone”:</p><blockquote><p> Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBIzLAynIQ/">just announced</a> a video editing app called Edits. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFBNqdGSee4?xmt=AQGzCOMan-oc70fxP0uSA3x3sZd58_GJeUpjK1AD4X30tA">Mosseri said</a> the app is meant to rival CapCut, a video editing app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">went offline along with TikTok</a> . Edits is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378">preorder on the iOS App Store</a> .</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t use CapCut (and can&#39;t download it now), so I can&#39;t judge whether the screenshots of Edits indicate that it&#39;s a copycat of CapCut (say that five times fast), which would be pretty funny coming so closely on the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/">Zuckerberg&#39;s claim on Joe Rogan&#39;s show</a> that Apple hasn&#39;t invented anything new since the iPhone, or if it&#39;s just a different take on a video editing app for phones. Adobe InDesign was absolutely designed to make QuarkXPress users feel at home, but it wasn&#39;t a rip-off or clone. It was (and remains) an Adobe take on Quark-style page layout. I&#39;m curious what those familiar with CapCut think.</p><p> Glad to see The Verge warming up to calling blatant clones “blatant clones”, though, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-ripoff">rather than</a> “not exactly hiding where it got its inspiration from” and “that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing!”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Meta Teases ‘Edits’, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Dedicates Homepage to the Leader the US Is Celebrating Today </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41496</id><published> 2025-01-20T16:45:00Z</published><updated> 2025-01-20T19:18:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Interesting selection of Martin Luther King Jr. quotes they&#39;ve chosen for the homepage ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/apple.com-mlk-2025.pdf">PDF archive for posterity</a> ):</p><blockquote><ul><li> “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.”</li><li> “You must decide to speak for yourself; nobody else can speak for you.”</li><li> “We cannot preserve self without being concerned about preserving other selves.”</li></ul></blockquote><p> Read into those quotes what you will, given today&#39;s other national significance. I think there&#39;s an implied message here, but it&#39;s subtle. I&#39;ll pick a different quote from King, one that I believe better speaks to the current moment:</p><p> “The great majority of Americans are suspended between these opposing attitudes. They are uneasy with injustice but unwilling yet to pay a significant price to eradicate it.”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Dedicates Homepage to the Leader the U.S. Is Celebrating Today’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
