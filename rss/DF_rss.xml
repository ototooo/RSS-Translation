<p>这是我今天早上从苹果发言人杰奎琳·罗伊（Jacqueline Roy）逐字了解的声明：</p><blockquote><p> “ Siri帮助我们的用户找到了他们的需求并快速完成工作，在过去的六个月中，我们使Siri更加对话，引入了新功能，例如Type of Siri和产品知识，并与Chatgpt添加了集成。我们还一直在研究一个更个性化的Siri，使其对您的个人背景有了更多的了解，以及在您的应用程序内部和跨应用程序中采取行动的能力。这将花费我们的时间比我们想象的要花费的时间更长，并且我们预计在来年将它们推出。”</p></blockquote><p>这是一个星期五的<em>Wah-Waaah</em>悲伤的脚步新闻，但苹果公司登上它并准确设定期望是很好的。</p><p>读这条线之间的读物以及根据我在库比蒂诺 - 埃斯（Cupertino-Ese）中的博士学位流利<em>度</em>，苹果在这里所说的是，这些“更个性化的Siri”功能从今年的OS周期到明年：iOS 19和MacOS 16。这些年有效地从WWDC开始。从苹果的角度来看，问题是他们没有谈论未来的产品。他们尚未正式承认将要有iOS 19或MacOS 16。他们甚至还没有宣布将有一个WWDC 2025。但是他们确实希望准确地设定期望，尤其是对于苹果自己的营销推动力的高知名度（例如Apple Intellionce）。所以我们在这里。</p><p>这些功能在iOS 18.4/macOS 15.4中并没有出现，因为它们不在开发人员的Beta中。如果这些功能在iOS 18.5/macOS 15.5甚至iOS 18.6/macOS 15.6中出现，那么苹果就不会觉得有必要发表“这需要我们比我们想象的更长的……”声明。在iOS 18.5甚至18.6中提供“更个性化的Siri”本来会按照最初宣布的时间表进行交付，这是从WWDC 2024开始的“即将到来的一年”。那将是那个“年”的尾声，但在其中。但是，苹果仅限于自我强加的库比蒂诺 - 埃斯（Cupertino-Ese）的不透明词，但不会阐明这一点。但是请相信我，您可以依靠它：他们今天宣布的是，这些功能在iOS 19/MacOS 16中出现。</p><p> Siri在今年的OS周期（iOS/iPados 18 + MacOS 15红杉）中的苹果智能伞下的几种有用但迭代的方法<em>有所</em>改善，但是去年6月在WWDC上展出的大型“个性化的Siri”是Siri相关的Apple Intelligence，这些东西是人们，人们对此很兴奋，最令人兴奋。这是“ <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/integrating-actions-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence">应用程序意图</a>”的内容 - 需要Siri可以访问并有效地<em>了解您的个人信息的功能</em>，并在您的应用程序中私下存储在您的设备上。这些是Apple Intelligence最有用的，最实用的，最实用的，最未来派的特征。而且它们是Apple几乎独特地提供的功能，仅与Google一起作为移动平台和设备生态系统的提供商。</p><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">根据苹果自己的公告</a>，在WWDC主题演讲之后：</p><blockquote><p> Siri将能够提供针对用户及其设备信息量身定制的情报。例如，用户可以说：“播放杰米推荐的那个播客”，而Siri将找到和播放该集，而无需记住该播放，而不必记住它是在文本还是电子邮件中提到的。或者他们可以问：“妈妈的飞行何时登陆？” Siri将找到飞行的详细信息，并通过实时飞行跟踪交叉引用，以提供到达时间。</p></blockquote><p> “妈妈什么时候登陆？”我们的人类很容易理解，这是一个很好的例子，说明了那种显然有用的Siri互动。但是您也可以轻松地看到它在苹果方面的复杂程度。 Siri长期以来能够做“妈妈”的事情。您的配偶，您的孩子 - 您早已能够告诉Siri以这样的昵称给这些人打电话或发短信。但是，从您的电子邮件中获取妈妈的飞行信息（我认为这是WWDC主题演示中此演示的前提 - 飞行信息被存储在邮件中或短信中，然后知道如何检查<em>该</em>航班的当前飞行状态信息，这远远超出了当前Siri的Ken。获取信息需要访问您的最个人信息 - 您自己的电子邮件和消息。从您的消息中获取<em>正确的</em>信息需要一种常见的理解，即您显然在询问妈妈正在询问的某种<em>目前的</em>旅行，而不是她向您发送了一封电子邮件，她向您发送了有关2019年的航班，即2022年，甚至是去年12月的一台飞行。我们目前知道的Siri<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">缺乏这种常识</a>。最后，在从电子邮件中获取正确的航班后，执行此任务要求Siri让该机构可以查找该特定航班的当前状态，并<em>在每次提供答案时</em>正确地将其正确处理。</p><p>如果Siri回答说：“您妈妈的航班今天下午4:30到达，目前正在显示准时到达，”您确实希望该信息正确，如果您答应将她接送在机场。如果您开车去机场，您会很生气，事实证明她直到7:30才真正着陆。如果她在1:30登陆，三个小时后，您会<em>遇到</em>麻烦，您会出现，因为Siri的答案准确。</p><hr /><p>至少可以说，苹果宣布产品延迟是非常不寻常的。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-07">1</a></sup>白色iPhone 4本来应该在2010年6月与黑色iPhone一起首次亮相，但奇怪的是被推迟了几次（我<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-writer-john-gruber-that-white-iphone-i-tweeted-about-was-a-toy-2010-11">不止一次</a><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/10/anthropomorphized_white_iphone_4">玩乐</a>），<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/04/27/jobs-schiller">直到明年4月底</a>，迟到了10个月。最初的AirPods于2016年9月与iPhone 7一起宣布，原定于10月发货。他们最终被推迟到12月。苹果在2016年10月的声明中，关于AirPods被延迟， <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/apple-delays-airpod-rollout-dont-expect-them-in-october/">如TechCrunch的Matthew Panzarino</a> ：</p><blockquote><p> “对Airpods的早期反应令人难以置信。我们不相信在产品准备就绪之前运送产品，并且在AirPods为客户准备好之前，我们需要更多的时间。”</p></blockquote><p>这就是为什么Apple掌握了几乎宗教政策，即在准备好之前没有宣布产品。当他们<em>确实</em>做出例外时（如上所述，如上所述（<a href="#fn1-2025-03-07">如下</a>），他们经常后悔。您不能打破从未做出的承诺，也不能错过您从未宣布的船约会。即使有才华横溢的团队和现实的经理，您期望一个项目需要花费多长时间和实际需要多长时间之间的范围也很长。即使使用可预测的技术，工程时间表也经常滑倒，而LLMS的非确定性使他们的未来本质上是不可预测的。</p><p>苹果情报的大部分感觉就像苹果公司已经将其推迟了一年，比公司通常的烘焙水平提前了一年。我全年都认为，如果整个行业与华尔街一起 - 没有进入生成型/LLM躁狂症，那么直到今年的WWDC而不是去年才宣布“苹果情报”。今天的宣布令人失望，但对我来说毫不奇怪。通过应用程序意图与个人数据的Siri集成从未感觉像在今年的OS周期中为真实客户使用做好准备的事情。而且，如果苹果公司的一般政策在准备好之前不运送产品，则适用于涉及LLM访问深度私人式智障信息的产品十倍。要迟到，但准备就绪，比运送一些未完成或不可靠的东西要命中应许的截止日期。凭借下一代Siri之类的东西，我想说这是至关重要的。苹果可以将今天的宣布不良宣布正在引起。他们负担不起浪费用户的信任。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-07"><p>当然，现代时代的苹果产品延迟的祖父是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/airpower">Airpower-</a> Apple在2017年9月与iPhone X和iPhone 8一起预言的多设备（iPhone，Apple Watch，AirPods）充电设备。它最终从未发货，但<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/03/29/airpower-canceled">直到2019年3月29日</a>，该插头才正式拉动（可以这么说），这是在宣布18个月后荒谬的。 <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★苹果正在延迟“更个性化的Siri” Apple Intelligence功能</title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/abc_shuts_down_fivethirtyeight" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w50" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：//1.41652</id><published> 2025-03-06T17：12：37Z</published><updated> 2025-03-07T01：06：25Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">从迪士尼大小的公司的角度来看，永远将FiveThirtyEight的网站永远留在周围。多么耻辱。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>奥利弗·达西（Oliver Darcy），报告（paywalled，las），<a href="https://www.status.news/p/abc-news-layoffs">关于fivethirtyeight的突然消亡</a>：</p><blockquote><p>网络总裁Almin Karamehmedovic在周三早上，在宣布裁员的全力备忘录宣布裁员后不久，加入了与FiveThirtyeight团队的虚拟会议。 ABC新闻拥有的政治分析网站上的15名员工通过华尔街日报的报告了解到了前一天晚上，他们被放开了。现在，他们亲自从卡拉梅迈托维奇那里听到了这句话。</p><p>但是，像其他经理在当天在ABC新闻上进行大规模裁员的其他经理人一样，对此几乎没有话要说。有人告诉我，当他传达毁灭性消息时，他似乎正在从剧本中读书。他没有提供有关为什么迪士尼拥有的网络决定关闭FiveThirtyeight的原因，该网络与Data Whiz和当时的编辑Nate Silver一起收购。他没有提出任何疑问。他只是感谢员工的工作，告诉他们人力资源员工将跟进，并结束了会议。有人告诉我，整个事件持续了大约15分钟。不久之后，员工可以访问ABC新闻的系统关闭，而FiveThirtyeight网站也被<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538">脱机</a>。就这样，它结束了。</p></blockquote><p>业务是业务，裁员和关闭绝不是创伤。但是，有一种正确的方法可以做事和错误的方法。错误的方法之一是让工作人员发现自己都通过<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-to-cut-nearly-6-staff-across-abc-news-disney-entertainment-networks-8af04b40">阅读《华尔街日报》而</a>被解雇。这个家伙Karamehmedovic听起来像是一个真正的A级笨蛋。</p><p>与这些公司关闭网站时毫不客气地插入插件的公司怎么办？为什么不将FiveThirtyEight网站启动和运行 - 至少一段时间（即使不永久）？为静态/存档网站运行服务器几乎没有花费。我不明白。它背叛了对该网站主持的作品的深刻不尊重。如果他们想关闭FiveThirtyeight作为一个持续的关注，这是ABC的业务，但是多年的工作值得保持在线，这都是出于对那些成立次数的人的尊重<em>以及</em>可能仍然想提及它的观众的尊重。迪士尼没有像<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchstone_Pictures">Touchstone Pictures</a>这样关闭的子公司工作室燃烧电影。</p><p>旧的印刷世界与在线出版的新世界之间存在着巨大的鸿沟。这种区别是深刻的，但在很大程度上被忽略了，因为仅适应不同形式的媒体的本质并迅速接受当前的媒体形式是“正常”是人的本性。通过印刷，对观众来说，问题在很大程度上是短暂的。您每天都会收到一份报纸，每周或一个月都会杂志，并且在阅读它们后会扔掉它们。如果您想回顾一下该报纸每年，一个月甚至几天前都发表了关于某些内容的内容，那么您就不幸了，就可以当场查找。图书馆员从事Yeoman的工作，将报纸和杂志归为缩微胶卷，所以什么都没有消失或遗忘，但是访问缩微胶卷档案是一种巨大的麻烦。您几乎必须知道您想看到的问题的日期，并且必须用页面上的眼球进行“搜索”。今天，任何人都可以立即访问一周，一个月，年甚至数十年的故事的能力是网络出版物的令人叹为观止的优势。在过去的15年左右的时间里，我们有能力从我们所有人的口袋里都携带的小机器来做到这一点。这是真的很棒。</p><p>但是关闭Web出版物时的标准行为就是仅拉插头。当整个公司陷入困境时，那是一回事。但是，当有一家母公司，尤其是一家蓬勃发展的公司时，除了无视这项工作之外，没有其他理由来拉插头。从迪士尼大小的公司的角度来看，永远将FiveThirtyEight的网站永远留在周围。多么耻辱。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ABC关闭FiveThirtyEight，并在其网站上拉插头</title></entry><entry><title>Nate Silver在Fivethirtyeight的消亡中</title><link href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w51" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/06/silver-fivethirtyeight" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41653</id><published> 2025-03-06T16：14：26z</published><updated> 2025-03-06T18：22：23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Both M4 MacBook Air models are priced $100 less than their predecessors: $1199 for the 15-inch model and $999 for the 13-incher. If I&#39;m not mistaken, this is the first time that the new-generation design of MacBook Air introduced with the M2 chip has been available at the classic $999 price at launch. (The M1 Air, based on the Intel-era visual design, debuted at $999, but the M2 Air debuted at $1199 and only reached $999 when it was offered as an older model alongside the M3 Air.) As of now, the M4 Air can hold down the sub-$1000 price point all on its own, and previous models are mostly discontinued.</p><p> Another surprise is the the new color option: Space Gray is out. The ultra-dark-blue Midnight remains, as do the classic Silver and hint-of-champagne Starlight. The new color is Sky Blue, which apparently is a metallic light blue that really shows itself as a color gradient when viewed at various angles.</p></blockquote><p> Very cool that the new M4 starts at $999. Each successive generation of Apple Silicon, at least in laptops, is getting more and more predictably regular.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces, With Little Surprise, M4 MacBook Airs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/apple-announces-with-little-surprise-m4-macbook-airs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>谁在乎获得新闻时，当您以$ 32,000/年彭博终端订阅的价格快速获得新闻？ </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41649</id><published> 2025-03-06T01:30:45Z</published><updated> 2025-03-06T01:47:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg on 6 December 2024, regarding Apple&#39;s first in-house cellular modem, “ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027">Apple Plans Three-Year Modem Rollout in Bid to Top Qualcomm</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> For now, the modem won&#39;t be used in Apple&#39;s higher-end products. It&#39;s set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23, that features a far-thinner design than current models. The chip will also start rolling out as early as 2025 in Apple&#39;s lower-end iPads.</p></blockquote><p> We now know the name of that modem, the C1, from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">its debut in the iPhone 16e last month</a> . Then, also on December 6, in a separate report headlined “ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets">Apple Explores Macs, Headsets With Built-In Cellular Data</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> The first modem will also appear in low-end iPads next year, with the 2026 update coming to Pro versions of the iPhone and iPad.</p></blockquote><p> The cellular models of the new 11th generation iPads announced yesterday do not, it turns out, use the C1. The specs don&#39;t match those of the iPhone 16e, and when I asked an Apple representative, they confirmed that none of the new iPads (including the Airs) use the C1 modem. (But, Apple reassured me, they all offer terrific cellular networking.)</p><p> I&#39;m not saying Gurman was wrong, because there are nine full months left in 2025 for Apple to release a 12th-generation low-end iPad with the C1. The previous (10th) generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-unveils-completely-redesigned-ipad-in-four-vibrant-colors/">came out in October 2022</a> , but the 9th generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apples-most-popular-ipad-delivers-even-more-performance-and-advanced-features/">came in September 2021</a> , just 13 months prior. And this week&#39;s new M3 iPad Airs replaced M2 models that <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">arrived just 10 months ago</a> . But, you know, it sure seems doubtful Apple is going to rev this hardware in 2025, so I&#39;ll place my bet that he was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads">wrong about this too</a> .</p><p> (And yes, a Bloomberg Terminal subscription really does <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bloomberg_terminal.asp">start at $32,000/year per seat</a> .)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Who Cares About Getting News That’s True When You’re Getting It Fast With a $32,000/Year Bloomberg Terminal Subscription?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>新常规iPad上的ACE记者Mark Gurman </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41648</id><published> 2025-03-06T00:16:07Z</published><updated> 2025-03-06T00:21:38Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, in his Power On column for Bloomberg, on January 12:</p><blockquote><p> The new entry-level iPads — J481 and J482 — will get faster processors and Apple Intelligence. The current models have the A14 chip and 4 gigabytes of memory. Look for the new versions to have the A17 Pro chip, matching the iPad mini, and a bump to 8 gigabytes of memory. That&#39;s the minimum needed to support the new AI platform.</p></blockquote><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates">new iPads</a> sport the A16 chip and thus do not support Apple Intelligence. But who cares about little details like that when you know the codenames, which is what really matters.</p><p> I&#39;ll bet what happened is that Gurman was right, and the new iPads were set to use the A17 Pro chip and support Apple Intelligence. But after Gurman spoiled it seven weeks ago, Apple scrapped those plans and changed the chips to the A16 just to spite him.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Mark Gurman, Ace Reporter, on the New Regular iPads’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Tapbots Releases Ivory 2.3 — and Announces That Phoenix, a Bluesky Client, Is Coming </title><link href="https://tapbots.social/@ivory/114110436182458268" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4v" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/tapbots-ivory-phoenix" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41647</id><published> 2025-03-05T23:26:11Z</published><updated> 2025-03-06T00:41:05Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, yesterday at noon ET:</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s not an “Air” — but the new Mac Studio, codenamed J575, appears to be imminent. It could be announced as early as this week along with the new MacBook Airs. There are signs these will come with an M4 Max but that its new Ultra chip will actually be an M3 Ultra.</p></blockquote><p> Quite the scoop breaking this news after Apple started briefing media about it under NDA yesterday.</p><p> He&#39;s not fooling anyone by dropping the J575 codename (which Apple would never include in a media briefing). That&#39;s a bit of ham-fisted misdirection to make it seem like his source for this came from a product-aware source inside Apple, when in fact he almost certainly got it from someone in the media yesterday. (Codenames in and of themselves aren&#39;t much of a secret inside Apple. That&#39;s one reason they keep them so boring: <em>letter-digit-digit-digit</em> , usually.)</p><p> Apple conducted virtual media briefings yesterday for the iPad (M3 iPad Airs and A16 regular iPads) and Mac (M4 MacBook Airs and M4 Max/M3 Ultra Mac Studios). Apple announced the new iPads on Apple Newsroom yesterday morning at 9:00am ET, <em>before</em> those media briefings took place — the briefings were a recap of the announced news. Apple announced the new Macs today at 9:00am ET, <em>after</em> yesterday&#39;s media briefings, which were under embargo until this morning. If you think it&#39;s a coincidence that Gurman dropped zero last-minute tidbits about the new iPads (which were not briefed to the press ahead of time), but did drop the surprise M3 Ultra Mac Studio news (which was briefed, under embargo, ahead of time), I have a bridge to sell you.</p><p> He did the same thing with the VisionOS 2.4 news (Apple Intelligence, the new Spatial Gallery app, guest mode improvements). Apple held media briefings to share this news on Friday 14 February, under the condition that it was embargoed until the VisionOS 2.4 beta <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-intelligence-comes-to-apple-vision-pro-in-april/">dropped the next week</a> . But Gurman ran a report at Bloomberg with the embargoed info <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/apple-vision-pro-visionos-2-4-adds-apple-intelligence-spatial-content">on Saturday 15 February</a> . The only stuff he&#39;s right about lately is what he gets from someone (or someones?) in the media leaking him embargoed info. It&#39;s not going to take Sherlock Holmes for Apple to figure this out, especially when most of the Mac briefings yesterday were later in the day, after Gurman&#39;s tweets. I&#39;d put even money on him burning his source yesterday.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Your Source for Scoops Half a Day Before They’re Announced Publicly’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/your-source-for-scoops">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>特朗普2.0比kakistocracy更愚蠢</title><link href="https://bsky.app/profile/ronfilipkowski.bsky.social/post/3ljj4sijyrk24" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/trump-2-idiocracy-chickens" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41645</id><published> 2025-03-05T01:46:47Z</published><updated> 2025-03-05T03:10:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ron Filipkowski:</p><blockquote><p> Trump&#39;s Sec of Agriculture Brooke Rollins says the solution to high egg prices for Americans is to get some chickens and raise them in your backyard.</p></blockquote><p>没有夸张。 She&#39;s selling the idea of everyone raising chickens in their back yards as “awesome”, with a laugh and a smile. And then the Fox News host (Rachel Campos-Duffy — wife of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy — this whole world is comprised of socially-inbred reality-TV has-beens), smiling and laughing, concludes with “I think everyone who isn&#39;t a farmer right now wants to be, so you&#39;re in the right department, Brooke!”</p><p> This is a cult. No sense of “ <em>Hey, maybe this egg situation wasn&#39;t so simple.

No, instead, they&#39;ve decided the answer is that all good-thinking Americans now happily want to be chicken farmers.</p><p> Next month: the fun of home dentistry.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Trump 2.0 Is More Idiocracy Than Kakistocracy’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/trump-2-idiocracy-chickens">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Taska现在是LeitMotif（万花筒的开发人员）的一部分</title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/04/makers-of-kaleidoscope-just-acquired-another-native-mac-app-for-developers-and-everything-is-50-off/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/taska-leitmotif" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41644</id><published> 2025-03-05T00:36:51Z</published><updated> 2025-03-05T00:36:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Zac Hall, writing at 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> Leitmotif, the team behind the awesome diff and merge Mac app Kaleidoscope, is expanding its portfolio of native Mac apps for developers. The company has acquired Taska, a native Mac app that serves as a frontend for web services like GitHub and GitLab. [...] To celebrate its release of Taska 1.3, Leitmotif is <a href="https://leitmotif.dev/promotion">discounting its apps by 50%</a> for a limited time.</p></blockquote><p> When Taska debuted last year, its original developers (Made by Windmill) sponsored DF for the week to promote it (the app was briefly named Sonar, before some sort of legal contretemps prompted a change), and thanking them, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/25/sonar">I wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Taska combines the lightweight UI of a to-do app with the power of enterprise-level issue tracking, all in a native app built by long-time Mac nerds. The interface is deceptively simple, and very intuitive. Fast and fluid too. Everything that&#39;s great about native Mac apps is exemplified by Taska. If you&#39;ve ever thought, “Man, if only Apple made a native GitHub client...”, you should run, not walk, to download it.</p><p> Taska saves all your changes directly to GitHub/GitLab using their official APIs, so your data remains secure on GitHub&#39;s servers — not Taska&#39;s. Do you have team members not using Taska?没问题。 Changes you make in Taska are 100% compatible with the web UI.</p></blockquote><p> Leitmotif&#39;s Kaleidoscope is a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/17/kaleidoscope-20">longtime</a> stalwart in any Mac nerd&#39;s toolbox. I can&#39;t think of a better sibling to an app like Taska.

Joseph Tartaro got a license plate with the word “NULL” on it nearly 10 years ago. The 36-year-old security auditor thought it would be funny to drive around with the symbol for an empty value. Maybe a police officer who tried to give him a ticket would end up writing null into the system and not be able to process it, he joked to himself.</p><p> In 2018 he paid a $35 parking ticket. Soon afterward, he said, his mailbox was flooded with hundreds of traffic tickets for incidents he hadn&#39;t been involved in. Tickets were from other counties and cities for vehicles of different colors, makes and models. A database had associated the word “null” with his personal information and citations were sent to Tartaro, who lives in Los Angeles.</p></blockquote><p> Brings to mind the classic “ <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">Little Bobby Tables</a> ” from XKCD.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘When Your Last Name Is Null, Nothing Works’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/null">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Money Job&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/opinion/ben-stiller-gene-hackman.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1k4.SQm-.jbz9WEyoATEH&amp;smid=url-share" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4q" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/money-job" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41642</id><published> 2025-03-05T00:04:09Z</published><updated> 2025-03-05T00:04:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ben Stiller, in a delightful piece for The New York Times on working up the gumption to tell Gene Hackman — with whom he was working in Wes Anderson&#39;s excellent <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> , his favorite Hackman movie:</p><blockquote><p> “ … but I have to say for me, there is one movie you made that means so much to me. It might sound crazy, but I think it&#39;s the reason I wanted to make movies. It&#39;s &#39;The Poseidon Adventure.&#39; It literally was my favorite movie when it came out. I think I was 7 or something and I went to see it in the theater about 10 times, then watched it repeatedly whenever it was on TV. It was so formative, and you were so good in it, and it just for me was my favorite movie for so long because of the excitement of that incredible score and those actors and the action and just all of it. It really changed my life and just … made me want to make movies.”</p><p> He smiled a little. He looked forward, thinking, perhaps about the movie, as if it hadn&#39;t crossed his mind for a long time. Then he grinned and said:</p><p> “Money job.”</p></blockquote><p> I can hear those words in Hackman&#39;s voice.

<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> The most consequential part of the Air&#39;s update — perhaps the <em>only</em> real update — is the M3 processor, which brings with it GPU-based capabilities like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and video encoding and decoding for ProRes and ProRes RAW.</p><p> Otherwise, the Air is basically unchanged: it comes in 11-inch and 13-inch versions, features the same cameras, battery life, the exact same dimensions, and the same accessory compatibility as its M2-based predecessor. It even comes in the same colors — Space Gray, Blue, Purple, and Starlight — at the same prices starting at $599.</p></blockquote><p> A true speed-bump update — no big whoop, but it&#39;s good for the platform for devices to get regular speed-bump updates in between major new revisions. The previous M2 iPad Air models only came out in May of last year, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/05/brief_thoughts_and_observations_on_yesterdays_let_loose_ipad_keynote">alongside the M4 iPad Pro models</a> . <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/ipad-air-m2-9-core-gpu">Just like those M2 iPad Air models</a> , these new M3 iPad Airs have 9-core GPUs.

I presume these 9-core M3 chips used for the iPad Air are <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/glossary-binning-definition,5892.html">binned chips</a> that didn&#39;t have 10 good GPU cores?</p><blockquote><p> The new Magic Keyboard for Air is interesting in that it seems to meld parts of the older Magic Keyboard with the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/some-hands-on-ipad-event-impressions/">last May</a> . While the new Magic Keyboard includes a function row and a larger trackpad like its Pro compatriot, it lacks haptics in the trackpad and backlit keys, and it seems to be built on the same design of the original silicone exterior instead of the new aluminum-based model. But you get some cost savings for that: it&#39;s just $269 instead of $299. Also, it only comes in white — black keyboards are for pros, I guess.</p></blockquote><p> $269 feels like a crummy deal. The new-from-last-year $299 Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, with an aluminum top, feels way more than $30 better than the old-style silicone-covered ones like this new Magic Keyboard for iPad Air. It kind of feels like a design failure of some sort that these new iPad Airs can&#39;t use the same Magic Keyboards as the iPad Pros of the same size.</p><blockquote><p> The base iPad&#39;s update is perhaps somewhat more disappointing, as that model was introduced in 2022 and its A16 processor will make it one of the few current main-line Apple devices — perhaps only — not to support Apple Intelligence.</p></blockquote><p> The recently updated iPad Mini ( <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-powerful-new-ipad-mini-built-for-apple-intelligence/">October</a> ) has an A17 Pro chip, and thus supports Apple Intelligence. But the iPad Mini starts at $500, and the regular iPad still starts at just $350. The just-plain iPad is really the only “budget” device that Apple makes. There are no iPhone or Mac models in that price range.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Updates iPad Air (M2→M3) and Regular iPad (A14→A16), and Revamps Magic Keyboard for iPad Air’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Hasn&#39;t Updated Its US Government Transparency Report Since June 2023, 20 Months Ago </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/apple-us-government-transparency-report-20-months" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41640</id><published> 2025-03-04T19:13:31Z</published><updated> 2025-03-04T20:30:19Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, writing for iFixit:</p><blockquote><p> But it&#39;s still missing MagSafe, for no obvious reason other than making the phone less appealing to consumers than the rest of the 16 lineup. Wireless charging without the perfect alignment that MagSafe allows is troubling.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been waiting for iFixit&#39;s teardown to see if removing MagSafe components might help explain the 16e&#39;s physically larger battery. It doesn&#39;t seem to. The 16e battery seems taller, not thicker, and the MagSafe components in an iPhone 15 don&#39;t seem thick or space consuming. But there remains a very obvious reason for its exclusion: cost. The 16e is priced $200 less than a comparable regular 16, so something has to give, and MagSafe, alas, is one of those things.</p><p> The 16e did garner a 7/10 repairability score — very high for an Apple product from iFixit. But their party line is that you still shouldn&#39;t buy one, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108337/why-a-refurbished-iphone-might-be-better-and-cheaper-than-a-brand-new-iphone-16e">opting instead for a refurbished older iPhone 14</a> . Refurb iPhones are great, and they&#39;re popular for a reason, but it feels like recommending refurb over new is dogma for iFixit at this point. When&#39;s the last time they recommended any new product? For $600 I think it&#39;s hard to beat a new iPhone 16e for current value and future-proofing.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iFixit’s iPhone 16e Teardown’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/ifixit-iphone-16e-teardown">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Free Speech Will Continue Until Trump&#39;s Morale Improves </title><link href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114104167452161158" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/trump-protests" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41638</id><published> 2025-03-04T17:21:14Z</published><updated> 2025-03-04T17:21:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Overall, though, I&#39;ll award Young a Being Right Point for this call from 2022.</p><blockquote><p> Moving to an all-screen design, there will no longer be space for a capacitive Touch ID Home button in the device&#39;s bottom bezel.

You can just drop a screenshot in and copy a framed version out with zero fuss, but there are also all sorts of tweaks and adjustments you can make, right down to choosing which shade of titanium to color your specific iPhone Pro model. Chapman has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24sAXuB_DY">a great 20-minute walkthrough video</a> showing all of Framous&#39;s features, and he posted <a href="https://mastodon.social/@charliemchapman/114065382722677009">a bunch of shorter videos</a> showcasing specific features to Mastodon.

<p>Dan Moren, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/02/apple-details-improvements-to-child-accounts-app-store-age-filtering/">writing at Six Colors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> In a whitepaper posted to Apple&#39;s developer site entitled <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Helping-Protect-Kids-Online-2025.pdf">“Helping Protect Kids Online”</a> , the company details several improvements it&#39;s rolling out in upcoming software updates, including making it easier to set up child accounts, providing age ranges to developers, and filtering content on the App Store. [...]</p><p> It&#39;s also worth noting that these announcements are happening against the backdrop of more stringent age-verification laws enacted in US states like Texas and Oklahoma. <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2025/02/25/lgbtq-abortion-censorship-age-verification-laws/">Critics of those laws</a> contend that they unfairly target LGBTQ+ communities. Apple, for its part, says that it holds to a standard of data minimization, not sharing any more information than is necessary. So, for example, offering developers access to the age range of a user — with the consent of a parent — rather than providing a birthdate.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Helping-Protect-Kids-Online-2025.pdf">From Apple&#39;s whitepaper</a> (PDF):</p><blockquote><p> At Apple, we believe in <em>data minimization</em> — collecting and using only the minimum amount of data required to deliver what you need. This is especially important for the issue of “age assurance,” which covers a variety of methods that establish a user&#39;s age with some level of confidence. Some apps may find it appropriate or even legally required to use age verification, which confirms user age with a high level of certainty — often through collecting a user&#39;s sensitive personal information (like a government- issued ID) — to keep kids away from inappropriate content. But most apps don&#39;t. That&#39;s why the right place to address the dangers of age- restricted content online is the limited set of websites and apps that host that kind of content. After all, we ask merchants who sell alcohol in a mall to verify a buyer&#39;s age by checking IDs — we don&#39;t ask everyone to turn their date of birth over to the mall if they just want to go to the food court.</p></blockquote><p> Meta has been vocally backing the various state initiatives that Moren referenced, that would require app stores to verify the exact age of children. To use Apple&#39;s apt metaphor, Meta wants the mall owner to require checking ID for everyone who enters the mall, not just those who purchase alcohol. Meta also, of course, wants itself to then have access to those exact ages verified by the app store — it wants to know the exact age of every child using its platforms, and wants the App Store and Play Store to do the dirty work of verifying those ages and providing them via APIs to developers.</p><p> There are a <em>lot</em> of parents who supervise their kids&#39; online activities and simply don&#39;t permit them to use platforms — like, oh, say, Meta&#39;s — where age restrictions are necessary for some content. So why should those parents be required to provide privacy-intrusive verification of their kids&#39; birthdates just to let the kids play and use innocent G-rated games and apps?</p><p> Meta is clearly in the wrong here, and they&#39;re using culture-war fear-mongering to try to get what they want through misdirection.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Details Upcoming Changes and Improvements to Child Accounts, App Store Age Restrictions, and More’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/apple-details-upcoming-changes-and-improvements-to-child-accounts">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>杰里米·基思（Jeremy Keith）在手机上的网络上</title><link href="https://adactio.com/journal/21728" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/keith-web-on-mobile" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41633</id><published> 2025-03-03T19:46:24Z</published><updated> 2025-03-03T21:14:16Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jeremy Keith, writing at Adactio:</p><blockquote><p> Ask anyone about their experience of using websites on their mobile device.

Specifically, the people who make websites.</p></blockquote><p> There are mobile web proponents who are in denial about this state of affairs, who seek to place the blame at Apple&#39;s feet for the fact that WebKit is the only rendering engine available on iOS. But WebKit&#39;s limitations have nothing to do with the reasons so many websites suck when experienced on mobile devices. The mobile web sucks just as bad on Android. Apple&#39;s WebKit-only rule on iOS is just a useful scapegoat for the fact that most websites, as experienced on phones, are designed and engineered to suck. It&#39;s not whatever features WebKit lacks that Chrome-myopic web developers want. It&#39;s all the crap that web developers <em>add</em> — tens of megabytes of JavaScript libraries and frameworks; pop-ups and pop-overs all over the screen; <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolljacking-101/">scrolljacking</a> and other deliberate breakage of built-in UI behavior — that makes the experience suck.

<p>John Cassidy, writing for The New Yorker (requires a free account to read, annoyingly):</p><blockquote><p> Of course, these calculations can&#39;t be taken literally. Even Musk has said that he wants to protect essential workers. If the entire federal workforce were eliminated, there&#39;d be no one to make sure that federal benefits got paid or that federal taxes were collected. The spending and revenue figures would crater; essential services like veterans&#39; hospitals, air-traffic-control systems, and border-crossing stations would be completely abandoned. But this thought experiment does illustrate the point that “bloated” payrolls aren&#39;t what is driving federal spending and deficits. Since the nineteen-seventies, as the accompanying chart shows, the total number of federal employees has remained fairly steady.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/nyer-chart-federal-employees.png">Here&#39;s a copy of the chart</a> . Cassidy continues:</p><blockquote><p> Unlike the figures from the US Office of Personnel Management, the chart, which comes from the Federal Reserve Economic Database, counts members of the US Postal Service as federal employees. It does show that the federal workforce has grown in recent years, but it&#39;s still no larger than it was thirty or forty years ago. During the interim, total employment elsewhere in the economy has grown steadily alongside population growth. Consequently, the size of the federal workforce relative to the workforce at large has fallen considerably, as the following chart shows.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/nyer-chart-federal-workforce-proportion.png">Here&#39;s a copy of that second chart</a> .</p><p> I knew the supposed justifications for the whole DOGE endeavor were a sham, but until this piece I was under the incorrect assumption that the federal government workforce has been growing steadily for decades, at least keeping pace with its percentage of the overall US workforce. The opposite is true — because the federal workforce size has remained steady while the population has continued to grow, its share of the overall workforce has in fact shrunk considerably.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Size of the US Federal Workforce Has Not Grown in the Last 50 Years’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/the-size-of-the-us-federal-workforce-has-not-grown-in-the-last-50-years">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> VisionOS 2.4, Now in Beta, Will Add New &#39;Spatial Gallery&#39; App and Support for Apple Intelligence, Along With a &#39;Vision Pro&#39; App for iPhones </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/new-visionos-beta-adds-apple-intelligence-spatial-gallery-ios-apps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/visionos-2-4-spatial-gallery-app" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41631</id><published> 2025-03-03T17:33:02Z</published><updated> 2025-03-03T22:11:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing last week at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> While a lot of us have gotten excited about the potential of Apple&#39;s immersive video format, the truth is that the Vision Pro is also a great viewer of more traditional 3-D video content. And Apple has built a new visionOS app to highlight great spatial content: Spatial Gallery.</p><p> Think of Spatial Gallery as something sort of like the TV app, but for spatial videos, photos, and panoramas. The content comes from Apple as well as third-party content sources, and Apple is curating it all itself. The company says the content will be updated on a regular basis, and among the demo content I saw featured was some of 3-D (not immersive) behind-the-scenes content from various Apple TV+ productions such as “Severance” and “Shrinking.”</p><p> Just as the Apple Watch has its own app on iOS, so too will the Vision Pro. The new Vision Pro iOS app will be available with iOS 18.4, and will automatically appear on the iPhones of people who have Vision Pros. Of course the app will show off new content and offer tips, but it&#39;s also functional: If you add highlighted media content via the app, it&#39;ll be set to download on the Vision Pro. Similarly, you can use the Vision Pro app to remotely download apps to your Vision Pro, so they&#39;re ready for you when you put the headset on.</p></blockquote><p> VisionOS 2.4 is also making some big improvements to guest mode, making it much easier to let someone else use your Vision Pro.

<p>Ming-Chi Kuo, back on Sunday September 15:</p><blockquote><p> Based on my latest supply chain survey and pre-order results from Apple&#39;s official websites, I&#39;ve compiled key data on iPhone 16&#39;s first-weekend pre-orders for each model, including pre-order sales, average delivery times, and shipments before pre-order. [...]</p><p> Analysis and Conclusions:</p><p> iPhone 16 series first-weekend pre-order sales are estimated at about 37 million units, down about 12.7% YoY from last year&#39;s iPhone 15 series first-weekend sales. The key factor is the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series.</p></blockquote><p> Note that pre-orders for the iPhone 16 lineup only started two days prior, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/get-ready-to-upgrade-to-the-new-iphone-16-apple-watch-and-airpods-lineups/">on Friday September 13</a> . Here were Kuo&#39;s estimates for first-weekend pre-order sales, compared year-over-year to the equivalent iPhone 15 models:</p><p><table class="table-96B8661B-2F34-48B3-80A8-CA76E29911A6" width = 200><style>

There was no marked downswing in demand for the 16 Pro and Pro Max, and there was no wild upswing in demand for the 16 Plus. Just one month after posting the above opening-weekend nonsense, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/iphone-16-pro-demand-estimate/">Kuo himself reported</a> , “iPhone 16 orders were cut by around 10M units for 4Q24–1H25, with most of the cuts affecting non-Pro models.” So in September Kuo claimed Pro sales were alarmingly down and regular iPhone 16 and 16 Plus sales were surprisingly strong, but in October he said Apple cut orders mostly with the “non-Pro models”. So why was any of this <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/15/lower-iphone-16-pro-demand/">reported</a> as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/iphone-16-pro-demand-estimate/">news</a> ?</p><p> My thesis has long been that while Kuo clearly has <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/sunny-optical-to-benefit-significantly-from-apples-optical-order-growth-and-spec-upgrades-over-220ec84343ad">some insight</a> into <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/31/kuo-iphone-17-will-use-new-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-chip-made-in-house-by-apple/">some of Apple&#39;s suppliers</a> in Asia, he has <em>no insight whatsoever</em> into Apple&#39;s sales.他怎么可能？ “Apple&#39;s official websites” don&#39;t publish sales numbers. I think he just pulls this stuff right out of his ass and hand waves that it has something to do with the estimated ship dates for new iPhone models. Further, I think Kuo picks these numbers not at random, and not based on an honest attempt to even guess the actual sales, but rather to create headlines and inject his name into the news. Has he ever once issued a “survey” that reported that iPhone demand was pretty much in line with expectations? If all you did was follow Ming-Chi Kuo&#39;s reporting, you&#39;d think Jeff Williams is incompetent and should have been fired years ago, because he has no ability to accurately forecast demand for Apple&#39;s most important product. Clickbait in its purest form, detached completely from any factual reality.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Claim Chowder: Ming-Chi Kuo on Demand for the iPhone 16 Lineup’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/02/claim-chowder-kuo-iphones-16">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WorkOS Radar </title><link href="https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/02/workos-radar" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41629</id><published> 2025-03-02T21:50:23Z</published><updated> 2025-03-02T21:50:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

You call him a weirdo. This isn&#39;t some quirk or fluke. He&#39;s obviously some sort of eugenics freak who isn&#39;t interested in family or fatherhood, but in spreading his seed like he&#39;s some sort of prized racehorse. How is this any different than polygamy or assembling some sort of harem, other than that polygamists might live with and take an active role in raising their various children?</p><p> Think too about how conservative news outlets would portray any woman who had children with four different fathers (and counting).

<p>Nora Deligter, writing for Screen Slate in June 2023, “ <a href="https://www.screenslate.com/articles/elegy-screenshot">Elegy for the Screenshot</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> About five years ago, Catherine Pearson started taking screenshots of every bouquet featured on <em>The Nanny</em> (1993–1999), the six-season CBS sitcom that was then streaming on Netflix. She was just becoming a florist, and she found the arrangements — ornate, colorful, and distinctly tropical — inspirational. She now keeps them in a folder on her desktop, alongside screenshots of flower arrangements featured on <em>Poirot</em> (1989–2013), the British detective drama. A few months ago, however, Pearson suddenly found that when her fingers danced instinctively toward Command-Shift-3, she was greeted by a black box where her flowers used to be, a censored version of what she had meant to capture.</p><p> It was around this time when streaming platforms like Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, and the Criterion Channel imposed a quiet embargo on the screenshot. At first, there were workarounds: users could continue to screenshot by using the browser Brave or by downloading extensions or third-party tools like Fireshot. But gradually, the digital-rights-management tech adapted and became more sophisticated. Today, it is nearly impossible to take a screenshot from the most popular streaming services, at least not on a Macintosh computer. [...]</p><p> For PC users, this story takes a different, and happier, turn. With the use of Snipping Tool — a utility exclusive to Microsoft Windows, users are free to screen grab content from all streaming platforms. This seems like a pointed oversight, a choice on the part of streamers to exclude Mac users (though they make up a tiny fraction of the market) because of their assumed cultural class. This assumption isn&#39;t unreasonable. Out of everyone interviewed for this article, only one of them was a PC user.</p></blockquote><p> Deligter&#39;s essay has been sitting in my long (and ever-growing) list of things to link to ever since she published it back in 2023. I referenced it in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages">my post earlier today</a> re: <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/03/01/dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage-right-now/">Matthew Green&#39;s entreaty to Apple</a> to add “disappearing messages” to iMessage, and re-reading it made me annoyed enough to finally write about it.</p><p> I&#39;m not entirely sure what the technical answer to this is, but on MacOS, it seemingly involves the GPU and video decoding hardware. These DRM blackouts happen at such a low level that no high-level software — any sort of utility you might install — can route around them. I think Windows still offers easy screenshotting of frames from DRM video not because the streaming services somehow don&#39;t care about what Windows users do (which, when you think about it, would be a weird thing <em>not</em> to care about, given Windows&#39;s market share), but because Windows uses a less sophisticated imaging pipeline. Or perhaps rather than less <em>sophisticated</em> , it&#39;s more accurate to say less <em>integrated</em> . These DRM blackouts on Apple devices (you can&#39;t capture screenshots from DRM video on iPhones or iPads either) are enabled through the deep integration between the OS and the hardware, thus enabling the blackouts to be imposed at the hardware level. And I don&#39;t think the streaming services opt into this screenshot prohibition other than by “protecting” their video with DRM in the first place. If a video is DRM-protected, you can&#39;t screenshot it; if it&#39;s not, you can.</p><p> On the Mac, it used to be the case that DRM video was blacked-out from screen capture in Safari, but not in Chrome (or the dozens of various Chromium-derived browsers). But at some point a few years back, you stopped being able to capture screenshots from DRM videos in Chrome, too — <em>by default</em> . But in Chrome&#39;s Settings page, under System, if you disable “Use graphics acceleration when available” and relaunch Chrome, boom, you can screenshot everything in a Chrome window, including DRM video. You can go to the magic URL <code>chrome://gpu/</code> before and after toggling this setting to see a full report on the differences — as you&#39;d expect, it turns off all hardware acceleration for video encoding/decoding, compositing, and more. You wouldn&#39;t want to browse like this all the time (certainly not on battery power), but it&#39;s a great trick to know for capturing stills from videos.</p><p> What I don&#39;t understand is why Apple bothered supporting this in the first place for hardware-accelerated video (which is all video on iOS platforms — there is no workaround like using Chrome with hardware acceleration disabled on iPhone or iPad). No one is going to create bootleg copies of DRM-protected video one screenshotted still frame at a time — and even if they tried, they&#39;d be capturing only the images, not the sound. And it&#39;s not like this “feature” in MacOS and iOS has put an end to bootlegging DRM-protected video content. This “feature” accomplishes nothing of value for anyone, including the streaming services, but imposes a massive (and for most people, confusing and frustrating) hindrance on honest people simply trying to easily capture high-quality (as opposed to, say, using their damn phone to take a photograph of their reflective laptop display) screenshots of the shows and movies they&#39;re watching.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Why Can&#39;t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</title></entry><entry><title> Matthew Green: &#39;Dear Apple: Add “Disappearing Messages” to iMessage Right Now&#39; </title><link href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/03/01/dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage-right-now/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w49" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41625</id><published> 2025-03-01T19:06:10Z</published><updated> 2025-03-02T17:14:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

It&#39;s usually called “ <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/673193694148537">disappearing messages</a> ”, but sometimes goes by other names.</p><p> I&#39;m almost embarrassed to explain what this feature does, since it&#39;s like explaining how a steering wheel works.<em>尽管如此</em>。 When you start a chat, you can decide how long the messages should stick around for. If your answer is <em>forever</em> , you don&#39;t need to do anything. However, if it&#39;s a sensitive conversation and you want it to be ephemeral in the same way that a phone call is, you can pick a time, typically ranging from 5 minutes to 90 days. When that time expires, your messages just get erased — on both your phone and the phones of the people you&#39;re talking to.</p><p> A separate feature of disappearing messages is that some platforms will omit these conversations from device backups, or at least they&#39;ll make sure expired messages can&#39;t be restored. This makes sense because <em>those conversations are supposed to be ephemeral</em> : people are clearly not expecting those text messages to be around in the future, so they&#39;re not as angry if they lose them a few days early. [...]</p><p> To recap, nearly <em>every single other messaging product</em> that people use in large numbers (at least here in the US) has some kind of disappearing messages feature. Apple&#39;s omission is starting to be very unique.</p><p> I do have some friends who work for Apple Security and I&#39;ve tried to talk to them about this. [...] When I ask about disappearing messages, I get embarrassed sighs and crickets. Nobody can explain why Apple is so far behind on this basic feature even <em>as an option</em> , long after it became standard in every other messenger.</p></blockquote><p> I can only speculate why iMessage doesn&#39;t offer this feature. Perhaps Apple doesn&#39;t want to imply that “disappearing messages” are in any way <em>guaranteed</em> to be ephemeral, which would be impossible. Who&#39;s to say the recipient hasn&#39;t screenshotted them? And if Messages were to impose a software block against capturing a screenshot of a “disappearing message” (like the way <a href="https://www.screenslate.com/articles/elegy-screenshot">you can&#39;t capture screenshots of DRM-protected video</a> ), who&#39;s to say the recipient hasn&#39;t used another device to take a photograph of the display showing the ostensibly-ephemeral message? E2EE is a mathematical guarantee. There&#39;s no way to offer such a guarantee regarding ephemerality, and perhaps that gives Apple pause.</p><p> But I think that would be letting a desire for perfection get in the way of offering a feature that&#39;s useful and good enough. People who use disappearing messages on other platforms — and as Green points out, all of iMessage&#39;s rivals offer the feature — understand the risks. Vanishingly few people understand the difference between “encrypted in transit” and “end-to-end encrypted”. But just about everyone intuitively understands that even a “disappearing message” might be screenshotted, photographed, or otherwise recorded. There&#39;s an implicit trust between sender and recipient.</p><p> The other angle I can think of is complexity. Messages is one of Apple&#39;s most-used apps, and in many ways it exemplifies Apple&#39;s approach to software design and computing in general. Where critics see an app that is popular <em>despite</em> offering fewer features than its rivals, Apple (and I) see an app that is popular and beloved to some degree <em>because</em> it offers fewer features. All new features necessarily add some complexity, and disappearing messages would add quite a bit. Can you have two chats with the same person/group, one standard and one ephemeral? If so, now you&#39;ve raised the specter of accidentally sending what&#39;s intended to be a disappearing message to the non-ephemeral chat with that person or group. If not, how do you send a brief disappearing-message exchange with someone with whom you have a long archive of messages you want to keep forever? (Perhaps the idea of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105030">private browsing in Safari</a> could serve as an inspiration for disappearing messages in Messages — an entirely separate mode with a distinct visual state.)</p><p> The basic idea of disappearing messages is pretty trivial and easily understood. A good design for implementing them in Messages is not trivial. Solving these hard design problems is what makes Apple <em>Apple</em> , though. They&#39;ve added some rather superficial features to Messages ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/create-genmoji-with-apple-intelligence-iph4e76f5667/ios">Genmoji</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104970">message effects</a> for example), so I agree with Green that they <em>ought</em> to tackle disappearing messages and that surely they can find a way to do it where the added complexity doesn&#39;t create confusion. It&#39;s a hard challenge, to be sure, but a worthy one. Apple&#39;s designers could really have some fun with this too, with novel ways to present “disappearingness” visually.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Matthew Green: ‘Dear Apple: Add “Disappearing Messages” to iMessage Right Now’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta对错误表示歉意，这使Instagram充满了一些旧的超暴力</title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-apologizes-for-error-that-flooded-instagram-with-violent-content-c207d5f5" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w48" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-ultra-violence" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41624</id><published> 2025-02-28T23:40:41Z</published><updated> 2025-03-03T15:24:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>I&#39;ve spent the last six days using the iPhone 16e, and the experience has been a throwback. In many ways, the iPhone 16e both looks and feels like the modern-day progeny of the early Steve Jobs era iPhones. Early iPhones like the plastic 3G and 3GS, and the glass-back/metal-sides 4 and 4S were simpler offerings. Two colors, black and white. Single-lens inconspicuous cameras. The iPhone 16e feels like their direct descendent.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with the camera. With just a single lens on the back, the iPhone 16e camera doesn&#39;t just <em>look</em> less conspicuous compared to its dual- and triple-lens brethren, it <em>feels</em> less conspicuous. Especially for me, coming from several years of daily-driving an iPhone Pro model, the 16e feels strikingly smaller in hand and pocket because it lacks the entire “mesa” protrusion from which iPhone 16 and 16 Pro camera lenses further protrude.</p><p> Apple&#39;s tech specs for iPhone thickness don&#39;t include the camera lenses or camera mesas. Apple just measures and reports the thickness of the flat non-camera part of the phone. But those camera modules and lenses protrude quite a bit. Using a digital caliper, I measured the thickness of the three “levels” of the 16e, regular 16, and 16 Pro:</p><p><table class="table-1C94D92B-727A-4CC3-8A3B-18EA7E38C1D7" width = 350><style>

  /></a></p><p> The iPhone 16e looks like a phone with a tiny camera on the back. The iPhone 16 Pro looks like a camera that also happens to be a phone. You can really feel the difference in hand, too — not just the weight, but the balance. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-26">1</a></sup> You can feel that the 16 Pro&#39;s extra camera hardware adds extra weight. Per Apple&#39;s specs, the iPhone 16e weighs 167g; the 16 Pro 199g — a 16 percent difference. (Also take note of a clever touch: Apple&#39;s default wallpapers for each phone subtly suggest how many camera lenses they have.)</p><p> The 16e camera lens is not flush with the back of the phone, but it protrudes so little (just 1.7mm by my measurement) that it harks back to when iPhone cameras <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">first started jutting out</a> from the back of the phones at all. The 16e still wobbles when laid on a tabletop, but dramatically less than a regular iPhone 16 or especially the iPhone 16 Pro, whose camera module seems downright bulbous in comparison. But the 16e&#39;s 1.7mm camera lens protrusion is so minimal that, when put in a case, the phone <em>does</em> lay perfectly flat on a table, because the cases need no protective rim for the camera, because the 16e camera lens protrudes less than the thickness of the case. (Apple included two of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD3P4ZM/A/iphone-16e-silicone-case-white">$39 Silicone Cases</a> with my review kit, in blue and black. They&#39;re fine, and feel exactly like Apple&#39;s usual Silicone Cases.)</p><p> Because the “macro” mode on the recent regular and Pro iPhone models uses the 0.5× ultrawide camera, a secondary lens the 16e doesn&#39;t have, the 16e doesn&#39;t have a macro mode. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-macro-camera-a-big-day-for-small-things/">Starting with the iPhone 13 Pro</a> , macro mode has allowed iPhone Pros to focus on objects less than an inch away. But, because the 16e&#39;s 1× camera has a smaller sensor and smaller lens than the 1× camera on more expensive iPhone models, it&#39;s able to focus at shorter distances than those bigger and otherwise better 1× cameras. The 1× camera on an iPhone 16 Pro has a minimum focus distance of 24cm (~9.5 inches). The 1× camera on an iPhone 16e has a minimum focus distance of 12cm (~4.75 inches). Actual macro mode (on regular and Pro iPhone models) is better, but you don&#39;t need it as much when the 16e&#39;s lone camera can focus on objects at half the distance, just over 4 inches away, in its regular shooting mode.</p><p> The 16e&#39;s inconspicuous camera comes with a price, of course: image quality. You can really see the difference in low light. The 16e camera is slower (resulting in blurry images with subjects in motion) and images are noisier. The difference is especially obvious when shooting in low light with <a href="https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Process Zero in Halide</a> . It&#39;s a fine camera though, for point-and-shoot purposes. For most people who might be considering the iPhone 16e, it&#39;ll probably be the best camera they&#39;ve ever owned. And there&#39;s something to be said for the simplicity of just one lens, offering 1× and 2× fields of view. If you know what an ƒ-stop is, you probably shouldn&#39;t buy an iPhone 16e. If you don&#39;t know what an ƒ-stop is, you probably won&#39;t notice any difference in camera quality from an iPhone 16 or even 16 Pro. It&#39;s a perfect camera for anyone who just wants a decent camera.</p><h2> What&#39;s Missing: MagSafe, ProMotion, and Ultra Wideband (and, uh, the Other Ultra Wideband)</h2><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16-pro,iphone-16,iphone-16e">Peruse Apple&#39;s comparison page</a> , comparing the 16e to the 16 Pro and regular 16, and you&#39;ll spot dozens of small differences. But the one omission that grabbed the most attention (and generated the most “WTF Apple?” reactions) is MagSafe. I own a bunch of MagSafe peripherals, and personally would never want to buy an iPhone without it. I have <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-carbide">a dock</a> at my desk (great with <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-standby-iph878d77632/ios">StandBy mode</a> ), a <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger">charger at my nightstand</a> , and convenient doodads like <a href="https://www.moft.us/products/case-stand-wallet-snap-set?variant=39411246989399">this magnetic folding stand</a> . One week into using the 16e as my main phone, and I still miss MagSafe as much as I did the first night.</p><p> But according to Apple representatives, most people in the 16e&#39;s target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable. They tend not to use inductive charging at all, and when they do, they might not care that the 16e is stuck with a pokey 7.5W Qi charging speed, when recent more expensive iPhones charge via MagSafe at 15W or even 25W. For me, it&#39;s not the high charging speed I miss most; it&#39;s the snapping into place. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-26">2</a></sup> I think Apple knows the 16e&#39;s intended audience better than I do. Daring Fireball readers aren&#39;t in the 16e demographic; it&#39;s the friends and family members of DF readers who are.</p><p> What features do typical low-end iPhone buyers care about? They want a phone that looks good, with a good display, a decent camera, and long battery life. Do they care that the 16e only supports Wi-Fi 6, not 7? No, because they have zero idea what Wi-Fi version numbers even mean. They just think Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi. Do they care about superspeed mmWave 5G networking from Verizon (aka “ultra wideband”)? No. They just want their cellular connection to be fast and strong. (My review unit from Apple came with a temporary eSIM on AT&amp;T. Cellular connections were fast and strong all week. The only place where I noticed a weak signal was in a deeply suburban / borderline rural area while visiting family over the weekend; my wife&#39;s iPhone 15 Pro Max lost its signal on Verizon at the same location. I have zero complaints about Apple&#39;s C1 modem.)</p><p> The iPhone 16e also omits <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109021">the <em>other</em> “ultra wideband”</a> , the chip Apple uses for precise location detection — like tracking an AirPod to within a foot. Precision finding is super cool, and when you&#39;re truly bedeviled by a lost item like a keychain, remarkably helpful. Ultra wideband has been included on all new iPhones other than the SE (and now 16e) since the iPhones 11 in 2019. From a nerd&#39;s perspective, it really does seem like a curious omission from the 16e five years later. But how many people in your extended family know what “ultra wideband precision finding” is?</p><p> To date, only Apple&#39;s iPhone Pro models have supported ProMotion — Apple&#39;s marketing name for a display that features adaptive refresh rates that go up to 120 Hz and down to 1 Hz for the “Always On” display mode. Given that the regular iPhone 16 (and 16 Plus) don&#39;t support ProMotion, there was zero chance the 16e would. There are mid-range Android phones with high-refresh-rate displays, but (a) I don&#39;t think they&#39;re <em>better</em> displays, all things considered, and (b) they&#39;re mid-range Android phones. It&#39;s like bragging about the refresh rate on the dashboard display in a Kia Sorento. The 16e display also sports a throwback notch in lieu of the fancier, more playful, and at times cleverly useful, dynamic island.</p><p> The iPhone 16e targets the “I only care about the basics” iPhone buyer: the screen looks good, the camera is good but simple, the battery lasts a long time (the difference should be quite striking for anyone upgrading from a four- or five-year-old iPhone), it runs all their existing apps, and it charges fast when plugged into a USB cable. Those are the basics, and the basics are all that casual users care about. That it&#39;s lighter in weight and physically smaller thanks to its minimally protruding single camera lens is gravy.</p><h2>定价</h2><p>The only aspect of the 16e garnering more discussion than its omission of MagSafe is its starting price of $600 for a 128 GB base model. “It should cost $100 less” say some people, who tend to be the same people who <em>also</em> strongly believe it should include MagSafe and a ProMotion display. Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s current iPhone lineup, plus the discontinued (but <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022.html?q=iphone%20se">still</a> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-se-3rd-generation-64gb-unlocked-black/6507470.p?skuId=6507470">available</a> from <a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/prepaid-phones/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022-64gb-midnight">some</a> carriers) 3rd-generation SE: </p><table class="table-7940E2A4-0011-4258-A4DA-D506F80A4F67" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The new 16e starting at $600 makes more sense than the old SE starting at just $430. $600 is clearly the next logical “rung” under the year-old iPhone 15&#39;s $700 starting price. Complaining that Apple no longer makes a phone that&#39;s priced in the $400-500 range is like complaining that BMW no longer makes any cars that cost less than $40,000. They&#39;re Apple. It&#39;s an iPhone. Of course it costs more than a no-name Android phone, or the 27th model down the ladder in Samsung&#39;s sprawling product lineup. Anyone who wants to spend less than $600 for an iPhone can buy one from the flourishing pre-owned/refurbished market — just like buying a BMW for under $40,000.</p><p> The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don&#39;t want to think much about their phone. But they <em>do</em> want an iPhone, not just any “whatever” phone. A just plain iPhone, with a good screen, good enough (and simple) camera, and great battery life.

<p>Apple, in a very precisely worded statement issued to the media (including me) this morning:</p><blockquote><p> Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">As we have said many times before</a> , we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.</p></blockquote><p> The context for this is the news that broke two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM4OTA0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwMjg2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzg5MDQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImRiNmNkODlmLThiZjMtNDkwMy05ZjJlLTFkYmIxOGJmNTViNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDIvMDcvYXBwbGUtZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1iYWNrZG9vci11ay8ifQ.jmi16EkHDs4oV8NT_duwmo2NQd8rxE3enCtbFsh8KNU&amp;itid=gfta">by Joseph Menn in The Washington Post</a> , and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57b391a0-c531-4cde-a5e9-c5d60b21a161">Tim Bradshaw in the Financial Times</a> , that (quoting Menn&#39;s report, emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p> Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. The British government&#39;s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. [...]</p><p> The office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence, the people said. The law, known by critics as the Snoopers&#39; Charter, <em>makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand</em> . An Apple spokesman declined to comment.</p></blockquote><p> By definition, end-to-end encryption can have no secret backdoor, so compliance with this order from the UK would, in broad strokes, require Apple to abandon end-to-end encryption — not just for users in the UK but all users in all countries globally. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-21"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-21">1</a></sup> More insidiously and outrageously, they are apparently forbidden by UK law, under severe penalty (imprisonment), from even informing the public about this demand, or, if they were to comply, from telling the public what they&#39;ve done. The UK expects Apple to give them secret access to all iCloud data without Apple telling anyone — including, I believe, <em>even the US government</em> — that they&#39;ve granted the UK government this breathtaking access.</p><p> Rather than comply, Apple is choosing instead to pull Advanced Data Protection from the UK. For UK users not already using ADP, the ability to enable it was already turned off before Apple&#39;s statement was sent. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">This report from BBC News</a> has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/uk-adp-screenshot.jpeg">a screenshot</a> of what UK users see if they attempt to enable it today.</p><p> Re-read Apple&#39;s statement above, which I&#39;ve quoted in full, including the hyperlink. What stands out is that Apple is offering no explanation, not even a hint, <em>why</em> the company “can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the United Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually need to disable this security feature”. On issues pertaining to security and privacy, Apple always explains its policies and features as best it can. The fact that Apple has offered no hint as to why they&#39;re doing this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">canary statement</a> of sorts: they&#39;re making clear as best they can that they&#39;re under a legal gag order that prevents them from even acknowledging that they&#39;re under a legal gag order, by not telling us why they&#39;re no longer able to offer ADP in the UK. This sort of read-between-the-lines implicit confirmation that they&#39;re under a gag order is the only sort of confirmation they can legally offer, at risk of imprisonment.</p><p> Enabling ADP is controlled server-side, so Apple was able to disable the ability for UK users to turn on ADP without requiring a software update to devices. But it&#39;s an open question how this will play out for users in the UK who already have ADP enabled. Apple cannot disable ADP remotely. With a moment&#39;s thought, you can realize why they can&#39;t: it would defeat the entire purpose. In the same way that Apple can&#39;t hold its own key to decrypt a user&#39;s data with ADP, they also can&#39;t hold the ability to disable ADP.</p><p> Enabling ADP is reversible, however. After turning it on, a user can revert to standard protection, turning it off. But they must <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/adp-turn-off-screenshot.png">manually confirm</a> it. I suspect what Apple is going to do for UK users with ADP already enabled is begin issuing warnings, instructing them to disable it manually, before some deadline. Once that deadline passes, I think Apple will have to stop allowing iCloud access to ADP-protected accounts in the UK. That won&#39;t leave the data of those users unprotected — they simply will lose access to sync until they disable ADP and revert to standard protection.</p><p> The bottom line is that the UK government is proceeding like a tyrannical authoritarian state.那不是夸张。 And the breathtaking scope of their order — being able to secretly snoop, without notice that they even have the capability, not only on their own citizens but every Apple user in the entire world — suggests a delusional belief that the British Empire still stands. It&#39;s simultaneously infuriatingly offensive, mathematically ignorant (regarding the nature of end-to-end encryption), dangerous (as proven by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hack-us-telecoms-salt-typhoon-88cabc592dae2fa870772c5ce4ace5ea">recent Salt Typhoon attack</a> China successfully waged to eavesdrop on non-E2EE communications in the United States), and laughably naive regarding the UK&#39;s actual power and standing in the world.</p><p> Apple is, rightly and righteously, telling them to fuck off.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-21"><p> If you use Advanced Data Protection, your iCloud data can only be decrypted (a) by your own devices, (b) using the recovery key that you control from when you enabled ADP, or (c) by any recovery contacts you&#39;ve created in iCloud. Apple insists that you must generate a recovery key or specify at least one recovery contact to enable ADP. Lose your devices, lose your recovery key, and lose your iCloud passphrase, and no one, including Apple, can recover your iCloud data. That level of cryptographically guaranteed security is the benefit of ADP. It&#39;s also the risk of ADP. And there&#39;s a convenience cost. For example, web access to iCloud. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Quoting from Apple&#39;s own ADP documentation</a> :</p><blockquote><p> When a user first turns on Advanced Data Protection, web access to their data at iCloud.com is automatically turned off. This is because iCloud web servers no longer have access to the keys required to decrypt and display the user&#39;s data. The user can choose to turn on web access again, and use the participation of their trusted device to access their encrypted iCloud data on the web.</p><p> After turning on web access, the user must authorize the web sign-in on one of their trusted devices each time they visit iCloud.com. The authorization “arms” the device for web access. For the next hour, this device accepts requests from specific Apple servers to upload individual service keys, but only those corresponding to an allow list of services normally accessible on iCloud.com. In other words, even after the user authorizes a web sign-in, a server request is unable to induce the user&#39;s device to upload service keys for data that isn&#39;t intended to be viewed on iCloud.com, (such as Health data or passwords in iCloud Keychain). Apple servers request only the service keys needed to decrypt the specific data that the user is requesting to access on the web. Every time a service key is uploaded, it is encrypted using an ephemeral key bound to the web session that the user authorized, and a notification is displayed on the user&#39;s device, showing the iCloud service whose data is temporarily being made available to Apple servers.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s for reasons like “I lost my only device and forgot my iCloud password”, and to provide easy access to iCloud through the web, that Advanced Data Protection is not the default for all users.</p><p> I think it&#39;s technically possible that Apple could maintain “end-to-end encryption” in a pedantic sense while adding an additional UK-controlled signing key to all encrypted data in iCloud. Let&#39;s say you own two Apple devices, an iPhone and a Mac, and you use Advanced Data Protection. Your data can only be decrypted by those two devices, or by your recovery key, or by a device controlled by one of your recovery contacts. Apple could do something like add the UK government as, effectively, a recovery contact, to each and every user in the world&#39;s encrypted iCloud data. That would still be “end-to-end”, it&#39;s just that the UK government would control one of those end points. But the way iCloud security is designed, something like that cannot be added silently. When a new device is added to your iCloud account, all of your existing devices get a notification that a new device has been added. I personally see these notifications hundreds of times a year, every year, as I add new review unit devices to my account. Like back in September, I got four iPhone 16 review units, two Apple Watch review units, and purchased my own iPhone 16 Pro. And I own several Macs, several Apple Watches, and an iPad. Each one of those devices, when added to my iCloud account, even just temporarily for testing, generated a notification about the new device being added to my iCloud account to each and every one of my other devices, new or old, currently signed into my iCloud account. That&#39;s a minor annoyance for me as a product reviewer, but of course I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Apple&#39;s system is built such that new devices cannot be added to the chain without a notification being generated and sent to every existing device in your account. This notification regarding new devices happens even with standard protection — it&#39;s not exclusive to users who&#39;ve enabled ADP.</p><p> So while in theory some company could (I think?) build a system that is fairly (but deceptively) described as “end-to-end encrypted” where one of the “ends” is secretly and silently controlled by the UK government, Apple&#39;s iCloud is not such a system. Apple is prevented by UK law from explaining this, unfortunately, but I think it&#39;s true that as iCloud currently stands, Apple cannot comply with the UK&#39;s demands for ADP-protected accounts, because they can&#39;t add a UK-controlled decryption key to existing iCloud accounts without notifying every device signed into every account. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★苹果从英国撤离英国对全球后门的需求，从英国撤出高级数据保护</title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/thoughts_and_observations_on_todays_iphone_16e_announcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3b" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41591</id><published> 2025-02-20T04:42:10Z</published><updated> 2025-02-22T01:52:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch">Tim Cook teased</a> a “newest member of the family” product announcement coming today; turns out it was <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/">the iPhone 16e</a> , a device whose name briefly paralyzed me with indecision regarding how to capitalize it, <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-19"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-19">1</a></sup> which replaces the three-year-old iPhone SE (3rd generation) in the lineup.</p><h2> The Announcement</h2><p> Apple made the announcement in a 13-minute video that is currently atop their home page, but seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">only perma-linkable at YouTube</a> . (Maybe <a href="https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/iphone-16e/2025/d9015f23-5cc1-45b4-b25a-2b1caee9d7ac/films/announcement/iphone-16e-announcement-tpl-us-2025_16x9.m3u8">this</a> ?) It was also, of course, announced in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a press release on Apple Newsroom</a> . The first three minutes of the video feature Tim Cook (talking about how great iPhones are, the iPhones 16 in particular, and Apple Intelligence). Cook hands things off to iPhone product marketing VP Kaiann Drance for the next five minutes; Drance mostly recaps iOS 18&#39;s tentpole features, especially, of course, Apple Intelligence. Drance hands off to keynote first-timer (I think) Lucy Browning, a director of iPhone product design, who talks up the 16e specifics. The most unusual thing about the video is its setting: not Apple Park, not the Steve Jobs Theater, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I&amp;t=2727s">the infinite white void</a> , where, in a bygone era, Apple TV commercials like the famed Hodgman/Long “I&#39;m a Mac / I&#39;m a PC” series were set. (The new infinite void is arguably light gray, not white.)</p><h2>名字</h2><p>First, the name. It&#39;s not the fourth-generation iPhone SE, and instead sports an altogether new “e” suffix. Apple has used an “S” suffix with the iPhones 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS; “C” with the iPhone 5C, and “R” with the XR. We shall see if this “e” is a one-off. In an online press briefing today, when asked whether the “e” stands for anything, an Apple rep said no, it does not stand for anything, but that it&#39;s built for everyone. I don&#39;t think she meant to imply that the “e” secretly stands for <em>everyone</em> , if only because I&#39;m pretty sure Apple doesn&#39;t want everyone buying the lowest-price iPhone model. Apple never had an explanation for the “SE” name either, although in my head I&#39;ve already read that as maybe sorta kinda standing for <em>special edition</em> ? Way back in the day, I think Phil Schiller once said the “S” in “iPhone 3GS” stood for <em>speed</em> , because the 3GS was in fact strikingly faster than the prior year&#39;s 3G, and the “C” in “iPhone 5C” definitely, if unofficially, stood for <em>color</em> . But it&#39;s best not to waste too much time trying to find any logic to this other than that Apple thinks “iPhone 16e” looks and sounds cool. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not the “iPhone 16 AI”.</p><p> Using the “16” generation as part of the name is more interesting than the new “e” suffix. It perhaps suggests that e-edition phones might become annual. I wouldn&#39;t bet on that. But the SE models came out in March 2016, April 2020, and March 2022, so the gaps have been irregular. At the very least though, the 16e name will help make it clear, in years to come, what the basic specs of this iPhone were and when, roughly, it debuted. Every time I&#39;ve referenced the third-gen SE in the last year or two, I&#39;ve had to look up exactly when it debuted and which A-series chip it sported (A15, same as the iPhone 13).</p><h2>定价</h2><p>As expected, the existing third-gen iPhone SE is now out of the lineup. The third-gen SE debuted in March 2022 with a starting price of $430 (for a paltry 64 GB) with 128 and 256 GB configurations for, respectively, $480 and $580. The new iPhone 16e starts at $600, which, depending on how you look at it, is either a $170 increase (in the price of the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells) or a $120 increase (in the price of the cheapest 128 GB iPhone Apple sells). I&#39;ve already seen gobs of people arguing that the iPhone 16e “should” start at just $500, but if you look at Apple&#39;s pricing for the entire iPhone 16 lineup, there are $200 gaps, for the same storage tiers, between the 16e and regular 16, and between the regular 16 and 16 Pro. So I&#39;d argue that $600 is the “right” price. It&#39;s also worth pointing out that, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&#39;s inflation calculator</a> , $500 in January 2022 is about $565 in January 2025 dollars.</p><p> Here&#39;s a table with the lineup of new iPhones Apple currently sells. I&#39;m including the now-discontinued iPhone SE for reference. Also note that while these are the only models Apple itself sells to consumers, other old models are still sold by various carriers and retail partners around the world, including the iPhone SE for now. </p><table class="table-5EE26071-E20E-463E-860C-F4FEB8AD1841" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The 16e does support inductive Qi charging, but only at a pokey 7.5-watt rate. The regular 16 and 16 Pro models support MagSafe charging at up to 25 watts, and the iPhone 15 at 15 watts. You can charge an iPhone 16e using a MagSafe charging puck, but only at 7.5 watts, and it won&#39;t magnetically snap into place. It&#39;ll just function as a non-magnetic pad. I don&#39;t know if this decision was about component pricing (the $200 difference has to come from somewhere, and it&#39;s not going to be Apple&#39;s margins), the internal space that MagSafe components occupy in the device (see next section), or marketing differentiation. Probably some combination of all three. The old SE only supported 7.5-watt no-MagSafe Qi charging as well.</p><h2>电池</h2><p>Battery life is better than the regular iPhone 16. This is equally surprising to me. From Apple&#39;s own Comparison page:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/iphones-16-battery-compare.png" class="noborder"><img

    alt="Screenshot of Apple's comparison of battery life specs between the iPhone 16 Pro, 16, and 16e."
    width = 525
  /></a></p><p> How exactly is the 16e achieving battery life that surpasses the more expensive iPhone 16, and is effectively on par with the much more expensive iPhone 16 Pro? I suspect it&#39;s a combination of a larger battery and a more efficient cellular modem. As rumored, the 16e is Apple&#39;s first iPhone with an in-house–designed modem, which, in the video, Kaiann Drance introduces thus (emphasis added): “And with iPhone 16e, we&#39;re expanding the benefits of Apple silicon with C1, the first Apple-designed cellular modem. It provides fast and reliable 5G connectivity, and <em>it&#39;s the most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone</em> .” Just as with CPUs and GPUs, Apple&#39;s interest in custom silicon isn&#39;t only about price and performance — it&#39;s about efficiency too. <a href="https://youtu.be/mFuyX1XgJFg?t=199">Drance then continues</a> (speaking over a cool breakaway animation of the 16e&#39;s internal components), “We combined the incredible power efficiency of Apple silicon with an all-new internal design for iPhone 16e that has been optimized for a larger battery. Together, it paves the way for an unprecedented level of battery life in a 6.1-inch iPhone.” There might be other changes that allow the 16e to accommodate a larger battery than the regular 16, but from the spec sheet, the obvious one is the omission of MagSafe.</p><h2> Apple&#39;s C1 Chip</h2><p> The power efficiency sounds great, and of course the modem supports “5G”, but it doesn&#39;t support mmWave / ultra wideband, the crazy super-fast variant of 5G with Wi-Fi-like speed <em>and</em> Wi-Fi-like short range from carrier antennas that serve it. Block-by-block here at home in Philadelphia, I see ultra wideband from Verizon on some blocks of the city ( <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118203">denoted by the “5G UW” icon in the status bar</a> ), but not most. But do I really care? I honestly don&#39;t know why I&#39;m supposed to care about 5G at all compared to LTE. Using LTE instead of 5G (let alone 5G ultra wideband) makes no practical difference for anything I do over cellular on my phone. Obviously Apple wants to support ultra wideband in its own modems eventually, but their renewed deal with Qualcomm — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">announced and crowed-about only by Qualcomm</a> , because Apple despises them and deeply resents its own dependence upon them — covers “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026”. So I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see a C-series chip in this September&#39;s expected iPhone 17 or 17 Pro — but perhaps we&#39;ll see one in the rumored iPhone 17 “Air”.</p><p> Remember too that when last I saw it tested — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/5g-battery-life">by Nicole Nguyen in 2022</a> — disabling 5G and exclusively using LTE extended the battery life of an iPhone 13 Pro from 13 to 15.5 hours in her video-streaming test. Ultra wideband 5G <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">is indeed insanely fast</a> , and regular 5G is generally faster than LTE, but for most people in most places not in ways that practically matter, especially considering the effects on battery life. “Plenty fast enough, with longer battery life” is a better trade-off than “way faster than you&#39;ll notice, with somewhat shorter battery life”.</p><p> Speaking of wireless, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the C1 chip, but the iPhone 16e supports only Wi-Fi 6, not 7, and doesn&#39;t support Thread networking.</p><h2> Just One Camera on the Back, but It&#39;s “2-in-1”</h2><p> No surprise here — cameras are expensive, and only offering one makes for very obvious differentiation. Apple&#39;s calling this lone camera “2-in-1” because, like the main camera on other recent iPhone models, it offers both 1× and 2× <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6110937480">optical fields of view</a> (1× uses the entire 48MP sensor, producing a 12MP image by treating the sensor pixel array as “quad pixels; 2× produces 12MP images by cropping the center 12MP of the sensor). The lack of a second ultra-wide camera means not just no 0.5× lens, but also no macro photography, and no spatial photos or video. The 16e also offers only “Photographic Styles”, not the “latest-generation Photographic Styles” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_iphones_16#photography">offered by the 16 and 16 Pro</a> .</p><p> If you really care about your <em>camera</em> , the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t the iPhone for you. As mentioned above, it has fewer lenses and the imaging pipeline doesn&#39;t support the next-generation Photographic Styles (which, five months in, I continue to really enjoy in my own photography). But that doesn&#39;t mean the iPhone 16e isn&#39;t a valid choice for people who care about their photos. Some people really do care about their photography, but also really just point and shoot using their main 1× camera, no matter which iPhone model they own. Not worrying about camera hardware and only concerning yourself with lighting and framing is a philosophy shared by many seriously talented photographers.</p><h2> No Camera Control Button</h2><p> The other camera-hardware-related ding against the 16e is that it doesn&#39;t have the new Camera Control button/slider on the side. I know several iPhone 16 owners who claim they never use it or even flat out dislike it, because they find themselves invoking it only by accident. I really like it, and use it as my primary way to launch the Camera app and to capture images. But, you know, we all captured images and videos just fine for 17 iPhone generations without that hardware button. No matter how much you like it, you certainly don&#39;t need it.</p><p> But, up until now, you <em>did</em> need the Camera Control button to invoke <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-visual-intelligence-with-camera-control-iph12eb1545e/ios">the visual intelligence feature of Apple Intelligence</a> . A press-and-release of Camera Control launches your favorite camera app; a long-press invokes visual intelligence. Apple&#39;s solution to enable visual intelligence on the iPhone 16e, despite it lacking the Camera Control button, is two-fold. First, visual intelligence is now available in Control Center. Second, as demonstrated by Apple in the announcement video, you can assign the Action Button to visual intelligence. (By default, just as with other iPhones equipped with the Action Button, it defaults to toggling silent mode, like the dedicated ringer switch of yore — where by “yore” I mean still on the iPhone 15.)</p><p> Apple representatives also told me today that owners of the iPhone 15 Pro will soon be able to bind their Action Button to visual intelligence, “in a future software update”. I suspect that future software update is iOS 18.4, which should be launching in beta any day now, but Apple wouldn&#39;t comment, on or off the record, when exactly this feature will come to the iPhone 15 Pro. They also confirmed that the Control Center button to launch visual intelligence is also coming to iPhone 15 Pro (and presumably iPhone 16 models, too). The iPhone 15 Pro, despite qualifying for Apple Intelligence, has heretofore lacked the visual intelligence feature, because the visual intelligence feature has only been trigger-able via the Camera Control button. It&#39;s a little odd, frankly, that Apple didn&#39;t enable this feature via the Action Button and Control Center for 15 Pro users months ago — perhaps they really wanted to wait for the 16e announcement?</p><h2>展示</h2><p>The 16e display specs seem pretty good, but the front sensor array is behind a notch, not a dynamic island. That&#39;s a reasonable design trade-off for the lowest-price model. The 16 and 16 Pro displays offer maximum brightness specs of 1,000 nits (typical), 1,600 nits (HDR), and 2,000 nits (outdoor). The 16e display offers 800 nits (typical), 1,200 (HDR), and doesn&#39;t go higher than that. The 16 and 16 Pro dislays also go down to just 1 nit minimum brightness; Apple doesn&#39;t list a minimum brightness for the 16e display.</p><h2>硅</h2><p>The A18 chip in the iPhone 16e seems (on the specs page) nearly identical to that of the iPhone 16, except for the number of GPU cores: the 16e has only 4 GPU cores, but the regular iPhone 16 has 5. (The A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max has 6 GPU cores.) No big whoop.</p><p> What&#39;s more interesting than comparing to the iPhone 16 is comparing to the iPhone 15, which costs $100 more than the 16e. Because the only A17-generation chip was the A17 Pro that went into the iPhone 15 Pro models, the regular iPhone 15 has the same A16 chip from the iPhone 14 model year. Aside from all the general performance improvements in the A18 compared to the two-year-old A16, the big functional difference is that the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 15 does not. As covered extensively when Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC last June, that&#39;s mainly a function of RAM, but whatever the reasons, the less expensive iPhone 16e has Apple Intelligence, and the iPhone 15 does not. Maybe that&#39;s not a <em>big</em> whoop, but it&#39;s definitely a whoop of some sort.</p><p> Perhaps, like the three generations of SE models, the iPhone 16e is designed to stay around for several years at this price point. If it does, the fact that it costs $100 less than the “year-old regular iPhone” will make more sense come September, when that $700 year-old model is the iPhone 16. But until September, the iPhone 16e looks like a better phone in several ways than the iPhone 15. It has a faster chip that supports Apple Intelligence and significantly longer battery life. The iPhone 15 does have a 0.5× ultra-wide camera, and it has a slightly better display (that includes the nicer dynamic island instead of a notch). And of course the iPhone 15 comes in colors like pink, yellow, green, and blue. But if you keep your phone in a case all the time, like most people do, you probably don&#39;t care about the color of your phone much. The iPhone 16e is arguably just plain a better phone than the iPhone 15, and I think it&#39;s almost inarguably a better value at $100 less.</p><h2>颜色</h2><p>You can get any color 16e that you want, so long as it&#39;s black or white. The third-gen iPhone SE came in midnight, starlight, and Product Red. (Is Apple done partnering with Product Red now? I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/apple-marks-world-aids-day-with-red/">Apple Watch Series 9 was the last device offered with Product Red</a> .)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-19"><p> For a while with the iPhone 4S, there was some ambiguity whether Apple intended the “S” to be upper- or lowercase, because their marketing materials used a small-cap “S”, and a small-cap “S” looks almost exactly like a lowercase “s”. They settled on uppercase for the 4S. But when the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, Apple not only styled both of those suffixes lowercase, they retroactively re-styled the &#39;S&#39; in the &#39;4S&#39; as lowercase. I wrote about this at length <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c#fn1-2013-09-17">in this footnote in my iPhone 5S and 5C review in 2013</a> , in which I explained my decision to uppercase them. But I sort of like the way “16e” looks. It&#39;s ... friendly? And the lowercase “e” carries the correct implication that this is a lesser sibling to the regular iPhone 16, not an upgrade or superior of some sort. So for now, I&#39;m going with the flow and keeping the “e” lowercase. One friend, to whom I vented my consternation regarding how to handle this, unhelpfully suggested I go with <em>iPhone 16ᵉ</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Thoughts and Observations on Today&#39;s iPhone 16e Announcement</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
