<p>苹果新闻编辑室：</p><blockquote><p>借助 Apple Vision Pro 上的 NBA 应用程序，篮球迷可以通过多视图直播或点播多达 5 个直播节目，关注实时球员和球队统计数据，并轻松浏览其他比赛和比分。 MLB 让用户沉浸在棒球场中，可以看到本垒板的视图和每个球场的统计数据。 Red Bull TV 显示比赛的 3D 地图，并配有高质量视频和身临其境的环境。足球迷可以在美国职业足球大联盟 (Major League Soccer) 的主场 Apple TV 应用程序上访问 MLS Season Pass。兼容来自顶级有线电视服务公司（包括 Charter Spectrum、Comcast Xfinity、Cox Contour、Sling TV 和 Verizon Fios）以及体育广播公司（包括 ESPN、CBS、Paramount+、NBC、NBC Sports、Peacock、FOX Sports 和 UFC）的应用程序Vision Pro 用户始终拥有室内最好的座位。</p><p>除了 Disney+ 之外，顶级娱乐应用程序还利用 Apple Vision Pro 的独特功能，为观众提供观看他们喜爱的电影、节目等的全新方式。 IMAX 为 2D 和 3D 内容提供令人惊叹的观看体验，其中以 IMAX 扩展宽高比的<em>《深空》</em>等流行纪录片为特色。</p><p>华纳兄弟探索频道 (Warner Bros. Discovery) 的 Max 提供热门电影和连续剧、新鲜原创作品、家庭最爱、突发新闻和体育直播，其中精选影片提供 4K 和杜比全景声 (Dolby Atmos) 空间音频。 HBO 和 Max Content 董事长兼首席执行官 Casey Bloys 表示：“借助 Apple Vision Pro 的 Max 应用程序，粉丝们可以利用铁王座房间环境改造他们的空间，获得身临其境的体验，将观众带入标志性的红堡。” “错综复杂的坦格利安时代的装饰会让粉丝们感觉他们正在观看维斯特洛麦克斯在统治鼎盛时期播放的节目。”</p></blockquote><p>尽管 Netflix 和 YouTube 在发布时决定完全避开该平台，但事实是，在发布时有<em>很多</em>原生 VisionOS 应用程序，以及无数兼容的 iPad 应用程序。还有<a href="https://mastodon.social/@jamesthomson/111858221733883492">一个很棒的计算器应用程序</a>和<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccsMSGVBoxQ">一个很棒的日历应用程序</a>。</p><p> （Apple 在 VisionOS 中没有内置计算器应用程序，而内置日历应用程序是兼容模式下的 iPad 应用程序，这使得 PCalc 和 Fantastical 成为 App Store 中<em>唯一</em>同类的原生应用程序。）</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“PCalc、Fantastical 和超过 598 个其他原生 VisionOS 应用程序将于发布日在 App Store 中提供”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/01/pcalc-and-599-other-visionos-apps">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vai" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2024://1.40554</id><published> 2024-01-30T20:00:35Z</published><updated> 2024-02-02T06:00:48Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">耳机、空间生产力平台和个人娱乐设备。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>在过去的六天里，我一直在同时测试苹果公司的三款全新产品。第一个是带有眼球追踪控制的 VR/AR 耳机。第二个是革命性的空间计算生产力平台。第三是突破性的个人娱乐设备。</p><p>耳机、空间生产力平台和个人娱乐设备。</p><p>我相信你已经明白了。这些不是三个独立的设备。它们是一个：Apple Vision Pro。但如果你能原谅对史蒂夫·乔布斯著名的 iPhone 介绍的无耻致敬，我认为这三个角度是考虑它的最佳方式。</p><h2>硬件</h2><p>Vision Pro 的盒子大得出奇。我原本期待一个与 HomePod 盒子大小差不多的包裹；相反，Vision Pro 零售盒<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/homepods-v-vision-pro.jpeg">比<em>两个</em>堆叠在一起的 HomePod 盒要大得多</a>。 （我拥有的 HomePod 比大多数人都多。）</p><p>里面有很多东西。包装的上半部分包含 Vision Pro 耳机本身，以及已安装的轻质密封件、轻质密封垫和默认的 Solo 针织表带。下半部分包含电池、充电器 (30W)、电缆、双环带、入门书（精美的全彩印刷、精美的纸张 - 感觉就像纪念品）、抛光布<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-30"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-30">1</a></sup> 、和一个额外的轻质密封垫。</p><p>要打开 Vision Pro，请将外部电池组的电源线连接到 Vision Pro 的电源连接器，然后将其旋转四分之一圈以将其锁定到位。耳机一毛钱大小的电源插座上有一些小点，显示如何对齐电缆连接器的小 LED。 Vision Pro 打开时，LED 会闪烁。 （我怀念苹果发光的电源指示灯 LED — 这是一种非常令人愉悦的触感。）当 Vision Pro 完成启动并准备使用时，它会发出令人愉悦的欢迎声音。</p><p>然后戴上 Vision Pro。如果您使用的是 Solo 针织表带，则可以使用右耳后面的表带上的旋钮来收紧和松开它。 VisionOS 会指导您适当升高或降低耳机，将其放置在您脸部相对于眼睛的正确高度。如果Vision Pro认为您的眼睛离显示器太近，它会建议您切换到“+”尺寸的光密封垫。您会得到两个轻质密封垫，但它们并不相同：我的标有“W”和“W+”。 “+”的宽度相同，以匹配您的光密封，但会在您的眼睛和 Vision Pro 内的显示屏之间增加一点点空间。对我来说，默认的（非“+”）就很合适。</p><p>然后，该软件将引导您通过一系列屏幕来校准眼动追踪。这一切都非常明显，而且很有趣。这几乎就像一个简单的游戏：你盯着圆圈中的一系列点，并在盯着每个点时捏住你的食指和拇指。您会在三种不同的人工照明条件下经历三次这样的过程：黑暗、中等和明亮。在首次运行体验即将结束时，系统会提示您将 iPhone 或 iPad 放在附近，就像设置新 iPhone 或 iPad 时一样。这允许您的 Vision Pro 获取您的 Apple ID 凭据和 Wi-Fi 密码，而无需手动输入任何内容。这是一个非常顺利的入职过程。就这样，您就进入并使用了 Vision Pro。</p><p> Vision Pro 硬件的一些基本问题是无法回避的。</p><p>首先，它使用通过电源线连接的外部电池组。电池本身的宽度和高度与 iPhone 15/15 Pro 差不多，但更厚。而且电池很重：约 325 克，而 iPhone 15 Pro 为 187 克，15 Pro Max 为 221 克。它的厚度和重量更接近<em>两部</em>iPhone 15，而不是一部。而且拴着的电源线可能会很麻烦。 Vision Pro 没有内置备用电池 - 从耳机上拔下电源线，耳机会立即关闭。它牢固地卡入到位，因此不存在意外断开连接的风险。但如果你花<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW283LL/A/apple-vision-pro-battery">200 美元购买一块额外的 Vision Pro 电池</a>，你就不能热插拔它们——你需要先关机。</p><p>其次，Vision Pro<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/20/vision-pro-weight">很重</a>。我一次使用它几个小时，没有任何不适，但仅从重量来看，疲劳感确实出现了。你永远不会忘记你戴着它。与 Vision Pro 的重量相关的是它相当大。你脸上戴着一副又大又重的护目镜。无论是从你佩戴它的第一人称视角，还是从你佩戴它时其他人看着你的第三人称视角来看，它都没有什么微妙之处。</p><p> Apple 关于调整 Vision Pro 在脸部位置的建议之一是平衡前额和脸颊之间脸部的重量/压力。我发现这是个好建议。最初，我的直觉是将其放置在我脸上稍微太低的位置，这导致系统建议将其放置得更高。它需要正好放置在您的脸上，以便您通过其显示屏看得清楚，并且它可以通过 Optic ID（Vision Pro 相当于 Face ID）看到您的眼睛，用于解锁设备并确认需要身份验证的操作（例如访问来自钥匙串或购买应用程序的密码）。一两天之内，我就很自然地穿上它，无需为合身而大惊小怪。</p><p>默认的弹力单圈针织带不仅适合我，而且从舒适性和便利性方面来说，我更喜欢它，而不是双环带。使用 Solo 针织带时，您可以将其戴上并通过扭转上述旋钮来收紧。当你把它取下来时，你先松开它。您希望它在脸上足够紧，以至于每次戴上/脱下时不必收紧/松开它是不切实际的。这有点像习惯新的表带——一开始感觉很挑剔，但你很快就会形成肌肉记忆。除了了解将 Vision Pro 放在脸上的高度之外，尝试一下 Solo Knit Band 在<em>后脑勺</em>上的高度对于获得一致的贴合度至关重要。</p><p>为什么 Vision Pro 配备了完全不同的双环带设计？ Apple 的入门指南用一种美妙的委婉说法描述了其目的：“Apple Vision Pro 还配备了双环表带，如果您想要不同的佩戴方式，这是一个不错的选择。”翻译：如果 Solo 针织带不舒服，您应该尝试一下。 Vision Pro 是一款非常个人化的设备。它不仅在你的脸上，因为它对感觉和触觉非常敏感，而且它很重，需要与你的眼睛精确对齐。您还确实希望光密封能够隔绝光线。<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/19ardw5/all_light_seal_sizes/">这篇 Reddit 帖子</a>建议光密封有 28 种不同的尺寸。 28！ （我认为 N 和 W 分别代表<em>窄</em>和<em>宽</em>。）根据您的脸型、头部大小和头发量，单人针织带可能效果不佳。双环带有两条尼龙搭扣带 - 一条穿过后脑勺，另一条穿过顶部。使用双环带的用户每次佩戴和摘下 Vision Pro 时可能都需要松开和收紧两条带子。</p><p>如果这一切听起来有点繁琐，那是因为它确实如此。但没有办法解决这个问题：它需要精确的配合才能保证舒适度和光学对准。</p><p>许多人注意到，对于一家推出健身相关设备（Watch）和服务（Fitness+）的公司的产品来说，Vision Pro 没有健身相关的营销角度。实在是太重了。没有人愿意将 650 克的设备绑在脸上进行锻炼。有一天，苹果会推出一款适合健身的 Vision 耳机；这个Vision Pro不是吗。</p><p>另一个需要一些时间来适应的方面是简单地处理 Vision Pro。您需要学会通过设备本身周围的铝框而不是光密封来固定它。尝试握住它或通过光密封将其拿起，密封将会弹出。光密封件通过磁性附着在 Vision Pro 上，光密封垫通过磁性附着在密封件上。它们很容易安装和拆卸，并自动卡入到位 - 但如果您使用轻型密封件（或垫子）来拾取组合单元，它们就会拆卸。 （适用于眼镜佩戴者的蔡司镜片插件也可以通过磁性卡入到位，并且插入和取出都很简单。）</p><p>您无需在摘下 Vision Pro 前将其置于睡眠状态，也无需在佩戴时将其唤醒。您只需将其脱下并戴上，系统就会自动检测您是否正在使用它。您可以永久保留电池。</p><p>我怀疑Vision Pro的正面很容易被划伤。这是一种需要小心处理的设备。苹果公司的说明建议每次使用完后盖上盖子，就像喝完碳酸饮料后将盖子盖回瓶子上一样。我认为它本身并不精致，但它绝对不坚固。</p><p>我的评测套件包括<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2F3LL/A/apple-vision-pro-travel-case">Apple 价值 200 美元的旅行箱</a>。与 Vision Pro 零售盒一样，我发现它大得出奇。它会占用大多数笔记本电脑背包内的大部分内部空间，事实上，旅行箱本身的大小大约相当于一个小孩的背包。我非常期待在旅行时使用 Vision Pro，但您需要计划一下您的行李。 <sup id="fnr2-2024-01-30"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-30">2</a></sup></p><p>在两周前的一篇短文中——在我在家评测这个设备之前，但在纽约与苹果公司进行了另一次动手演示之后——<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/vision-pro-battery">我写道</a>：</p><blockquote><p>几乎每一个第一代产品都存在这样的问题——由于技术的限制而存在明显的缺陷。最初的 Mac 的 RAM (128 KB) 和存储空间（单个<a href="https://lowendmac.com/2016/floppy-disk-compatibility-and-incompatibility-in-the-mac-world/">400 KB 单面软盘驱动器</a>）太少。最初的 iPhone 仅支持 2G EDGE 蜂窝网络，速度<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_rates_for_GSM_Evolution#:~:text=EDGE%20can%20carry%20a%20bandwidth,much%20traffic%20as%20standard%20GPRS.">慢得不可思议</a>，而且在语音通话时根本无法使用。最初的 Apple Watch 速度非常慢，一次充电很难坚持一整天。第一代 Vision Pro 的外部电池组仅提供 2 至 2.5 小时的电池续航时间。此外，Vision Pro 耳机本身（没有任何内置电池）仍然太大太重。</p><p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/really.html">保罗·格雷厄姆有一句精彩的格言</a>：</p><blockquote><p>不要担心人们会说什么。如果您的第一个版本令人印象深刻，以至于巨魔不会取笑它，那么您等待发布的时间太长了。</p></blockquote></blockquote><p> Vision Pro 还没上市，就已经受到嘲笑。 （发货前的 iPhone 也是如此；最初的 Macintosh 也是如此。）几年后，在几代产品之后，我们<em>都会</em>在回顾第一台 Vision 设备时大笑。我们会嘲笑外部电池，我们会嘲笑设备的尺寸和重量，最终我们会嘲笑它的价格。无可否认，对它的批评都是真实的：它对每个人来说都太重、太大，而且对大众市场来说太贵。</p><p>但是，就像第一代 iPhone 和之前的第一代 Macintosh 一样，第一代 Vision Pro 并不是开玩笑。</p><h2> VisionOS平台</h2><p>早在 6 月份，在 WWDC 上进行了 30 分钟的 Vision Pro 演示后，我写道：</p><blockquote><p>苹果<a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1665806600261763072">将</a>​​ Vision Pro 的发布宣传为“空间计算时代”的到来。这个词感觉很完美。这不是 AR、VR 或 XR。这是空间计算，空间计算的某些<em>方面</em>是AR或VR。</p><p>对我来说，麦金塔电脑更像是一个<em>地方</em>，而不是一个<em>东西</em>。不是我身体上去的地方，而是我思想上智力上去的地方。当我工作或玩耍时，总感觉 MacOS 就是我<em>所在的</em>地方。我在Mac上。当我在 Mac 上工作时，干扰（例如门铃或电话铃声）会暂时让我迷失方向，因为我被拉出了那个世界，进入了现实世界。 iOS 也有类似的效果，但我总觉得它没那么深刻。部分原因是 iOS 的本质，它不像 MacOS 那样对我说话。我认为这在很多方面解释了为什么我在 iPad 上的感觉不像在 Mac 上那样<em>流畅</em>，即使显示屏尺寸相同。但对于 iPhone，尤其是屏幕尺寸是一个重要因素。我认为<em>任何</em>假想的手机操作系统都不可能像 MacOS 那样具有沉浸感，因为即使是最大的手机显示屏也很小。在手机上看电影的体验不如在大电视机上看电影，甚至在大电视上看电影也比在漂亮的剧院看电影的体验差。我们人类是视觉动物，我们的视野会影响我们的重要性感。大小事项。</p><p>可以说，MacOS 和 iOS（或 Windows、Android 或其他）的<em>世界</em>是由它们运行的​​显示器定义和限制的。如果说 MacOS 是我工作时精神上所去的地方，那么这个地方就通过 Mac 的显示屏来体现。这就像体育运动中的比赛场地或球场——它有非常清晰、坚硬和快速的矩形边界。它具有固定的大小和形状，我在那个世界中所做的一切都发生在这些显示边界的范围内。</p><p> VisionOS 很可能会成为一个类似于工作场所的概念性场所。但没有任何显示。没有界限。 VisionOS 应用程序呈现的智能“场所”是您使用设备的现实世界场所，或者是您选择的广阔虚拟环境。你所坐的房间就是画布。整个房间。 Mac 或 iOS 设备上的显示屏对我来说就像一个门户，一个进入明确定义的虚拟世界的矩形窗口。借助 VisionOS，虚拟世界就是您周围的现实世界。</p><p>就像 iPhone 引入的多点触控消除了一层概念抽象一样 — 您只需触摸屏幕上的对象，而不是触摸鼠标或触控板将屏幕上的指针移动到屏幕上的对象 — VisionOS 消除了空间抽象层。使用 Mac 时，您位于一个物理位置，该位置前面有一个显示器，该显示器上有应用程序窗口。使用 VisionOS，您所在的物理位置只有应用程序窗口。周一，我并排打开了 Safari、消息和照片，每个窗口都像电影海报一样大小——也就是说，窗口中的每个应用程序都比我见过的任何实际计算机显示器都大用过的。一切并排。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Apple Newsroom 帖子中介绍 Vision Pro 的一些视频</a>就说明了这一点。但是，在这种环境中看到演员的照片并不能真正亲身体验它，因为显示这种环境的照片本身已经定义了矩形边框。</p><p>这并不令人困惑或复杂，但感觉很深刻。</p></blockquote><p>这可能是我在文章中包含的最长的块引用。但在使用 Vision Pro 近一周后，我现在无法比当时更好了。在最初 30 分钟的经历之后，我的预感是完全正确的。</p><p>第一代 Vision Pro<em>硬件</em>受到当前技术限制的严重限制。苹果已经通过多种方式突破了这些限制，但这些限制是显而易见的。 Vision Pro 是一款落地耳机，定义了沉浸式耳机技术的最新技术水平。但随着岁月的流逝，这块土地将在后视镜中消失。就像 Mac 的 9 英寸单色 512⁠×⁠342 像素显示屏一样。就像 iPhone 的 EDGE 蜂窝调制解调器一样。</p><p>但VisionOS的概念设计为交互设计的全新方向奠定了基础。就像最初的 Mac 界面的基本概念是完全正确的一样，并且至今仍然如此。就像最初的 iPhone 定义了现在世界上每部手机的工作方式一样。</p><p>没有实用的方法可以让 Mac 或 PC 周围有多个外部显示器，从而为自己提供 VisionOS 中工作区大小的工作区画布。 VisionOS 工作空间不是<em>无限的</em>，但它感觉尽可能接近无限大。这是你周围的世界。</p><p>而且非常有<em>空间感</em>。窗户仍然固定在您周围的世界中。设置几个窗户，然后站起来走开，当你回来时，那些窗户就在你离开的地方。穿过它们真是不可思议。 （从后面看，它们看起来是白色的。）您可以做看似疯狂的事情，例如将 VisionOS 应用程序窗口放在现实世界窗口之外。</p><p>窗口也保持它们相对于彼此的位置。按一下数字表冠按钮即可调出 VisionOS 主视图。长按数字表冠按钮可根据您当前的视线重新调整视图。因此，举例来说，如果一切在您看来都显得太低，请向上看，然后按住数字表冠。所有打开的窗口都将重新集中在您当前的视野中。但当你站起来移动时，这也有效。</p><p>你可以开始在厨房等地方工作。打开“消息”、“Safari”和“便笺”。从左到右排列您周围的三个窗口。站起来，走到客厅。这些窗户仍然在你的厨房里。坐在沙发上，按住数字表冠。现在，这些窗户移动到您的客厅，重新以您当前的视线为中心，但彼此之间的位置和大小完全相同。这就像拥有一个多显示器设置，您可以轻松移动到您想去的任何地方。</p><p>几十年的 Mac 使用经验让我认为窗口控件位于窗口的顶部。在 VisionOS 中，它们位于底部。这花了我一两天的时间来适应——当我想到“我想关闭这个窗口”时，我的眼睛自然会转向左上角。 VisionOS 窗口实际上只有三个控件：一个关闭按钮和下面的“窗口栏”，以及每个角落的调整大小指示器。一旦你开始使用它，就很容易明白为什么苹果把窗口栏放在底部而不是顶部：如果它在顶部，当你拖动窗口来移动它时，你的手和手臂会遮挡窗口内容。由于该栏位于底部，因此移动窗口内容时根本不会被遮挡。</p><p> VisionOS 工作空间看起来如此广阔的部分原因是它完全自然地使用 Z 轴（深度）。拖动窗口时，将其拉近或推远就像向左或向右移动一样容易。旋转它们，将窗口排列在您周围的半圆形中，也是完全自然的。这就像科幻小说一样令人兴奋。 Mac 自 40 年前诞生以来，一直有 Z 轴的概念，用于将窗口堆叠在一起，但有了 VisionOS，情况就完全不同了。在 VisionOS 中，窗口停留在您放置它们的深度，而在 Mac 上，当您激活它们时，窗口会弹出到堆栈的前面。</p><p>长按窗口的关闭按钮，您可以选择关闭所有其他打开的窗口，就像 Mac 应用程序菜单中的“隐藏其他”命令一样。 （长按在整个 VisionOS 中都很有用。）</p><p>您周围现实世界的直通视图意味着您可以在佩戴 Vision Pro 时站立并四处走动。它一点也不感觉不安全或迷失方向。事实上，这是异常自然的。但对于<em>使用</em>Vision Pro 来说，显然需要您保持静止，以固定的姿势坐着或站着。除了将 Vision Pro 用作相机之外，我想不出还有什么理由在走路时<em>使用</em>它。应用程序窗口相对于<em>您的</em>位置并不固定 - 它们相对于您周围的世界的位置是固定的。</p><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/">苹果的导览视频</a>比任何书面描述都更能传达使用该平台的基本要点。最重要的是：你看着东西，然后点击你的食指和拇指来“点击”或抓住你正在看的东西。听起来如此简单明了，但却是交互设计的突破。 Mac 为我们提供了“点击”功能。 iPhone 给了我们“点击和滑动”的功能。 Vision Pro 为我们提供了“查看并点击”的功能。这种交互模型的一个方面并不立即直观，那就是——除了一些明显的例外——你不会伸手去戳你直接看到的东西。即使在读完本文之后，您一开始也会想要这样做。但它对大多数事情都不起作用，而且即使有效也会很快变得令人厌烦。相反，您只需将手放在腿上或桌面上即可，只要它们处于最舒服的休息位置即可。</p><p> VisionOS 的虚拟键盘是值得注意的例外之一。 （键盘，复数，包括 QWERTY 打字键盘和用于输入设备密码的数字键盘，如果 Optic ID 由于某种原因失败。）VisionOS 虚拟键盘有<em>两种</em>工作方式 — 您可以注视要按下的每个键并点击您可以用手指和拇指依次激活它们，也可以伸出手戳虚拟按键。这两种方法都适合输入一个或两个单词（或 6 位密码）；这两种方法都不适合实际写作。 Siri 听写非常适合较长的文本输入，但如果您想在没有听写的情况下进行任何书写，则需要配对蓝牙键盘。虚拟键盘比在 Apple Watch 上打字要好，但也好不了多少。</p><p>使用蓝牙键盘的一个不可思议的方面是 VisionOS 在键盘上呈现虚拟 HUD。此 HUD 包含自动完成建议，并在一行中显示您正在键入的文本。对于那些不看键盘就无法打字的人来说，这是一种方便。在带有物理键盘的 Mac 或 iPad 上，您实际上只需移动眼睛即可从查看显示屏转向键盘。在 VisionOS 上，您需要移动头部，因为窗户往往离您更远，而且空间更高。这个小 HUD 可以让您在盯着物理键盘的同时看到您正在输入的内容。这很奇怪，但以一种好的方式。一周过去了，拥有一个带有可点击自动完成建议的物理键盘仍然让我脸上露出笑容。</p><p> VisionOS 还可以与 Magic Trackpad 或蓝牙鼠标配合使用。鼠标光标是一个圆形，就像 iPadOS 中的一样。您在窗口之间的空间中看不到光标；它只会出现在您正在查看的任何窗口内。</p><p> Mac 虚拟显示功能既实用又直观。如果您有 MacBook，只需打开 MacBook 盖子，VisionOS 就会在 MacBook 打开的显示屏上方显示一个弹出窗口，其中有两个按钮：“连接”和一个关闭按钮。点击“连接”按钮，您将获得一个与 Studio 显示屏大小相当的虚拟 Mac 显示屏。您可以像 VisionOS 中的任何其他窗口一样移动此窗口并调整其大小。虽然您无法增加它所代表的像素数量，但您可以将其放大到非常大。它非常有用，在连接时，您的 MacBook 键盘和触控板也可以在 VisionOS 应用程序中使用。您还可以使用 VisionOS 中的控制中心手动启动 Mac 虚拟显示模式（您可以通过点击视图顶部的一个小 V 形图标，向上看天花板或天空来访问该控制中心）。</p><p>上周我已经多次使用这种模式，唯一的问题是我不断发现自己想要使用 VisionOS 的“凝视和点击”与虚拟 Mac 显示屏内的元素进行交互。那是行不通的。因此，当我的手放在物理键盘和触控板上时，Mac（虚拟 Mac 显示屏内）和 VisionOS 应用程序上的一切都可以正常工作，但是当我的手离开物理触控板时，我用手指到拇指敲击在 VisionOS 应用程序窗口中，每次我将注意力转回虚拟 Mac 显示屏中的 Mac 应用程序时，我都会发现自己徒劳地用手指敲击来激活或单击我正在查看的任何内容。这类似于从 iPad 切换到 MacBook 并尝试触摸屏幕，但更糟糕的是，因为使用 VisionOS 中的虚拟 Mac 显示屏，您需要在 Mac 环境和 VisionOS 应用程序之间不断进行上下文切换。触控板在这两种情况下都能完美工作； “查看并点击”仅适用于 VisionOS（或仅用于移动、调整大小或激活虚拟 Mac 显示屏，而不是与其中的 Mac UI 交互）。</p><p> VisionOS 已经是 1.0.1 版本（当我设置它时，1.0.0 版本的软件更新已经可用），并且有一堆 1.0 错误。我不得不多次强制退出应用程序（包括“设置”）。 （同时按住顶部按钮和数字表冠按钮几秒钟，您会看到 MacOS 风格的“强制退出”对话框；继续按住这两个按钮，您可以强制重新启动系统。）</p><p>目前还没有很多原生 VisionOS 应用程序，但 iPad 应用程序确实运行良好。原生 VisionOS 应用程序和 iPad 应用程序之间的主要区别并不在于 VisionOS 应用程序运行得更好，而在于它们看起来更酷。在我看来，VisionOS 是自 iOS 1-6 中最初的拟物化 iPhone 界面以来苹果公司推出的最美观的操作系统。实际深度和阴影——真是个好主意。</p><p> VisionOS 主视图上的应用程序无法手动组织——即使在 1.0 版本中，这也是一个奇怪的遗漏。 （尤其是考虑到 Apple 吹嘘拥有无数兼容的 iPad 应用程序。）所有 iPad 应用程序（包括 Apple 本身的一堆内置应用程序，包括新闻、图书、日历和地图）都放在“兼容的应用程序”中。 Apps”文件夹，并有圆形图标。本机 VisionOS 应用程序位于应用程序视图的根级别，并具有圆形图标。</p><p> VisionOS 的基本交互模型感觉将被所有未来的 VR/AR 耳机复制，就像所有台式电脑都像 Mac 一样工作，而现在所有手机和平板电脑都像 iPhone 一样工作。当这种情况发生时，有些人会争辩说，当然他们都是这样工作的，因为否则他们怎么能工作呢？但在 Mac 出现之前，个人电脑并没有点击式 GUI，而在 iPhone 出现之前，手机也没有“这只是一个大触摸屏”的界面。目前还没有其他耳机具有“只需看着目标，然后点击手指和拇指”的界面。我怀疑几年后他们都会这么做。</p><h2>硬件，再次，A/V 版</h2><p>这让我回到 Vision Pro 的硬件。显示器非常出色，但我已经开始发现它们还不够好。眼动追踪非常好，但没有我希望的那么精确。这些相机很好，但它们无法达到您实际视力的动态范围。有时，您的视野周边会出现色边，具体取决于照明情况。您身边的光源（例如白天的窗户）会显示条纹。当你移动头部时，真正穿越的幻觉就被打破了——你可以看出你正在观看通过摄像机镜头展示世界的显示器。只需四处走动就足以打破现实世界自然穿越的错觉。事实上，在某些方面，沉浸式 3D 环境（山顶、湖畔、月球表面（！））在视觉上比实际的现实世界更加真实，因为平移视线时的延迟和剪切更少。</p><p>我使用过最初的 PlayStation 5 VR 耳机 HTC Vive Pro，并拥有一台 Meta Quest 3。Vision Pro 的显示质量使这些耳机看起来像是来自不同时代。 Vision Pro 处于不同的领域，玩着不同的游戏。在分辨率方面，Vision Pro 令人惊叹。我从来没有看到像素。我看到文字就像在现实生活中一样清晰。读起来很舒服。 （尽管很奇怪，但一周后，Safari 窗口看起来有 6 或 7 英尺高）。但我已经可以想象出<em>更好的</em>Vision 耳机显示屏。我已经可以想象摄像机镜头和我眼前的显示器之间的延迟会更低。我已经可以想象更大的动态范围，就像白天从昏暗的房间内向窗外看一样。</p><p> Vision Pro 的显示屏令人惊叹，但显然还不够好。</p><p>另一方面，扬声器简直令人惊叹。我从来没有经历过像他们这样的事情。我预计它们听起来不错，但不如 AirPods Pro 或 Max。相反，我发现它们听起来比我戴过的任何耳机都要好得多。这是因为它们实际上是扬声器，最佳位置位于您的耳朵前面。总有一个问题，Vision Pro 扬声器的问题是它们根本不是私人的。坐在您旁边的人可以听到您所听到的声音；您附近的人可以听到您听到的大部分内容。在公共场所或靠近其他人的地方使用 Vision Pro 时，出于隐私和礼貌的考虑，您需要佩戴 AirPods，而不是出于音频质量的考虑。</p><p>扬声器还传达出一种不可思议的空间现实感。</p><p>最后，我在使用 Vision Pro 充满电的情况下始终获得了 3 个小时的电池续航时间。有时多一点。根据我的经验，Apple 声称的 2-2.5 小时电池续航时间只是一个下限，而不是上限。在长时间的训练中我也没有感到身体不适或恶心。 <sup id="fnr3-2024-01-30"><a href="#fn3-2024-01-30">3</a></sup></p><h2>我很想，但应该抵制，在本节标题中制作“不受欢迎的人”双关语</h2><p><em>人物角色</em>是 Vision Pro 的一大亮点。您的角色是您头部和肩膀的数字化身，在进行 FaceTime 通话或使用其他采用 API 的视频通话软件时，它会代替您出现。发布时已包括 Zoom、Webex 和 Microsoft Teams。</p><p>苹果公司将整个角色功能显着地标记为“测试版”，只要一看就知道为什么。人物角色很奇怪。他们处于<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">恐怖谷</a>的深处。不会将角色与真实的人混淆。有时，他们看起来更像是电子游戏中的角色，而不是逼真的面容。在任何时候，他们看起来<em>都有点</em>像电子游戏角色。例如，我的头发看起来就像闪亮的塑料乐高假发。</p><p>即使捕捉到你的角色也很尴尬。您必须将 Vision Pro 从头上取下并转动它，以便摄像头（和激光雷达传感器？）可以看到您，但您无法获得摄像头所捕获内容的良好图像，因为前置 EyeSight 显示屏是分辨率相对较低。头带可能会弄乱头发，您需要在实际的镜子里检查自己，以确保衬衫光滑。</p><p>我的妻子捕捉了我的妻子，她的反应 - 根本不知道会发生什么 - “不，不，不 - 哦，天哪，这是什么？”然后她才开始笑。我们和她告诉我：“再也不要再这样给我打电话。”她在开玩笑（我想），但是角色在奇怪的山谷中如此深入，以至于第一次看到一个人，他们将想谈论它。</p><p>苹果在此功能方面处于艰难的位置。该功能显然值得在其当前状态下具有突出的“ beta”标签。但是，您还可以看到为什么Apple需要在启动时包含该功能，无论它距离“好”有多远。您今天无法运送无法用于视频会议的生产力计算机。就像电子邮件或网络浏览：必不可少的。但这只留下了两个选择：类似卡通的备忘录，或者尝试了摄影主义。为此，苹果几乎可以肯定可以将一个备忘录击出公园，但我认为正确地认为，在大多数专业工作环境中，这是完全不合适的。您可以作为备忘录的家人和朋友面对面，他们会在没有判断的情况下接受它，而不是专业的同事或客户。</p><p>为了捍卫他们现在存在的角色，我发现我确实习惯了几分钟的电话。 （我有一个30分钟的FaceTime电话，与Apple的Vision-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Proware代表，以及与其他评论家Joanna Stern和Nilay Patel的电话。）但是我认为他们效果最好假设，在两个（或更多）的人之间都在使用Vision Pro。对于大多数电话而言，这显然不会是这种情况。随着越来越多的人购买和使用视觉耳机，并且随着苹果的竞赛来改善非β质量的功能，这将变得归一化。但是目前，如果您使用它，请期望谈论它。</p><p>您的角色也用于在视力功能中呈现您的眼睛。在苹果产品营销中，视力是Vision Pro的标题功能。它在他们的网站及其广告上出名。但是实际上，这非常微妙。这是我能够捕捉自己表现出视力的最好的自拍照：</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/eyesight-in-action.jpeg" class="noborder"><img

<p>苹果昨天宣布了一项广泛，广泛且复杂的新政策，以建立他们遵守《欧盟的数字市场法》的预期遵守，该法案将于3月7日生效。还有很多值得注意的问题，还有许多剩下的问题，但我最喜欢Take来自塞巴斯蒂亚（Sebastiaan de）在Twitter/X上，这是宣布其中任何一个的<em>前一天</em>。</p><p>在<a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1750288120904655154">将</a>“ Spotify也想推出替代应用商店”的屏幕截图打开“哦，上帝<a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1750291816602300812">拜托”之后，与此对话</a>：</p><p>与：</p><blockquote><p>欧盟再次解决了绝对没有问题，并使技术中的一切变得更糟。我要说，他们是一致的。</p></blockquote><p> “安东”：</p><blockquote><p>过于强大，寻求租金的看门人似乎是一个问题。</p></blockquote><p>与：</p><blockquote><p>我喜欢我不能说您在这种情况下是在谈论欧盟还是苹果。</p></blockquote><p>从同一线程中，我的第二个最喜欢的<a href="https://twitter.com/maxrovensky/status/1750600510346817950">是来自Max Rovensky</a> ：</p><blockquote><p> DMA不是亲消费者。</p><p>这是反物业。</p><p>这些倾向于有时会重合的，这使得对公众很容易出售，但实际上确实阅读了DMA，这很有趣。</p></blockquote><p>我会稍微走得更远，并将DMA描述为反<em>美国</em>的企业，因为据我所知，DMA中没有任何不利影响甚至惹恼任何欧洲科技公司。实际上，它的某些方面似乎是专门<em>为</em>Spotify写的。</p><p>但是罗文斯基的框架捕获了二分法。抗高企业的调节和亲消费者的结果通常确实与之携带，但DMA暴露了裂缝。我认为DMA不会改变太大（如果有的话），因为欧盟的iOS用户（或欧盟中的非OIS用户）都不会<a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">改变</a>。 ，我认为，如果它具有任何实际效果，那将使用户变得<em>更糟</em>。这些选项是否对开发人员更好，似乎不太清楚。</p><p>我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">经常说</a>，苹果的优先事项是一致的：苹果自己的需求首先，用户第二，开发人员第三。欧盟委员会的优先事项使开发人员首先，用户第二，而“看门人”排名第三。 DMA规定的不是双赢的框架，而是双赢的框架。</p><p>苹果（Apple）感到自豪，固执，傲慢，控制并确信它具有客户的最大利益。</p><p>欧盟委员会为其公民的最大利益而感到自豪，固执，傲慢，控制并确信。</p><p>自从DMA发生这种碰撞似乎是不可避免的，从大约两年前开始，我一直在试图想象它的结果。每次，我首先问：哪一侧更聪明？我的钱一直在苹果上。我认为，昨天的公告显示了原因。</p><h2>苹果提议的更改</h2><p>总结苹果昨天宣布的所有内容真的很难，但是我会尝试的。从Apple新闻编辑室的主要新闻稿开始，“ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">Apple宣布对iOS，Safari和欧盟的App Store进行更改</a>”：</p><blockquote><p> “我们今天宣布的变化符合《数字市场法案》在欧盟中的要求，同时帮助保护欧盟用户免受该法规带来的不可避免的隐私和安全威胁的不可避免的。我们的首要任务仍然为欧盟和世界各地的用户创造最好，最安全的体验。 “开发人员现在可以了解可用于替代应用程序分销和替代付款处理的新工具和条款，替代浏览器引擎的新功能以及无接触式付款等等。重要的是，如果愿意，开发人员可以选择在今天的业务条款上保持相同的业务条款。”</p></blockquote><p>席勒（Schiller）是新闻稿中唯一引用的苹果高管，在我看来，他的写作之手在整个公告中遍布。在将DMA放入法律之前，苹果很清楚<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/11/federighi_sideloading_keynote_at_web_summit">，他们认为对iOS上的强制性局限性对用户来说是一个坏主意</a>，而昨天他们的公告并没有宣布仍然是一个坏主意。</p><p>苹果公司还始终认为，他们寻求为iOS平台的第三方开发而获利，并且被迫从他们当前的系统中进行更改 - （a）所有应用都必须来自App Store； （b）开发人员永远不会为免费应用程序的分发支付任何费用； （c）付费的应用程序和用于数字内容的应用程序内应用程序内应用程序内必须通过苹果的应用内付款系统，该系统可以使苹果的30/15％佣金自动化 - 这将使它们如何使平台获利。现在，苹果已经揭示了欧盟中iPhone应用程序的一系列复杂的规则和政策。</p><p> MG Siegler非常有趣，很有趣 -<a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-to-eu-drop-dead/">剖析了苹果的新闻稿逐线</a>。西格勒得出结论：</p><blockquote><p>老实说，我不确定我是否会记得如此不屑一顾的新闻稿。苹果甚至可能在上面的许多观点中都有一点，但是它的框架似乎可以确保苹果将继续与欧盟在所有这一切中继续战斗，现在无疑是更多。通常，如果您要进行一些更改并考虑关闭此事，则在强调空气中将中指推送出来时不会这样做。</p><p>这些更改中的一些似乎确实很好且有用，但是大多数情况<a href="https://www.threads.net/@mgsiegler/post/C2iRgI8LH-H?ref=spyglass.org">似乎是</a>令人费解的更改，以确保现状实际上不会发生太大变化，如果有的话。请记住，“重要的是，如果他们愿意，开发人员可以选择在今天的业务方面保持相同的业务条款。”您认为苹果喜欢什么？</p></blockquote><p>苹果试图解决的难题是创建一个新政策的框架 - 超过600个新的开发人员API来启用这些政策 - 遵守DMA，同时保持阻力最小的路径和开发人员的风险：Apple自己的App Store app App Store就这样。</p><p>因此，开发人员的第一个选择是什么都不做 - 仅在现有条款下独家留在Apple的App Store中。 （苹果昨天昨天发布了一些公告，这些公告在全球范围内，不仅在欧盟中，<a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f1v8pyay">例如有关流式游戏服务规则，迷你游戏和迷你应用的更改</a>。为了简洁<em>起见</em>， &#39;专注于与DMA依从性相关的欧盟特定变化。）</p><p>一个混乱的一点是，苹果提议的DMA合规性的某些方面适用于所有平台（iPhone，iPad，Mac，TV，Watch，Watch和of Five），但其他方面是iOS平台的特定方面 -

Many proponents of the DMA have been under the conviction that the DMA mandates gatekeeper platforms like iOS to permit direct downloads of apps from the web (like on PCs and Macs). Here&#39;s Article 6, Section 4 of the DMA, boldface all-caps emphasis added:</p><blockquote><p> 4. The gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of third-party software applications <b>OR</b> software application stores using, or interoperating with, its operating system and allow those software applications <b>OR</b> software application stores to be accessed by means other than the relevant core platform services of that gatekeeper. The gatekeeper shall, where applicable, not prevent the downloaded third-party software applications <b>OR</b> software application stores from prompting end users to decide whether they want to set that downloaded software application <b>OR</b> software application store as their default. The gatekeeper shall technically enable end users who decide to set that downloaded software application <b>OR</b> software application store as their default to carry out that change easily.</p></blockquote><p> By Apple&#39;s interpretation, all of those <em>or</em> ’s would be <em>and/or</em> ’s or <em>and</em> ’s if the DMA demanded that iOS support both third-party marketplaces <em>and</em> direct installation of individual apps and games. See below regarding the uncertainty of this interpretation.</p><h2> Apple Will Still Review All Apps, But With Very Different Rules</h2><p> All apps for iOS require an Apple Developer Program account. <sup id="fnr5-2024-01-26"><a href="#fn5-2024-01-26">5</a></sup> All apps and every update must still be submitted to Apple for notarization. After review, Apple will then forward apps to each marketplace where the app is distributed. The review policies for apps distributed via marketplace apps are entirely different from the App Store. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#faq">From Apple&#39;s FAQ</a> , again:</p><blockquote><p> Developers can submit a single binary and will be able to choose alternative distribution options in App Store Connect. Notarization for iOS apps will check for:</p><ul><li> Accuracy — Apps must accurately represent the developer, capabilities, and costs to users.</li><li> Functionality — Binaries must be reviewable, free of serious bugs or crashes, and compatible with the current version of iOS. They cannot manipulate software or hardware in ways that negatively impact the user experience.</li><li> Safety — Apps cannot promote physical harm of the user or public.</li><li> Security — Apps cannot enable distribution of malware or of suspicious or unwanted software. They cannot download executable code, read outside of the container, or direct users to lower the security on their system or device. Also, apps must provide transparency and allow user consent to enable any party to access the system or device, or reconfigure the system or other software.</li><li> Privacy — Apps cannot collect or transmit private, sensitive data without a user&#39;s knowledge or in a manner contrary to the stated purpose of the software.</li></ul></blockquote><p> Apple representatives I&#39;ve been in briefings with — multiple times over the last two days — emphasized that <em>content</em> restrictions that apply to apps distributed in the App Store will not apply to those distributed exclusively in EU marketplaces. Adult content and pornography were cited as examples: porn apps will never be permitted in the App Store, but will not be rejected by Apple for distribution in marketplaces. That will be up to each individual marketplace.</p><p> Apple&#39;s review process will continue to involve both automated checks and human review. Private API usage will <em>not</em> be permitted. This restriction, Apple believes, is kosher under the DMA under another provision of Article 6, Section 4, which states:</p><blockquote><p> The gatekeeper shall not be prevented from taking, to the extent that they are strictly necessary and proportionate, measures to ensure that third-party software applications or software application stores do not endanger the integrity of the hardware or operating system provided by the gatekeeper, provided that such measures are duly justified by the gatekeeper.</p></blockquote><p> So any third-party app that is prevented from appearing in the App Store because it uses private APIs or <a href="https://blog.eidinger.info/system-programming-interfaces-spi-in-swift-explained">SPIs</a> will thus also be prevented from appearing in third-party marketplaces. Apps that attempt to circumvent sandbox restrictions, background processing restrictions, etc. will be considered by Apple to “endanger the integrity of the hardware or operating system”.</p><p> One oddity is that the DMA&#39;s prohibition against content-based restrictions by gatekeepers is that Apple will not be permitted to reject apps or games for piracy or copyright violations. If a rando no-name developer submits for distribution on a third-party marketplace a game that features Buzz Lightyear, Donald Duck, Mario, and Donkey Kong going on a murderous <em>Grand-Theft-Auto</em> -style blood-soaked (among other bodily fluids) rampage, Apple will not be permitted to reject it on copyright violation grounds. They may not be permitted to reject an app titled “Tim Cook Is a Jerk” or “Apple Keynote” either. The DMA is clear that gatekeepers can only reject or block apps for technical reasons, not content reasons, no matter if the content is glaringly illegal. Under the DMA, it&#39;s up to government entities and individual marketplaces to gate apps by content.</p><h2> The CTF Upends Expectations and Seems to Be Apple&#39;s Defense Against Having Control Over iOS Wrested Away</h2><p> One of Apple&#39;s strategic concerns about the DMA is protecting the large (and still-growing) revenue it garners from third-party iOS apps. (Duh.) Another is protecting its customers&#39; privacy, safety, and user experience.</p><p> But Apple&#39;s overriding concern is surely <em>control</em> . Control encompasses all of Apple&#39;s concerns, from their own revenue to users&#39; experiences. Any form of compliance with the DMA necessarily implies Apple losing some control over the iOS platform. (Any users who switch from Safari, or any other WebKit-based browser, to a browser using Google Chrome&#39;s Blink or Mozilla&#39;s Firefox/Gecko rendering engines are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/31/safari-chrome-battery-life">almost</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/05/safari_vs_chrome_on_the_mac#fn2-2017-05-24">certainly</a> going to see an adverse hit to battery life. But Apple must allow third-party web rendering engines on the iPhone in the EU, including through the App Store. <sup id="fnr6-2024-01-26"><a href="#fn6-2024-01-26">6</a></sup> )</p><p> The CTF, I think, is Apple&#39;s way of minimizing the risk of competing marketplace stores from their biggest rivals: Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (probably in that order). The EC is obsessed with payment processing and Apple&#39;s commissions from IAP. Apple&#39;s stance, from the inception of the App Store in 2008 through today, has been that they monetize the iOS platform solely through purchase commissions of paid apps, and because that&#39;s the only way they monetize the platform, that&#39;s one of the reasons the use of their own App Store payment system has been mandatory. (Apple also argues, with numerous meritable points, that there are user benefits to mandating the use of App Store payments. My favorite example are their subscription policies, including mandatory renewal notices and easy cancellation.) You can agree or disagree that this is a good policy, including the base assumption that Apple should seek to “monetize” the iOS platform in any way at all different from how they monetize MacOS <sup id="fnr7-2024-01-26"><a href="#fn7-2024-01-26">7</a></sup> — but that&#39;s Apple&#39;s stance.</p><p> The DMA is a direct attack on Apple&#39;s entire monetization strategy. It mandates that alternate payment processing be available to apps in the EU, even from Apple&#39;s own App Store, mandates permitting links to the web for payment, and mandates allowing apps to be distributed from outside the App Store. <em>Attack</em> is a strong word, but huge portions of the DMA are clearly targeting one platform: the iPhone/iOS.</p><p> The EC&#39;s obsession with payment processing and commissions blinded them, I think, to the fact that Apple has always had other options for monetization. This Core Technology Fee, based on installations rather than purchases, is one of them.</p><p> The CTF disrupts the free/freemium model used by Apple&#39;s biggest rivals and competitors. Meta&#39;s apps are all free: WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and now Threads. Meta has paid Apple effectively nothing for those apps, ever. The YouTube app offers IAP subscriptions but most of Google&#39;s popular iOS apps are just completely free, so Google pays Apple nothing. Spotify has 500 million worldwide users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/spotify-now-has-more-than-500m-users/">split 40-60 between paid and free</a> (ad-supported). That means Spotify likely has roughly 100 million free users on iOS — and Spotify pays Apple nothing.</p><p> If any of these companies, with hundreds of millions of EU users, opts in to the new EU rules (and thus opts out of the existing App Store rules), they&#39;ll be on the hook to pay Apple hundreds of millions of dollars (well, euros — but they&#39;re roughly 1:1) per year.</p><p> My first thought upon doing this back-of-the-envelope math was that the CTF was a poison pill. Of course none of these companies that pay Apple nothing to distribute their apps through the App Store would opt in to a new system that would require them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars per year, per app.正确的？ But then I realized that these companies operate at such enormous financial scale that “hundreds of millions of dollars” isn&#39;t ridiculous to them.</p><p> Consider simply that Google pays Apple $20-fucking-BILLION dollars per year to keep Google Search as the default search engine in Safari. They may well consider paying Apple a mere $1 billion per year acceptable to run their own iOS marketplace in the EU. Likewise for Meta and Microsoft, which like Google are fabulously profitable. Probably not, however, for Spotify, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-grew-far-more-than-expected-but-is-still-losing-money-121553523.html">which has never been consistently profitable</a> . Not surprisingly, while Meta, Microsoft, and Google have refrained from comment, <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">Spotify is shocked</a> — shocked — at Apple&#39;s proposed compliance with the DMA, describing it as “extortion” and “a complete and total farce”. (And MG Siegler thought <em>Apple’s</em> press release dripped with disdain.)</p><p> The DMA says Apple can&#39;t make the App Store the exclusive distribution source for iOS apps in the EU, and can&#39;t make its own payment system exclusive for apps from the App Store, either. But I don&#39;t see anything in the DMA that says Apple is prevented from charging fees to developers.</p><p> The assumption from many App Store critics has been something like this: <em>We don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s current iOS App Store policies. The DMA demands Apple change those policies in the EU. Therefore Apple will surely change its policies in the EU to something we like, and that Apple loathes.</em> (And Mozilla, to name another outspoken critic of Apple&#39;s restrictions and policies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox">further assumed that Apple would change its worldwide policies on browser engines</a> to match the EU&#39;s requirements in the DMA. They&#39;re smoking the good stuff.)</p><p> That the DMA declares Apple&#39;s existing terms no longer acceptable does not mean Apple&#39;s only compliant response would be to cede most control over iOS. What Apple has proposed this week, across the board, indicates a desire to keep iOS (and the App Store across all platforms) as much in line with Apple&#39;s desires as possible within the letter of the DMA. Anyone who thought Apple would propose different has not been paying attention <em>at all</em> .</p><h2> These Are Merely Proposals</h2><p> I&#39;ve emphasized throughout this piece the word <em>proposals</em> . That&#39;s key, because no one, including Apple, knows whether the European Commission is going to find any or all of them compliant with the DMA. Apple has met with EC representatives dozens of times across several years regarding the DMA, but the way the EC works is that (1) they pass laws; (2) companies do all the work to attempt compliance with those laws; and only then (3) does the EC decide whether they comply. Companies like Apple don&#39;t get to run ideas past the EC and get a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. They have to build them, then find out.</p><p> Which brings me back to my lede, and Sebastiaan de With&#39;s quip that he couldn&#39;t tell if a gripe about “overly powerful, rent-seeking gatekeepers” was about Apple, or about the EU.</p><p> The delicious irony in Apple&#39;s not knowing if these massive, complicated proposals will be deemed DMA-compliant is that their dealings with the European Commission sound exactly like App Store developers&#39; dealings with Apple. Do all the work to build it first, and only <em>then</em> find out if it passes muster with largely inscrutable rules interpreted by faceless bureaucrats.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2024-01-26"><p> “App marketplace” is Apple&#39;s term for a third-party app store. I&#39;m adopting it, because (a) it&#39;s fair, plain, non-pejorative language; and (b) it deftly gets around any confusion between Apple&#39;s first-party title-cased “App Store” and third-party generic “app stores”. For example, presumably because Apple holds a trademark for “App Store”, Amazon&#39;s store for Android and Windows 11 apps (which has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/22/8-steps">existed since 2011</a> , with little fanfare, and, I think, very few users) is named <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get-appstore/android">Amazon Appstore</a> . <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R1925#d1e2591-1-1">The text of the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act</a> describes such stores, a bit formally, as “software application stores”. <a href="#fnr1-2024-01-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2024-01-26"><p> In 2022, iOS 16 dropped support for the <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-touch-7th-gen-a2178-2019-specs.html">7th (and final) generation iPod Touch</a> , which was released in 2019.

I suspect, however, that they created the iPadOS name only to reflect the growing disparity in features between the two platforms — things like side-by-side multitasking and now Stage Manager. (Also the fact that many new features destined, ultimately, for both platforms come to the iPhone a year ahead of the iPad, like Home screen widgets and lockscreen customization.)

Web developer proponents of “Progressive Web Apps” (PWAs) have been clamoring for third-party rendering engines on iOS so they can build web apps that use features WebKit on iOS doesn&#39;t support. They&#39;ll need to bundle their PWAs with the embedded third-party rendering engines, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/12/electron_and_the_decline_of_native_apps">Electron-style</a> , and distribute them through EU marketplace apps, just like big-boy native apps written in Swift and Objective-C, if they want to use features unsupported by WebKit. (Or be satisfied running only in a tab inside a browser app that includes a non-WebKit engine.)</p><p> The fact that iOS browsers using third-party rendering engines will not be able to save PWAs as standalone apps on the Home screen does not appear to be written in any of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/browserenginekit">Apple&#39;s documentation regarding BrowserEngineKit</a> , but it doesn&#39;t need to be. There simply are no APIs to enable it, nor any clause in the DMA that requires it. I checked with a well-informed little birdie who confirmed that this will not be possible. As with almost every aspect of Apple&#39;s DMA compliance proposals, those who anticipated a PC/Mac-style anything-goes install-whatever-software-you-want free-for-all are — if Apple&#39;s interpretation of the DMA is largely correct — going非常失望。 <a href="#fnr6-2024-01-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn7-2024-01-26"><p> Through 2009 — two years after the launch of the iPhone, one year after the launch of the iOS App Store — Apple sold Mac OS X version upgrades for $129. Meaning each time you upgraded from, say, 10.2 to 10.3, then again from 10.3 to 10.4, you had to pay $129. Mac fans would wait in line outside Apple Stores to buy these upgrades on launch day. From 2009&#39;s Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard through 2013&#39;s Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks, they sold version upgrades for $29 and then $19. As hard as it is for many longtime developers to accept that Apple charges a mandatory sales commission (or, now in the EU, a Core Technology Fee per-installation) for all third-party iOS apps, it would be even harder to make today&#39;s iPhone users accept paying $129/year for version updates to iOS. In a sense, starting with the iPhone, Apple has shifted from monetizing its OSes by charging users a licensing fee to charging developers a privilege fee. <a href="#fnr7-2024-01-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple&#39;s Plans for the DMA in the European Union</title></entry><entry><title> Jury Orders Trump to Pay E.

<p>纽约时报：</p><blockquote><p> On Friday, Roberta A.

<p>Steven Levy has a great piece at Wired commemorating the Mac&#39;s 40th anniversary, including interviews with a slew of Apple executives:</p><blockquote><p> For the past few years, the form factors of Macintoshes have been fairly stable. Could a Mac in the future look totally different, as when the iMac morphed from a basketball to a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/563365/imac-g4-design-memory-ergonomics.html">lamp</a> ?</p><p> “There&#39;s definitely the possibility for a revolution in the future,” says Molly Anderson, a leader in industrial design at Apple. “When we start a new project, we don&#39;t start by thinking of the constraints of how popular our existing products are. We&#39;re always focused on trying to design the best tool for the job.” Joswiak adds that it has taken courage to keep changing the Mac to keep it on the forefront — always, of course, in a deliberate fashion. “The road to tech hell is paved by people who do things because they can, not because they should,” he says.</p></blockquote><p> Jony Ive told me once that one of Apple&#39;s guiding principles was never to make changes for the sake of change alone. If an idea doesn&#39;t make the product better, they don&#39;t do it. If that means some products only change radically in form factor once or twice a decade, so be it. Good design should stand the test of time.</p><p> Levy also includes an excerpt from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/the-birth-of-the-mac-rolling-stones-1984-feature-on-steve-jobs-and-his-whiz-kids-243516/">a piece he wrote for Rolling Stone on the original launch</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If you have had any prior experience with personal computers, what you might expect to see is some sort of opaque code, called a “prompt,” consisting of phosphorescent green or white letters on a murky background. What you see with Macintosh is the Finder. On a pleasant, light background, little pictures called “icons” appear, representing choices available to you. A word-processing program might be represented by a pen, while the program that lets you draw pictures might have a paintbrush icon. A file would represent stored documents — book reports, letters, legal briefs and so forth. To see a particular file, you&#39;d move the mouse, which would, in turn, move the cursor to the file you wanted. You&#39;d tap a button on the mouse twice, and the contents of the file would appear on the screen: dark on light, just like a piece of paper.</p><p> This seems simple, but most personal computers (including the IBM PC) can&#39;t do this.</p><p> “When you show Mac to an absolute novice,” says Chris Espinosa, the twenty-two-year-old head of publications for the Mac team, “he assumes that&#39;s the way all computers work. That&#39;s our highest achievement. We&#39;ve made almost every computer that&#39;s ever been made look completely absurd.”</p></blockquote><p> Espinosa might be the only person at Apple <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/22/espinosa-45">who can say</a> “40th anniversary?没什么。”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Steven Levy: ‘Apple Shares the Secret of Why the 40-Year-Old Mac Still Rules’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/levy-mac-still-rules">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Show Me More Macs&#39;: Every Macintosh Ever Made </title><link href="https://mac40th.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/va8" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/zufi-more-macs" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40544</id><published> 2024-01-25T01:46:42Z</published><updated> 2024-01-25T01:46:43Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Harry McCracken, writing at Fast Company:</p><blockquote><p> The most celebrated part of that original Mac was its software interface, which brimmed with new ideas, despite the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/01/15/steve-jobs-steals-from-xerox-to-battle-big-brother-ibm/?sh=6b939dc012e0">lazy conventional wisdom</a> that it merely imitated <a href="https://zurb.com/blog/steve-jobs-and-xerox-the-truth-about-inno">work done at Xerox&#39;s PARC lab</a> . But at the moment, I&#39;m most fascinated by its industrial design. That petite all-in-one beige case, created by Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama, was unlike anything anyone had seen until then — at least outside of a kitchen. [...]</p><p> But if all the first Mac inspires is nostalgia, we&#39;ve lost sight of how daring it was. Unlike Apple&#39;s first blockbuster PC, the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90614203/watch-a-tv-news-report-on-the-wacky-apple-ii-knockoffs-of-the-1980s">Apple II</a> , it had a built-in display but no integrated keyboard. It also sacrificed most of the Apple II&#39;s defining features, such as its dazzling color graphics and expansion slots.</p><p> In retrospect, it&#39;s among the gutsiest gambits Apple ever made. Imagine the company introducing a new smartphone that has virtually nothing in common with the iPhone. You can&#39;t — or at least it strains my imagination.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s what kept me from <em>getting</em> the Mac until I owned one. The Apple II defined what I thought of as a computer, and because the Mac didn&#39;t resemble the Apple II in <em>any way</em> — it didn&#39;t even have a compatibility mode to run Apple II software — it seemed like something else to me. An appliance of some sort, not a <em>computer</em> .</p><p> Turns out it was the best concept for a computer anyone has ever devised.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Harry McCracken on the Original Macintosh’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/mccracken-original-macintosh">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jason Snell: &#39;The Mac Turns 40&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/24048479/apple-mac-40-anniversary" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/va6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/snell-mac-40" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40542</id><published> 2024-01-25T01:32:31Z</published><updated> 2024-01-25T01:32:31Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Twenty years ago, on the Mac&#39;s 20th anniversary, I <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/169580/themacturns20jobs.html">asked Steve Jobs</a> if the Mac would still be relevant to Apple in the age of the iPod. He scoffed at the prospect of the Mac not being important: “of course” it would be.</p><p> Yet, 10 years later, Apple&#39;s revenue was increasingly dominated by the iPhone, and the recent success of the new iPad had provided another banner product for the company. When I interviewed Apple exec Phil Schiller for the Mac&#39;s 30th anniversary, I found myself asking him about the Mac&#39;s relevance, too. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/222761/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html">He also scoffed</a> : “Our view is, the Mac keeps going forever,” he said.</p><p> Today marks 40 years since Jobs unveiled the original Macintosh at an event in Cupertino, and it once again feels right to ask what&#39;s next for the Mac.</p></blockquote><p> The subhead on Snell&#39;s piece at The Verge nails it:</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s longest-running product is an increasingly small part of the company&#39;s business. And yet, it&#39;s never been more successful.</p></blockquote><p> Over at Six Colors, Snell has more from <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/01/mac-40-a-quick-qa-with-greg-joswiak/">an interview with Greg Joswiak</a> , and, separately, a deep dive <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/01/mac-at-40-the-eras-tour/">looking back at the major eras of the Mac&#39;s history</a> , dividing them by processor architecture. From that piece:</p><blockquote><p> The IBM PC and the emerging DOS PC clone standard weren&#39;t the only enemies here. Plenty of other platforms existed in the early days, including the one that generated most of Apple&#39;s revenue, the Apple II.</p><p> History tends to flatten everything into simple narratives, so you might expect that the moment the Mac was introduced, Apple began pivoting away from the Apple II.但那并<em>没有</em>发生。 Apple didn&#39;t discontinue the last Apple II model until nearly a decade into the Mac&#39;s existence. After the Mac was introduced, Apple kept introducing new Apple II models: The compact IIc three months later and the 16-bit IIGS more than two years later.</p></blockquote><p> The Mac was a curiosity for me, growing up in the 1980s — intriguing, but it was the Apple II platform that had my attention (and heart) at the time. Then, when I finally got my first Mac in 1991 (a Macintosh LC with 4 MB of RAM and a 40 MB hard disk), I <em>got it</em> . It was like turning on a light in a dark room.我终于明白了。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell: ‘The Mac Turns 40’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/snell-mac-40">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jon Stewart Is Returning to &#39;The Daily Show&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/jon-stewart-returns-daily-show-rcna135483" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/va5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/jon-stewart-returns" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40541</id><published> 2024-01-24T23:22:48Z</published><updated> 2024-01-24T23:22:49Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Spotify：</p><blockquote><p> For years, even in our own app, Apple had these rules where we couldn&#39;t tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it. We know, pretty nuts. The DMA means that we&#39;ll <em>finally</em> be able to share details about deals, promotions, and better-value payment options in the EU. And an easier experience for you means good things for artists, authors, and creators looking to build their audiences of listeners, concert-goers, and audiobook-loving fans.更重要的是？ All of this can now come without the burden of a mandatory ~30% tax imposed by Apple, which is prohibited under the DMA.</p></blockquote><p> Spotify&#39;s assumptions about how sideloading is going to work on iOS are clearly at odds with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/wsj-apple-sideloading">the description of Apple&#39;s plans</a> from The Wall Street Journal today. The Journal did not state what percentage commission or fees Apple plans to collect, but it sounds like Spotify thinks they&#39;re going to offer an iOS app through which they won&#39;t pay Apple anything at all for in-app transactions. Their blog post has a series of before-and-after screenshots, and the “after” screenshots show a purchasing flow that doesn&#39;t involve any of the warnings or scaresheets Apple has required for the “reader” app entitlement, Dutch dating apps, or the new External Purchase Links entitlement.</p><p> Spotify even plans to run their own app store, with multiple apps. (It seems unclear if the Spotify app store for iOS would host games and apps from other developers, or only a suite of apps from Spotify itself.)</p><p> Spotify more or less assumes they&#39;ll be free from all Apple restrictions and commissions, and feels free to lambast Apple&#39;s policies as “pretty nuts” and “ridiculous”:</p><blockquote><p> It should be this easy for every single Spotify customer <em>everywhere</em> . But if you live outside certain markets, you will continue to encounter frustrating roadblocks because of Apple&#39;s ridiculous rules.</p></blockquote><p> We don&#39;t know Apple&#39;s plans yet, but will soon. But it sure sounds like Apple and Spotify have <em>completely</em> different and utterly incompatible interpretations of what the DMA requires. Seems like one side or the other is in for a big surprise.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Spotify Reveals Its Plans for the Post-DMA Era of Sideloading in the E.U.’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/spotify-dma-plans">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Wall Street Journal on Apple&#39;s Plans for iOS Sideloading in the EU </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-plans-new-fees-and-restrictions-for-downloads-outside-app-store-f464f426?mod=hp_lista_pos1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/va3" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/wsj-apple-sideloading" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40539</id><published> 2024-01-24T22:51:28Z</published><updated> 2024-01-26T17:03:55Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Aaron Tilley, Salvador Rodriguez, Sam Schechner, and Kim Mackrael, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AoSzTgHGXSpKQnmjAQTcSig">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Meta Platforms, Spotify and other companies are preparing new download options for customers in anticipation of the new rules. Meta is considering a system that would allow people to download apps directly from Facebook ads. Spotify plans to offer users the ability to download some of its iPhone apps directly from its website, according to the company. Microsoft has weighed a launch of its own third-party app store for games in the past. [...]</p><p> Apple&#39;s approach to the EU law will help ensure the company maintains close oversight of apps downloaded outside the App Store, a process known as sideloading. The company will give itself the ability to review each app downloaded outside of its App Store. Apple also plans to collect fees from developers that offer downloads outside of the App Store, said people familiar with the company&#39;s plans. The company hasn&#39;t yet announced its plans and they could change.</p><p> The restrictions and fees could renew tensions with app developers, some of whom had expected the new law to allow them to deliver their apps to users free of Apple&#39;s restrictions or what they see as a high commission. The new European law “is a regulation with teeth, with the possibility to apply fines and with a possibility for the commission to have powers of investigation,” said Olivia Regnier, a senior director of European policy at Spotify.</p></blockquote><p> The Journal story is light on details, but it sounds like Apple is planning for a system largely like last week&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement">External Purchase Link entitlement</a> , where developers will still be on the hook to pay Apple 27/12 percent commissions. How will this review process work for apps that aren&#39;t distributed through the App Store?</p><p> I&#39;ve considered it very odd from the start that the DMA is not clear at all about this. And here we are on the cusp of it going into effect, and we still seemingly have no idea whether the European Commission and Apple see eye to eye on what the DMA demands for compliance.</p><p> Clearly, the most strident critics of Apple&#39;s App Store policies believe that the DMA requires opening iOS to something akin to how the Mac works: where the App Store is one method of software distribution, but users are free to simply download apps directly from developers&#39; websites, so long as those apps are signed. According to the Journal, Apple is planning to announce something not like that at all.</p><p> I have a feeling that fireworks are going to fly when Apple announces their compliance plans, but I don&#39;t know. Maybe Apple has shared their plans in detail with the EC and the EC is fine with it. But if that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t see how the DMA “has teeth” when it comes to sideloading.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Wall Street Journal on Apple’s Plans for iOS Sideloading in the E.U.’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/wsj-apple-sideloading">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Signal Will Cost $50 Million Per Year to Run </title><link href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/va2" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/signal-50m" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40538</id><published> 2024-01-24T22:50:27Z</published><updated> 2024-01-24T22:50:27Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Meredith Whittaker and Joshua Lund, writing for the Signal blog back in November:</p><blockquote><p> Instead of monetizing surveillance, we&#39;re supported by donations, including a generous initial loan from Brian Acton. Our goal is to move as close as possible to becoming fully supported by small donors, relying on a large number of modest contributions from people who care about Signal. We believe this is the safest form of funding in terms of sustainability: ensuring that we remain accountable to the people who use Signal, avoiding any single point of funding failure, and rejecting the widespread practice of monetizing surveillance.</p><p> But our nonprofit structure doesn&#39;t mean it costs less for Signal to produce a globally distributed communications app. Signal is a nonprofit, but we&#39;re playing in a lane dominated by multi-billion-dollar corporations that have defined the norms and established the tech ecosystem, and whose business models directly contravene our privacy mission. So in order to provide a genuinely useful alternative, Signal spends tens of millions of dollars every year. <em>We estimate that by 2025, Signal will require approximately $50 million dollars a year to operate — and this is very lean compared to other popular messaging apps that don&#39;t respect your privacy.</em></p></blockquote><p> Signal funds itself through voluntary donations. Most of its competitors are funded through advertising. But iMessage is funded through <em>device sales</em> . If it costs $50 million per year to operate Signal, I&#39;d guess it costs Apple more than that to run iMessage.</p><p> I know the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/beeper">Beeper thing</a> is last month&#39;s news, but the fact that iMessage costs a lot of money to operate is generally overlooked by those who think Apple should be forced to “open it up”, whatever that might mean.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Signal Will Cost $50 Million Per Year to Run’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/signal-50m">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://dayoneapp.com/download/daring-fireball/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/va1" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2024/01/day_one_journal_app" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/feeds/sponsors//11.40537</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2024-01-23T01:00:55Z</published><updated> 2024-01-23T01:00:56Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>My thanks to Hey for sponsoring this week at DF to promote their new Hey Calendar.</p><p> Back in 2020 Hey launched their email service with a completely fresh take on a category that hadn&#39;t seen anything new in forever. I&#39;ve been subscribed since it launched, and still find it like nothing else. Their “screener” feature alone is worth it: get an email from someone you never want to see email from again? Just screen them out with a single thumbs-down button click. Those emails aren&#39;t trashed, and they aren&#39;t flagged as spam — they&#39;re screened out of your inbox (or in Hey&#39;s terms, <em>imbox</em> ), but they remain in a “Screened Out” mailbox just in case. Every email app should have something like this.</p><p> Now they&#39;ve done the same with calendaring. The all-new Hey Calendar brings flexibility, personality, and a radical new point of view to the boring old grid of dates.</p><p> So Hey is now both email and a calendar, all-in-one. As you <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/09/hey-calendar-now-in-app-store">may have heard</a> , they&#39;ve got an all-new mobile app for Hey Calendar.也。 Check out how much better things can be at <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY.com</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hey Calendar’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/20/hey-calendar">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Spotify Attacks Apple&#39;s &#39;Outrageous&#39; 27 Percent Commission From External Links </title><link href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68018618" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9z" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/20/spotify-app-store-outrage" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40535</id><published> 2024-01-20T23:26:42Z</published><updated> 2024-01-27T22:06:15Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tom Gerken, writing for BBC News:</p><blockquote><p> On Wednesday, Apple announced it would permit app developers to sell products in places other than its own store — but only if they still paid commission. Spotify said that was “outrageous” and accused Apple of “stopping at nothing” to protect its profits. It is urging the British government to prevent similar fees being levied in the UK. [...]</p><p> Spotify has reacted with fury, saying the policy “flies in the face” of the US court&#39;s attempt to enable greater competition. “Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,” it said in a statement.</p></blockquote><p> I can see why Spotify doesn&#39;t like this, but I&#39;m not sure why Spotify doesn&#39;t qualify under the “reader” app category that can link to external web pages without paying Apple any commission at all. Also, I think Spotify is barking up the wrong tree while complaining about Apple&#39;s compliance with this US court order under the guise of Apple abusing a monopoly — Judge Gonzales specifically ruled that the App Store <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-failed-to-prove-apple-is-a-monopolist-rules-judge.html">does not constitute a monopoly</a> .</p><p> Here&#39;s a simple thought I had today regarding whether Apple&#39;s new External Purchase Links entitlement policy is a good faith effort to comply with Judge Gonzales&#39; order: Will any developers actually choose to use it? Remember, to use this entitlement, developers must:</p><ul><li> <em>Still</em> offer in-app purchases through Apple&#39;s system, alongside external payment links.</li><li> Pay Apple a 27/12 percent commission on sales through external links.</li><li> Report monthly sales to Apple and submit to audits on demand.</li><li> Track users who follow those links so they can determine which sign-ups they owe Apple commission payments for.</li><li> Follow Apple&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">strict design guidelines</a> for presenting those links.</li></ul><p> Or, they could just stick to using IAP exclusively. I&#39;m curious whether any developers at all will consider the new External Payment Links worth implementing. If not, how could it be a reasonable policy? It may well be <em>legal</em> , but bad faith and spite aren&#39;t illegal.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Spotify Attacks Apple’s ‘Outrageous’ 27 Percent Commission From External Links’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/20/spotify-app-store-outrage">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Finally Reveals Vision Pro&#39;s Weight </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-weight-comparirson-meta-quest/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/20/vision-pro-weight" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40533</id><published> 2024-01-20T22:37:21Z</published><updated> 2024-01-20T22:57:23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Tim Bray:</p><blockquote><p> But those Ten Blue Links surfaced by the PageRank-that-was had a special magic. I found them intensely human, a reflection of the voices populating what remains of the Web, the only platform without a vendor. This was true when I was there and I said so, but was laughed at.</p><p> And now, in Anno Domini 2024, Google has lost its edge in search. There are plenty of things it can&#39;t find. There are compelling alternatives. To me this feels like a big inflection point, because around the stumbling feet of the Big Tech dinosaurs, the Web&#39;s mammals, agile and flexible, still scurry. They exhibit creative energy and strongly-flavored voices, and those voices still sometimes find and reinforce each other without being sock puppets of shareholder-value-focused private empires.</p></blockquote><p> That line: <em>the Web&#39;s mammals, agile and flexible, still scurry</em> .</p><p>这引起了共鸣。 I&#39;d expand that to <em>indie</em> mammals, whether writing web or native apps — or often now, both. One of the indie mammals today, one that fits the bill for a “compelling alternative” to Google Search, is <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> . I&#39;d been using DuckDuckGo for many years as my primary search engine, but I switched to Kagi in the summer of 2022 and haven&#39;t looked back. I&#39;ve been paying $10/month for a <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/unlimited-searches-for-10#ultimate">Professional plan</a> (unlimited searches per month, unlimited access to Kagi&#39;s FastGPT and Universal Summarizer) and I&#39;m <em>this close</em> to upgrading to the $25/month Ultimate plan just to support this crazy company.</p><p> Kagi search isn&#39;t just good for a Google alternative, I flat out prefer its results to Google&#39;s. Better results in a far better presentation. The only thing I find myself resorting to Google Search for are <em>old</em> links — when searching for news or specific articles that are, I don&#39;t know, maybe more than 10 years old, no search engine seems able to compete with Google. But for everything else, I prefer Kagi. I go weeks at a time not using Google Search.</p><p> Kagi has no ads — it&#39;s entirely supported by users paying for their excellent service. It&#39;s never going to topple Google, but the man behind Kagi, Vladimir Prelovac, isn&#39;t trying to. He&#39;s just trying to make the best search engine — <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/">and web browser!</a> - 可能的。 Just trying to make something great <em>for users</em> .</p><p> I know: of all the things you thought you&#39;d never pay for, a search engine is probably near the top of the list. But try Kagi out for yourself.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Bray: ‘Mourning Google’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/bray-google-kagi">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> YouTube and Spotify Are Not Launching Vision Pro Apps Either </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/youtube-and-spotify-join-netflix-in-not-launching-apple-vision-pro-apps" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/youtube-spotify-vision-pro" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40528</id><published> 2024-01-19T08:33:35Z</published><updated> 2024-01-20T00:39:22Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman and Ashley Carman, reporting for Bloomberg (Gurman has been killing it this week on the Vision Pro apps beat — he&#39;s breaking all of these stories):</p><blockquote><p> Google&#39;s YouTube and Spotify Technology SA, the world&#39;s most popular video and music services, are joining Netflix Inc. in steering clear of Apple Inc.&#39;s upcoming mixed-reality headset.</p><p> YouTube said in a statement Thursday that it isn&#39;t planning to launch a new app for the Apple Vision Pro, nor will it allow its longstanding iPad application to work on the device — at least, for now. YouTube 和 Netflix 一样，建议客户如果想观看其内容，请使用网络浏览器：“YouTube 用户将能够在 Vision Pro 发布后在 Safari 中使用 YouTube。”</p><p> Spotify also isn&#39;t currently planning a new app for visionOS — the Vision Pro&#39;s operating system — and doesn&#39;t expect to enable its iPad app to run on the device when it launches, according to a person familiar with matter. But the music service will still likely work from a web browser.</p></blockquote><p> Spotify&#39;s fuck-you to Apple I don&#39;t find surprising, given the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/27/spotify-airplay">longstanding animosity</a> between them. But YouTube is a surprise to me, and it&#39;s a sign of how profoundly different the relationship is between Google and Apple today from the pre-Android era. In 2007, before third-party apps were even supported on iOS, YouTube was a built-in app on the original iPhone. (Apple designed and made the app; Google provided the back-end APIs and, obviously, the content.) Then-Google-CEO (and then-Apple-board-member!) Eric Schmidt was invited on stage by Steve Jobs to demo the YouTube app and sing the praises of both the iPhone and the Apple-Google partnership. That Apple-made Google-supported YouTube app was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_3">still a built-in default app on iOS when the iPad launched in 2010</a> .</p><p> So for both the original iPhone and iPad, YouTube was part of the system software. For Vision Pro, there&#39;s no app at all, not even the iPad app.</p><p> Regarding Netflix&#39;s pass on Vision Pro, a little birdie informed me that until this week, the Netflix iPad app was available for those with access to Vision Pro hardware, and it worked just fine. This birdie still has the Netflix iPad app installed on their Vision Pro. Perhaps people at Netflix would disagree with just how well it worked — I don&#39;t know — but I get the strong impression that the decision was political/strategic/spiteful, not technical. Entertainment is not the sole purpose of Vision Pro, but it&#39;s a major one — and surely the primary one for many buyers — and it&#39;s launching without the two biggest video entertainment apps in the world. Apple expected Netflix&#39;s iPad app to be there on launch day.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a dealbreaker — watching Netflix through Safari should be OK (albeit without offline downloads, a huge factor for using Vision Pro on airplanes), and many people think of YouTube as a website, not an app. But there&#39;s no way around it: this is a bad look for Apple, not for Netflix or Google. The buck stops with Tim Cook on this. He should have been on the horn with Ted Sarandos and Sundar Pichai and worked this out. It&#39;s his company that&#39;s launching a $3,500 headset.</p><p> It&#39;s also worth pointing out that these corporate pissing matches are reciprocal. They work in <em>both</em> directions. I doubt we&#39;ll see any calls for Netflix, YouTube, or Spotify to be investigated by antitrust regulators over their refusal to allow their iPad apps to run on Vision Pro. But imagine if Netflix and Spotify <em>wanted</em> to be on Vision Pro on launch day and Apple refused, to leave more room in the spotlight for Apple TV+ and Apple Music.

<p>Lauren Goode, writing at Wired:</p><blockquote><p> Apple seems to not want you to notice the battery. The external battery pack barely appears on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">product page</a> on Apple&#39;s website, showing up only at the end of a photo gallery at the bottom of the page. And in demo sessions this week, Apple told journalists they were not allowed to snap photos or capture any video of the hardware, an unusual rule for a press briefing. Instead, the company had its own photographer take photos during the Vision Pro demos. Every photo you&#39;ve seen this week of reporters sitting on a couch while wearing the headset were shot by Apple.</p><p> Notably, the battery pack doesn&#39;t appear in any of them. One attendee chose to run the attached cable down the back of his sweatshirt. In <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/C2K7mzQxXru?hl=en">another shared image</a> , of The Verge&#39;s Nilay Patel, the cable is clearly visible, but the photo is cropped to avoid showing the battery pack. Chokkattu experienced this too; he set the Vision Pro&#39;s battery pack on the couch cushion next to him during his demo, but in the photo Apple shared with us, the offending pack is cropped out of the frame.</p></blockquote><p> To Apple&#39;s credit, they weren&#39;t at all cagey about this when they took <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111767493035111862">my picture</a> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/C2LKPu5P0Wu">using Vision Pro</a> Tuesday. They asked if I&#39;d like photos taken by their photographer (who used an iPhone 15 Pro), I said sure, and they suggested draping the battery cable behind my back. It&#39;s not just Apple being weird about the external battery; it&#39;s that the external battery <em>is</em> weird. So of course their photography is going to de-emphasize it.</p><p> Almost every first-generation product has things like this <sup>*</sup> — glaring deficiencies dictated by the limits of technology. The original Mac had far too little RAM (128 KB) and far too little storage (a single <a href="https://lowendmac.com/2016/floppy-disk-compatibility-and-incompatibility-in-the-mac-world/">400 KB single-sided floppy disk drive</a> ). The original iPhone only supported 2G EDGE cellular networking, which was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_rates_for_GSM_Evolution#:~:text=EDGE%20can%20carry%20a%20bandwidth,much%20traffic%20as%20standard%20GPRS.">unfathomably slow</a> and didn&#39;t work at all while you were on a voice call. The original Apple Watch was very slow and struggled to last a full day on a single charge. The external battery pack — which only supplies 2 to 2.5 hours of battery life — is that for this first-gen Vision Pro. Also, the Vision Pro headset itself — without any built-in battery — is still too big and too heavy.</p><p> <a href="https://paulgraham.com/really.html">Paul Graham has a wonderful adage</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Don&#39;t worry what people will say.

<p>From an updated footnote in Apple&#39;s “How to Use the Blood Oxygen App on Apple Watch” support page:</p><blockquote><p> The ability to measure Blood Oxygen is no longer available on Apple Watch units sold by Apple in the United States on or after January 18, 2024. These are indicated with part numbers ending in LW/A.</p></blockquote><p> Apple refuses to say so, but it seems clear that this is a <em>software</em> change. These new watch units still have the blood-oxygen sensor, but the sensor is disabled by software. This workaround definitely does <em>not</em> apply to already-sold watches, even after those watches upgrade to future versions of WatchOS. The reason why is that the ITC injunction is an import ban. Apple is banned from importing watches that violate Masimo&#39;s patents. Units that have already been sold aren&#39;t affected by an import ban.</p><p> The software workaround is clearly distinguishing which watches can continue to use the blood-oxygen sensor and which can&#39;t by checking the device identifiers or serial numbers or something. This is why it took Apple a few weeks to come up with this solution: they needed to retool production to produce units with distinguishable part numbers. It would have been trivial to just disable the sensor on all watches, old and new alike, with a WatchOS update. (Although existing owners would likely refuse to update.)</p><p> Apple also refuses to say so, but it seems clear that these new units will have the blood-oxygen sensors enabled in a future software update if and when they win on appeal or otherwise settle with Masimo. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s just a question of <em>when</em> , but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/masimo-ceo-better-off-without">maybe it&#39;s an <em>if</em></a> .</p><p> (Because the ban was instituted by the International Trade Commission, I believe Apple could tell Masimo to go fuck themselves if Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 were manufactured in America, because an import ban wouldn&#39;t matter.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘More on Apple’s Software Workaround for the Apple Watch Import Ban’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/more-on-apple-watch-software-workaround">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Masimo CEO on Apple Watch Blood-Oxygen Sensor: &#39;I Really Feel Wholeheartedly That Consumers Are Better Off Without It&#39; </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/masimo-ceo-says-users-are-better-off-without-apple-s-oxygen-tool" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/19/masimo-ceo-better-off-without" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40525</id><published> 2024-01-19T06:15:31Z</published><updated> 2024-01-19T06:15:31Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman and Edward Ludlow, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Customers should buy pulse oximeters from Masimo or others instead, [Masimo CEO Joe] Kiani said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg TV. “Apple is masquerading what they are offering to consumers as a reliable, medical pulse oximeter, even though it is not,” he said. “I really feel wholeheartedly that consumers are better off without it.”</p><p> Apple said that Kiani&#39;s claims are false and that its watch&#39;s blood oxygen feature is accurate, works very well for customers and in some cases can save lives.</p></blockquote><p> Tell us what you really think, Joe.</p><blockquote><p> Masimo&#39;s CEO said he hasn&#39;t spoken to Apple personally about a settlement, and that nobody from Apple has reached out about coming to an agreement.</p><p> “There are court-ordered mediations that I cannot get into that have been held before,” he said. “And there will be additional meetings probably in the future.”</p><p> Kiani added that he doesn&#39;t consider those meetings to be steps toward settling litigation.

<p>Brent Simmons, “ <a href="https://inessential.com/2024/01/17/corporations_are_not_to_be_loved">Corporations Are Not to Be Loved</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Apple doesn&#39;t care about you personally in the least tiny bit, and if you were in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might — effectively infinite compared to your own — enables them to deal with you.</p><p> Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the sixth finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple&#39;s policies for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">Distributing apps in the US that provide an external purchase link</a> are startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that Apple is not a real person and not worthy of your爱。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement">I wrote yesterday</a> about Apple damaging their brand and reputation with this policy. I&#39;m friends — close friends, in many cases, perhaps <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/vesper+brent+simmons">especially</a> in Brent&#39;s case — with many longtime indie Mac developers. I&#39;m up to at least half a dozen instances now where group chat discussions have turned to concerns that Apple might assert the same demand for a 27 percent cut of all Mac software. Meaning not just apps in the Mac App Store, but apps from outside the Mac App Store — even apps that are <em>only</em> available outside the Mac App Store. Even apps from developers who don&#39;t have any apps in the Mac App Store. There&#39;s now genuine concern that Apple is going to declare that they want a 27/12 percent revenue cut from all Mac software, full stop.</p><p> I&#39;m disappointed by Apple&#39;s decision to demand their commission from sales on the web linked from within iOS apps, but not surprised. But I can&#39;t emphasize enough how flabbergasted many developers are — nor how offended. (Brent was too polite to point out that Apple&#39;s external links policy is also a proverbial third finger.)</p><p> Prior to MacOS 10.12 Sierra, MacOS had three options in the Security &amp; Privacy panel of System Preferences (as it was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/06/basic_app_guy_mac_settings">then named</a> <sup id="fnr1-2024-01-18"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-18">1</a></sup> ) for the sources of apps permitted to run: “App Store”, “App Store and identified developers”, and “Anywhere”. <em>Identified developers</em> means apps from outside the App Store that are cryptographically signed by both Apple and a developer with an Apple developer account. Starting with 10.12 Sierra, <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/macos-10-12-sierra/#jp-carousel-16675">the “Anywhere” option was removed</a> . You can still re-enable the ability to run unsigned software, but <a href="https://macpaw.com/amp/how-to/allow-apps-anywhere">you need to run an administrator-authenticated command</a> in Terminal ( <code>sudo spctl --master-disable</code> ).</p><p> So, practically speaking, commercial Mac software must be signed, and Apple controls signing. That means Apple <em>could</em> , technically, attempt to demand such a commission (along with the arduous monthly accounting of sales, and the profoundly intrusive option to demand an audit at any time).</p><p> I am convinced that Apple has no such intention. I think I understand how Apple views iOS (including its sibling derivatives iPadOS, tvOS, and now VisionOS) as an altogether different type of platform than the Mac. If it were up to Apple, the External Purchase Link Entitlement on iOS wouldn&#39;t exist, because they&#39;re only allowing external purchase links in apps because a court decision demanded it — and thus isn&#39;t an indication of what they want to do with the Mac. The general-purpose-computing flexibility and power of the Mac is <em>necessary</em> , not just <em>nice to have</em> , or <em>the way things have always been</em> .</p><p> Back in 2010, when the iPad was just six months old (and ran “iOS”), I wrote a piece titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/12/future_of_the_mac_in_an_ios_world">The Future of the Mac in an iOS World</a> ”. The whole thing holds up and is worth a re-read (or first read, if you didn&#39;t read it then). But I&#39;ll quote the nut of it here:</p><blockquote><p> For all the aforementioned growth in Mac sales — remarkable by any measure, but especially so for a 25-year-old platform — the iPad, just six months old, is already outselling the Mac. Here&#39;s the short version of the “Mac is doomed” scenario: iOS is the future, Mac OS X is the past, and Apple, unlike most major tech companies, is strongly inclined to abandon the past in the name of the future.</p><p> You can&#39;t really argue with that, can you? But the premise that the end is near for the Mac presupposes quite a bit about the near-term future of iOS. [...]</p><p> The central conceit of the iPad is that it&#39;s a portable computer that does less — and because it does less, what it does do, it does better, more simply, and more elegantly. Apple can only begin phasing out the Mac if and when iOS expands to allow us to do everything we can do on the Mac. It&#39;s the heaviness of the Mac that allows iOS to remain light.</p><p> When I say that iOS has no baggage, that&#39;s not because there is no baggage. It&#39;s because the Mac is there to carry it. Long term — say, ten years out — well, all good things must come to an end. But in the short term, Mac OS X has an essential role in an iOS world: serving as the platform for complex, resource-intensive tasks.</p></blockquote><p> If there&#39;s one thing I wish I had added to that description of the Mac&#39;s essential role in the entire Apple ecosystem, it&#39;s that it&#39;s also <em>the</em> platform for whatever software developers can imagine and build, with no limits or rules other than the APIs — public or private — available in the system itself. And the only mistake I made in that column was thinking the Mac might have then only had a 10-year window of relevance remaining. The Mac today, at 40 years old, <sup id="fnr2-2024-01-18"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-18">2</a></sup> is if anything stronger and more essential than it was at 25. The move from Intel to Apple silicon is proof to my mind that Apple remains fully committed to the Mac. I now think it&#39;s a forever platform, where <em>forever</em> is at least as far into the future as I can imagine. Decades, plural.</p><p> Essential to the Mac&#39;s continuing relevance is that it is continuously evolving. Much has changed since 2010, and much will surely change between now and the Mac&#39;s 50th anniversary in 2034. But one thing that can&#39;t change without destroying it is its openness to software outside Apple&#39;s control. The Mac is a PC. The others, to borrow a term, are post-PC devices. I am convinced that every executive at Apple who needs to understand that does, and that a scheme along the lines of iOS&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">External Purchase Link Entitlement</a> has never even been <em>considered</em> for the Mac. Everyone I know at Apple, from the trenches to the executive ranks, <em>loves</em> the Mac. Most of them went to work at Apple because of the Mac. They know that the Macintosh without Adobe, without Microsoft, without the indie developers who craft software that can only exist outside the Mac App Store, wouldn&#39;t be the Macintosh at all. And there&#39;s zero chance Adobe, Microsoft, or any of the indie shops I know would agree to <em>any</em> sort of mandatory revenue share, let alone a hefty one. <sup id="fnr3-2024-01-18"><a href="#fn3-2024-01-18">3</a></sup></p><p> But I don&#39;t sell Mac software. Among those who do, not only do they not share my confidence that Apple would do no such thing — they&#39;re genuinely concerned that it might be inevitable. “You don&#39;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows” is one of Bob Dylan&#39;s best lines, and this week&#39;s External Purchase Link Entitlement policy for iOS is a gust of foul-smelling wind so strong it demands a weather advisory.</p><p> Developer uncertainty regarding the viability of selling Mac software is the last thing needed for a platform that is already facing a dearth of new original native software. Apple doesn&#39;t have to make a platform-destructive money-grab policy change to ruin the Mac. They can ruin it simply by planting the seed of doubt that they <em>might</em> .</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2024-01-18"><p> Not only has System Preferences been renamed (and redesigned) as Settings, the panel then called “Security &amp; Privacy” is now “Privacy &amp; Security”.细节。 <a href="#fnr1-2024-01-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2024-01-18"><p> Lost in the hubbub surrounding the imminent launch of the Vision spatial computing platform is the fact that the Mac&#39;s 40th anniversary comes next week, Wednesday January 24.

<p>Mark Gurman:</p><blockquote><p> Netflix Inc. isn&#39;t planning to launch an app for Apple Inc.&#39;s upcoming Vision Pro headset, marking a high-profile snub of the new technology by the world&#39;s biggest video subscription service.</p><p> Rather than designing a Vision Pro app — or even just supporting its existing iPad app on the platform — Netflix is essentially taking a pass. The company, which competes with Apple in streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching its content on the device can do so from the web. [...]</p><p> The fact that Netflix isn&#39;t even willing to support the iPad approach suggests that it&#39;s taking a wait-and-see stance with the headset. It&#39;s also a bit of a reversal for the company, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l?sref=9hGJlFio">said in July</a> that it would support its iPad app on the Vision Pro. Even then, though, Netflix didn&#39;t plan to release software specifically for the headset&#39;s operating system, visionOS.</p></blockquote><p> “Said in July” links to a report from Gurman himself, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l?sref=9hGJlFio">which states</a> :</p><blockquote><p> But the biggest streamer of all, Netflix Inc., will take a pass. I&#39;m told that the company has no current plans to develop a native app for the Vision Pro. Of course, Netflix will still let its iPad app run on the headset unmodified.</p></blockquote><p> “当然”！</p><p> Here&#39;s the statement from Netflix:</p><blockquote><p> “Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement.</p></blockquote><p> Mac users sure do <em>enjoy</em> <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/54816">not being able to download Netflix movies or shows</a> for offline viewing — you know, like in an airplane, one of the most obvious and common places where Vision Pro will be used.</p><p> Not having a native VisionOS app is one thing. Apparently having no current plans to make one is another. But it really feels like pure corporate spite — a pissing match — that Netflix is refusing to allow their iPad app to run on VisionOS. The iPad-app-on-Vision experience is actually pretty good, and for streaming apps in particular, ought to be fine. Not impressive, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/disney-plus-visionos">like the native VisionOS Disney+ app</a> , but just fine. I&#39;ll bet that Netflix is the <em>only</em> major streaming service without an app on VisionOS — iPad or native — on day one. Perhaps Netflix is using this as a negotiating tactic for something in return from Apple?</p><p> In addition to the fact that only being available through the web means no offline viewing, it might also mean that VisionOS users will not be able to launch Netflix from their home screens. I&#39;m not sure if VisionOS Safari has an “Add to Home Screen” feature, but if it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s going to be an annoyance for Vision Pro users who want to watch Netflix. Telling Siri to open “netflix dot com” might be the only way to get there from your home screen.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Netflix Has No App for VisionOS’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/18/netflix-has-no-app-for-visionos">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Will Begin Selling Series 9 and Ultra Watches With Blood Oxygen Sensors Disabled Tomorrow </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-without-blood-oxygen-sensor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-disabled-sensors" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40522</id><published> 2024-01-18T04:32:36Z</published><updated> 2024-01-18T04:32:36Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Apple, a court filing spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Florian4Gamers/status/1738673544572162438">Florian Mueller</a> at Games Fray:</p><blockquote><p> Please take notice that on March 5, 2024 at 10:00 am, or as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard by the Court, at the courtroom of the Honorable Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, [...] Apple Inc. (“Apple”) will and hereby does move that this Court, pursuant to the mandate of the Ninth Circuit, enter judgment ordering Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) to pay Apple $73,404,326, plus additional amounts Apple is incurring during this ongoing litigation, under the indemnification provision of the Developer Program License Agreement.</p></blockquote><p> This is not simply about Epic having sued Apple and lost; it&#39;s about the fact that this whole saga started with Epic&#39;s Fortnite in-app payment processing stunt, blatantly violating <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/#ADPLA10">the Developer Program License Agreement</a> . This wasn&#39;t like an edge case or technicality; Epic deliberately violated the clear rules of the DPLA as a publicity stunt to launch their antitrust lawsuit.

If Epic had prevailed on antitrust, the contract clause wouldn&#39;t have been enforceable. [...]</p><p> Apple does this as a matter of principle. They won&#39;t leave an amount in the tens of millions on the table. And their overall treatment of Epic, such as not putting Fortnite back, is meant to discourage other app makers from challenging Apple and from breaching the DPLA.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s unsurprising but worth noting that <em>Fortnite</em> is seemingly never coming back to iOS, unless Epic sells the franchise to another company. iOS <em>Fortnite</em> players are like the children in an ugly divorce.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Set to Collect $73 Million in Legal Fees From Epic Games’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/17/apple-epic-legal-fees">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9k" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024://1.40520</id><published> 2024-01-17T21:59:34Z</published><updated> 2024-01-17T23:02:23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, it&#39;s never a good idea to piss off the refs. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747280541362102287/">Tim Sweeney, on Twitter/X, yesterday at 10:30am</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over and done forever.</p></blockquote><p> That take didn&#39;t last long.</p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390">Sweeney, yesterday at 7:00pm</a> , after Apple released <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-guidelines-external-purchase-links">the details of its intended compliance</a> with the anti-steering ( <em>anti-anti-steering</em> ?) mandate from the Epic v. Apple case:</p><blockquote><p> A quick summary of glaring problems we&#39;ve found so far:</p><ol><li> Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web purchases.苹果以前从未这样做过，它扼杀了价格竞争。 Developers can&#39;t offer digital items more cheaply on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.</li></ol><p> [Sweeney&#39;s points 2–4, complaining about Apple&#39;s stringent design, presentation, and privacy demands regarding external links, omitted.]</p><p> Epic will contest Apple&#39;s bad-faith compliance plan in District Court.</p></blockquote><p> Sweeney&#39;s description makes it sound as though Apple is demanding its commission from all web sales for apps and services that have an iOS app.他们不是。 They&#39;re only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">the new External Purchase Links entitlement</a> in an app. Any app or service that already sells over the web, without paying a cent to Apple, can continue to do so in exactly the same way.</p><p> Also, Apple <em>has</em> done this before: what they announced yesterday is almost exactly in line <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with their compliance with Netherlands regulations pertaining to dating apps in 2022</a> .</p><p> Before yesterday:</p><ul><li> iOS app developers could sell digital content and subscriptions over the web, without paying Apple any commission.</li><li> iOS apps outside <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">the “reader” category</a> could not link to, nor even tell users about, those web purchases from within their apps.</li></ul><p> After yesterday:</p><ul><li> Apps that wish to link to — or, I think, even inform users about — web purchasing options from within their iOS apps must (a) still offer Apple&#39;s IAP for those items; (b) pay Apple its adjusted 27/12 percent commissions on web sales that come from inside iOS apps; (c) send Apple sales data monthly and submit to audits of their sales; and (d) follow Apple&#39;s stringent design edicts for these in-app links to the web.</li><li> Apps that do not link out to their web stores from within their iOS apps using Apple&#39;s new External Purchase Links entitlement can continue whatever they were doing before yesterday. For apps that do nothing new, Apple is collecting nothing new.</li></ul><p> I&#39;m only surprised that Sweeney was seemingly surprised by any of this. He genuinely seemed to think that Apple not only would, but <em>had to</em> allow links from within apps to the web for purchases without collecting any commission on those sales, and that developers could present those links however they chose.</p><p> I&#39;m glad that Sweeney and Epic plan to contest this, because I&#39;m genuinely curious whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sees Apple&#39;s solution as complying with her injunction against their prior anti-steering rules. But I think it <em>does</em> comply.</p><hr /><p> To be clear, I think Apple should allow apps <em>other than games</em> to just tell users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission. That the rules which have applied only to “reader” apps since early 2022 should be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which doesn&#39;t apply to “reader” apps) that apps taking advantage of this <em>also</em> offer in-app purchasing.</p><p> I&#39;d draw an exception for games — an exception that surely Sweeney would disagree with completely, given that he&#39;s in the games business — because games are different, and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly standard for the video game industry 。 The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; they&#39;re consoles for games and apps.</p><p> But I&#39;m not sure at all that Apple is doing anything contrary to the law. Sweeney (and other critics of Apple&#39;s stewardship of iOS as a tightly controlled console) believe Apple both shouldn&#39;t and <em>legally can&#39;t</em> comply with the anti-steering injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldn&#39;t, not that they legally can&#39;t.</p><p> Most critics of Apple&#39;s control over all iOS software are seemingly of the view that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of “expert” or “developer” mode</a> — chock full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enable — that would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on iOS as there are on the Mac. That&#39;s me, personally, an expert user. But even setting aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store, <sup id="fnr1-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-17">1</a></sup> I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldn&#39;t want to do this. There are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software. I&#39;m not talking about viruses or malware, even — but apps that just abuse the largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.</p><p> Basically, there&#39;s an argument that iOS devices should be more like traditional PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The “ <em>it&#39;s my device, I should decide and control what software runs on it</em> ” argument.我得到它。 But I also get that most consumers&#39; Windows PCs, and many Macs, <sup id="fnr2-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-17">2</a></sup> are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/">anti-user shenanigans</a> you&#39;d never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far from perfect — I mean come on, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection">that should go without saying</a> — but it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for <em>any</em> typical users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall if you don&#39;t like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox — and to a lesser degree (because Google&#39;s Play Store review seems comparatively lax) for Android.</p><p> But the cynical take is that it&#39;s all about the money for Apple. Maybe the cynics are right! Let&#39;s just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple <em>should not</em> be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are taking to the company&#39;s brand and reputation — this move reeks of greed and avarice — nor the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the “anti-Big-Tech” hunt.</p><p> Apple should have been looking for ways to <em>lessen</em> regulatory and legislative pressure over the past few years, and in today&#39;s climate that&#39;s more true than ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been “ <em>Bring it on.</em> ” Confrontational, not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with <em>most</em> of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep <em>everything</em> . To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponent&#39;s king. Apple seemingly wants to capture every last piece on the board — even while playing in a tournament where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship (greed).</p><p> Apple&#39;s calculus should be to balance its natural desire to book large amounts of revenue from the App Store with policies that to some degree <em>placate</em> , rather than antagonize, regulators and legislators. No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, it&#39;s never a good idea to piss off the refs.</p><p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol></p><p><li id="fn1-2024-01-17"></p><p> That&#39;s a metric buttload of pennies to set aside, to be sure. <a href="#fnr1-2024-01-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p><p></li></p><p><li id="fn2-2024-01-17"></p><p> iOS App Store policy critics often point to the Mac as all the evidence they need that Apple could open up software distribution on iOS with no ill effects to users. I wrote about this back in 2021, in a piece titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">Annotating Apple&#39;s Anti-Sideloading White Paper</a> ”. Quoting from that column, which begins with a quote from <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps.pdf">Apple&#39;s white paper</a> :</p><blockquote><p>第 9 页：</p><blockquote><p> iPhone is used every day by over a billion people — for banking, to manage health data, and to take pictures of their families. This large user base would make an appealing and lucrative target for cybercriminals and scammers, and allowing sideloading would spur a flood of new investment into attacks on iPhone, well beyond the scale of attacks on other platforms like Mac.</p></blockquote><p> Here Apple dances around the elephant in the room — the question of why iOS shouldn&#39;t just work like the Mac with regard to non-App Store software. Apple&#39;s deft argument is that there are far fewer Macs than iOS devices, making the Mac a less enticing target for scammers and crooks (including privacy crooks). That&#39;s more or less the argument Windows proponents used to explain the profound prevalence of malware on Windows compared to the Mac back in the day, whilst Apple (and Mac proponents) argued otherwise, that the Mac actually was far more secure at a technical level.</p><p> But the truth Apple won&#39;t come out and say is that it&#39;s <em>both</em> . The Mac <em>was</em> more secure by design, but <em>also</em> a far less enticing target because of how many more users were (and still are) on Windows. And, today, iOS <em>is</em> more secure and private than the Mac. That&#39;s the nature of the Mac as a full PC platform.</p><p> I&#39;ll admit it: if Mac-style sideloading were added to iOS, I&#39;d enable it, for the same reason I enable installing apps from outside the App Store on my Mac: I trust myself to only install trustworthy software. But it doesn&#39;t make me a hypocrite to say that I think it would be worse for the platform as a whole.</p><p> The Mac is fundamentally designed for users who are at least <em>somewhat</em> technically savvy, but tries its best to keep non-savvy users from doing things they shouldn&#39;t. But you can always hurt yourself, sometimes badly, with any true power tool. The iPhone is the converse: designed first and foremost for the non-savvy user, and tries to accommodate power users as best it can within the limits of that primary directive.</p></blockquote><p><p> All the more pertinent today, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/vestager_cook">as Apple faces down the March 7 deadline for compliance with the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act</a> that ostensibly mandates sideloading on iOS. <a href="#fnr2-2024-01-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></li></p><p></ol></div></p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Coming to Grips With Apple&#39;s Seemingly Unshakable Sense of Entitlement to Its Commissions From Third-Party iOS Apps</title></entry><entry><title> Apple&#39;s Workaround for the ITC&#39;s Import Ban on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2: Disabling the Blood-Oxygen Sensor in Software </title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-watch-redesigned-without-blood-oxygen-monitoring-to-avoid-import-ban/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v9j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-workaround-itc-import-ban" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40519</id><published> 2024-01-17T04:14:41Z</published><updated> 2024-01-17T18:23:58Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Scharon Harding, reporting for Ars Technica:</p><blockquote><p> Apple has developed a backup plan for if the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 are import banned again. As it currently appeals the US International Trade Commission&#39;s (ITC&#39;s) ruling that its watches violate a patent owned by Masimo, Apple has come up with a software workaround that strips its current smartwatches of their controversial blood oxygen monitoring capabilities.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a good summary of Apple&#39;s workaround from a writer who understands what she&#39;s talking about. Apple will disable blood-oxygen monitoring via software.</p><p> Compare and contrast with Aaron Tilley&#39;s report for The Wall Street Journal, under the jacktastically-wrong headline “ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-watch-ban-united-states-update-cd069ab4">Apple to Remove Blood-Oxygen Sensor From Watch to Avoid US Ban</a> ” ( <a href="https://apple.news/A0oSSFm6wTy2vmPERu7MhRQ">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Apple is removing a blood-oxygen sensor from some of its smartwatches to get around a patent dispute related to the technology, a step likely to avoid further sales disruptions but one that may raise questions about the company&#39;s push into health. [...]</p><p> The US Customs and Border Protection agency, which is responsible for enforcing import bans, on Friday approved technical changes to the watches, including the removal of the blood-oxygen sensor, according to a Masimo filing on Monday. A decision on Apple&#39;s request for a permanent stay on the US ban during its appeal is expected in the coming days.</p></blockquote><p> Ars includes <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Masimo-letter-January-15.pdf">a link to Masimo&#39;s filing</a> ; the WSJ does not. Needless to say, Masimo&#39;s filing does <em>not</em> say that Apple is removing the blood-oxygen sensor from these watches, because they&#39;re not. They&#39;re just disabling the sensors via software for watches sold in the US — the only country where the import ban applies.</p><p> This is no little mistake on Tilley&#39;s and the Journal&#39;s part. Disabling a feature via software is one thing, and not that big a deal. Designing, engineering, and manufacturing entirely different hardware models without the physical sensors would be extraordinary. That&#39;s just not how Apple works — they&#39;re not set up to change manufacturing like that. Plus, if Apple merely disables the sensor via software, they can re-enable it via a software update in the future, once the dispute is settled. If they were to start selling Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches that didn&#39;t have the sensor, those watches would <em>never</em> gain the functionality, even after the dispute is settled.</p><p> Aaron Tilley isn&#39;t just a tech reporter for the Journal: his entire beat is covering Apple. And he seemingly has no idea how the company functions, because if he did, he&#39;d have quadruple checked this “they&#39;re removing the sensors” take before publishing it. But here it is a day after publication and his report has yet to be corrected.

<p>Apple Developer News:</p><blockquote><p> In addition to using Apple&#39;s convenient, safe, and secure in-app purchase system, apps on the App Store in the United States that offer in-app purchases can also use the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement (US) to include a link to the developer&#39;s website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital goods or services. To use the entitlement, you&#39;ll need to submit a request, enable the entitlement in Xcode, and use required StoreKit APIs. Apple will review your app to ensure it complies with the terms and conditions of the entitlement, as well as the App Store Review Guidelines and the Apple Developer Program License Agreement. [...]</p><p> Your app must offer in-app purchases in accordance with the Developer Program License Agreement and App Store Review Guidelines, and may not discourage end-users from making in-app purchases.</p></blockquote><p> Apple clearly had these updated guidelines ready to go, pending this week&#39;s decision from the US Supreme Court <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/scotus-epic-apple">rejecting the remaining petitions from Apple and Epic</a> .</p><p> Scroll down the page, then scroll some more, and you&#39;ll get to the section on “Commission, transaction reports, and payments”:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is charging a commission on digital purchases initiated within seven days from link out, as described below. This will not capture all transactions that Apple has facilitated through the App Store, but is a reasonable means to account for the substantial value Apple provides developers, including in facilitating linked transactions.</p><p> Apple&#39;s commission will be 27% on proceeds you earn from sales (“transactions“) to the user for digital goods or services on your website after a link out (ie, they tap “Continue” on the system disclosure sheet), provided that the sale was initiated within seven days and the digital goods or services can be used in an app. This includes (a) any applicable taxes and (b) any adjustments for refunds, reversals and chargebacks. For auto-renewing subscriptions, (i) a sale initiated, including with a free trial or offer, within seven days after a link out is a transaction; and (ii) each subsequent auto-renewal after the subscription is initiated is also a transaction.]</p><p> If you&#39;re a participant in the Small Business Program, or if the transaction is an auto-renewal in the second year or later of an auto-renewing subscription, the commission will be 12%.</p><p> These commission rates apply to all amounts paid by each user net of transaction taxes charged by you. You will be responsible for the collection and remittance of any applicable taxes for sales processed by a third-party payment provider.</p><p> If you adopt this entitlement, you will be required to provide transaction reports within 15 calendar days following the end of each calendar month. Even if there were no transactions, you&#39;re required to provide a report stating that is the case.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve said it before, I&#39;ll say it again now, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have to say it again in the future: Apple&#39;s 30/15 percent commissions from App Store purchases and subscriptions are <em>not</em> payment processing fees. They <em>include</em> payment processing fees, but most of those commissions are, in Apple&#39;s view, their way of monetizing their intellectual property. And they see the entire iOS platform as their IP.</p><p> So developers who want to process payments on their own websites are still on the hook to pay Apple the same effective commissions, minus only 3 percent for the actual payment processing. And the truth is most of the time credit card processing costs more than 3 percent overall, after chargebacks and fraud are taken into consideration.

<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney:</p><blockquote><p> The Supreme Court denied both sides&#39; appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers.</p><p> Now the District Court&#39;s injunction against Apple&#39;s anti-steering rule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps “buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP”.</p><p> As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s sad for Epic, perhaps, and game developers in general, but I think overall this is a good day for developers, and a great day for users. In-app game purchases are already too predatory, as things stand — they&#39;d get far worse if games on iOS were free to circumvent Apple&#39;s system. If a developer wants users to sign up and pay on their website, they can now tell them so, in plain language, in the app.</p><p> The truth should never be against the rules.

<p>Adi Robertson, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> The Supreme Court has denied a request to hear an antitrust dispute between Apple and <em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games. It <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011624zor_e1pf.pdf">rejected two petitions</a> , one from each company, this morning — leaving the case largely, but not entirely, a win for Apple. [...]</p><p> Even so, both rulings found that Apple had acted anticompetitively by barring developers from telling users about other payment methods. Apple was ordered to let them allow links and other “calls to action” that would bypass Apple&#39;s payment system, discontinuing what are known as anti-steering policies. But the company spent years delaying parts of the change with legal appeals, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826043/epic-apple-app-store-supreme-court-petition">winning a reprieve while</a> the Supreme Court considered the case. Today&#39;s denial seemingly runs out that clock, requiring Apple to reconsider the future of its anti-steering rules.</p></blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s intransigence on these anti-steering provisions has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">long baffled me</a> . I&#39;ve consistently argued that the rules should be simple: apps that want to accept in-app payments must use Apple&#39;s IAP system, but apps should be free to inform users that they can sign up and pay on the web, outside the app. In-app: Apple&#39;s platform, Apple&#39;s payments system. Out-app: the open web, and apps should be able to steer customers there. If Apple&#39;s in-app purchasing system is so easy to use, so reasonably priced for its benefits, and so trusted by users, it should be able to compete openly with the web. And I think Apple&#39;s in-app payments <em>do</em> compare favorably to leaving an app to pay on the web, especially for games. But with true competition from web purchases that apps can steer users to, Apple&#39;s commission rates, for apps other than games at least, would probably be lower. I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s unhealthy for a company to grow dependent on unnaturally high commissions protected by fiat policies, rather than set through open competition.</p><p> Perhaps Apple&#39;s thinking was that they might as well try to hold the line on these anti-steering provisions for as long as they could, thinking that today&#39;s outcome was the worst case scenario. But I think it&#39;s been a bad look for the company for years, and invited additional regulatory scrutiny. Regardless of whether these anti-steering provisions are <em>legally</em> anticompetitive, they&#39;re undeniably anticompetitive in the plain sense of the word. I genuinely believe the Supreme Court has done Apple a favor letting this ruling stand.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Supreme Court Rejects Petitions in Epic v.

<p>Ben Schoon, writing for 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> For a case built for this express purpose, the keys are crucial to get right, and Clicks has nailed it, I think. The keys are rounded and have a bit of space in between each one, but the layout overall feels familiar and well done. The keyboard layout is also specifically designed to be really similar to the default iOS keyboard, which makes it feel all the more familiar.</p><p> Each key is also backlit and has an excellent tactile response. That&#39;s the aspect I was most concerned about, and while some of the pre-production models were a little rough, the final version that I was able to test during my hands-on (not pictured) felt <em>perfect</em> . It was clicky and tactile without being loud or too hard to press. [...]</p><p> In my brief time using it, I&#39;m very much of the opinion that Clicks is pretty much as good as this concept can be.

<p>European Commission chief Margrethe Vestager is on the West Coast meeting with US tech executives. Here&#39;s her entire statement on meeting Tim Cook at Apple Park, <a href="https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1745693612262953300">posted on Twitter/X</a> (I&#39;m surprised she posts on a US-based platform, rather than one of the popular EU social networks):</p><blockquote><p> 2 main points from my meeting w/ @tim_cook @apple ⬇️</p><p> 👉 compliance w/ #DMA, eg @Apple&#39;s obligation to allow the distribution of #apps outside the @AppStore</p><p> 👉 ongoing @EU_Competition cases eg @AppleMusic</p></blockquote><p> There are so many meetings and negotiations where I&#39;d pay a veritable fortune to have been a fly on the wall. Vestager meeting with Cook this week was <em>not</em> one. My guess is that absolutely nothing interesting was said. Nothing but platitudes.</p><p> The deadline for compliance with the DMA is March 7, and the big issue for Apple is the App Store: allowing native apps to be installed from outside the store (aka sideloading), and allowing alternative in-app payment methods. My understanding is that Apple has everything prepared for compliance, but, exactly what that&#39;s going to look like, seemingly no one outside the company knows.</p><p> We know nothing about how Apple plans to allow sideloading. I expect that even for users in the EU, sideloading will be off by default. I also expect that, unlike the Mac, sideloaded apps will still need to be signed by Apple. Will apps distributed through the App Store allow third-party in-app payment processing, or will that only be available to sideloaded apps? I further presume, that just like when Apple complied with Dutch regulations specific to dating apps, third-party apps that implement their own payment processing for in-app purchases will be required to provide Apple with detailed accounting and pay Apple a 27% commission.</p><p> Will sideloading <em>only</em> be available within the EU, or will Apple implement the same policies worldwide? For the most part Apple tries to keep things the same worldwide, but sideloading is such an exception that I expect them to region-lock it to the EU Especially given that stipulation that Apple needs to permit sideloaded apps to act as app stores themselves.<em>这</em>将如何运作？</p><p> I expect that Apple has designed sideloading in such a way that very few users will enable it. (This seems to be largely the case on Android, which has permitted off-by-default sideloading from its inception.) I also expect that Apple will still demand 27% of in-app purchase revenue from apps that choose to implement their own payment加工。</p><p> Basically, I don&#39;t think much will change for EU users, or for developers. But a lot of people — including Vestager and the European Commission — expect a <em>lot</em> to change. It&#39;s just not clear at all exactly what Apple needs to allow to comply with the DMA, nor do any of us outside Cupertino have any idea what Apple plans to do. Complying with the <em>letter</em> of the DMA does not mean capitulating to the <em>spirit</em> of the DMA. The idea that Apple is going to roll over and give up on steering their own platform the way they feel best benefits both their own bottom line, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps_A_Threat_Analysis_of_Sideloading.pdf">their users&#39; experience/privacy/security</a> , is naive.</p><p> The European Commission expected that the GDPR would result in websites prioritizing the privacy of EU users — a better web in Europe than elsewhere. Instead, the result was increased user annoyance under a nonstop daily barrage of consent popovers — a <em>worse</em> web in Europe than elsewhere. I suspect the same will prove true of the DMA and mobile platforms. Fireworks are coming, but it seems like few people know it.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Margrethe Vestager Met With Tim Cook Yesterday, But I Doubt Anything Happened</title></entry><entry><title> CNN: &#39;FAA Keeps Boeing&#39;s 737 Max 9 Grounded as It Reviews Inspections and Data&#39; </title><link href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/12/business/boeing-faa-manufacturing-oversight/index.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v99" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/13/faa-keeps-737-maxes-grounded" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2024:/linked//6.40509</id><published> 2024-01-14T00:09:50Z</published><updated> 2024-01-14T00:09:51Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2003/03/19Former-Vice-President-Al-Gore-Joins-Apples-Board-of-Directors/">Apple press release, on 19 March 2003</a> (about seven months after I started writing Daring Fireball <sup id="fnr1-2024-01-12"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-12">1</a></sup> ):</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced that Albert Gore Jr., the former Vice President of the United States, has joined the Company&#39;s Board of Directors. Mr. Gore was elected at Apple&#39;s board meeting today.</p><p> “Al brings an incredible wealth of knowledge and wisdom to Apple from having helped run the largest organization in the world — the United States government — as a Congressman, Senator and our 45th Vice President. Al is also an avid Mac user and does his own video editing in Final Cut Pro,” said Steve Jobs, Apple&#39;s CEO. “Al is going to be a terrific Director and we&#39;re excited and honored that he has chosen Apple as his first private sector board to serve on.”</p></blockquote><p> I love that the second sentence from Jobs was about how Gore is a Mac enthusiast who uses Final Cut Pro. Compare and contrast with today&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/wanda-austin-to-join-apples-board-of-directors/">utterly milquetoast statements from Tim Cook and chairman Arthur Levinson</a> about new board member Wanda Austin:</p><blockquote><p> “Wanda has spent decades advancing technology on behalf of humanity, and we&#39;re thrilled to welcome her to Apple&#39;s board of directors,” said Tim Cook, Apple&#39;s CEO. “She&#39;s an extraordinary leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support our mission of leaving the world better than we found it.”</p><p> “Wanda has long been a leader in unleashing the potential of cutting-edge technology,” said Arthur Levinson, the chair of Apple&#39;s board of directors. “She brings incredible insights and experience to our board, and she will play an important role in helping Apple continue enriching users&#39; lives around the world.”</p></blockquote><p> In 2003 there was one person in the world who could be described as a former vice president of the United States and avid Mac user. (That&#39;s still true today, and that person remains Al Gore.) Cook&#39;s and Levinson&#39;s descriptions of Austin could apply to just about any technology company executive in the world.</p><p> Gore&#39;s statement from 2003:</p><blockquote><p> “Steve and his team have done an incredible job in making Apple once again the very best in the world,” said former Vice President Al Gore. “I have been particularly impressed with the new Mac OS X operating system and the company&#39;s commitment to the open source movement. And I am especially looking forward to working with and learning from the great board members who have guided this legendary company&#39;s inspiring resurgence.”</p></blockquote><p> In 2003, Mac OS X was the most important product for the future of the company, and the open source movement was one of the major stories of the moment.</p><p> Austin&#39;s statement today:</p><blockquote><p> “Like Apple, I&#39;ve always believed in the power of innovation to improve lives, support human potential, and shape a better future,” said Dr. Austin. “I&#39;m honored to join Apple&#39;s board of directors, and I look forward to being part of a company that&#39;s always creating new ways to empower people all over the world.”</p></blockquote><p> She could have said the exact same thing about joining the board of <em>any</em> tech company in the world today. If she serves for 20 years, like Gore did (which is unlikely, given that she&#39;s already 70 and Gore is stepping down because of a policy “directors generally may not stand for reelection after reaching age 75” <sup id="fnr2-2024-01-12"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-12">2</a></sup> ), no one in the year 2044 is going to look back on her statement above and think, <em>Yeah, that captures what was then the current moment for Apple.</em> Austin may well be a perfect candidate to serve on Apple&#39;s board, but there&#39;s nothing in today&#39;s press release that indicates why.</p><p> Gore was widely mocked in the run-up to the 2000 election for supposedly claiming to have “invented the internet”. But he never claimed any such thing. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/">From Snopes</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The claim that Gore was actually trying to take credit for the “invention” of the Internet was plainly just derisive political posturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign. If, for example, Dwight Eisenhower had said in the mid-1960s that he, while president, “took the initiative in creating the Interstate Highway System,” he would not have been the subject of dozens and dozens of editorials lampooning him for claiming he “invented” the concept of highways or implying that he personally went out and dug ditches across the country to help build the roadway. Everyone would have understood that Eisenhower meant he was a driving force behind the legislation that created the highway system, and this was the very same concept Al Gore was expressing about himself with interview remarks about the Internet.
