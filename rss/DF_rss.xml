<p>多米尼克·普雷斯顿（Dominic Preston）为《边缘》（Verge）写道：“ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347690/oppo-find-n5-oneplus-open-2-thinnest-usb-c-ipx9">Oppo的下一个可折叠与USB-C所允许的稀薄”</a> ：</p><blockquote><p>在过去的一周中，Oppo一直在稳步嘲笑中国社交网络微博上的发现N5。查找系列产品经理周Yibao现在<a href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/Pako9ofOQ">共享了突出显示大小的照片</a>，并补充说，使其更薄的障碍现在是“充电端口的极限”。 [...]</p><p>该公司声称发现N5是迄今为止最薄的可折叠。该标题目前由<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235231/honor-magic-v3-thin-foldable-europe-launch">荣誉魔术V3</a>持有，该标题在打开时厚4.35毫米，这意味着发现N5必须接近4mm。这就解释了为什么它看起来大约是8.25mm iPhone 16 Pro Max的一半，并在照片中显示。作为参考，USB-C端口至少为2.6mm。</p></blockquote><p>我看到四个可能的未来：</p><p> （a）我们永远不会看到比4毫米更薄的手机，USB-C将永远与我们同在。</p><p> （b）当我们开始获得比USB-C允许的手机较薄时，它们完全放弃了插入式端口，并专门移动到诱导连接（例如MAGSAFE），以用于充电和数据。</p><p> （c）一家或多家公司（很可能是苹果）设计了一个专有的充电和数据端口，该端口比USB-C更薄。</p><p> （d）USB联盟为USB-C连接器设计了一个行业标准，并且欧盟迅速更新其法规，以允许其作为USB-C的替代方案。</p><p>选项（a）使我保证错误。我们迟早会看到对USB-C端口太薄的手机。唯一的问题是何时。</p><p>选项（b）对于以消费者为目标的设备来说似乎是完全合理的，但是目前，在具有USB-C端口的iPhone Pro模型中启用了从字面上的<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">专业口径视频功能</a>，目前不可能通过任何现有的电感连接器来提供。由于USB无处不在，甚至没有人尝试建立用于高速数据传输的电感连接器。数据传输可能是在不久的将来保留USB-C上专业电话的限制因素，但是最近iPad型号的<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108361">智能连接器</a>处理充电和数据（尽管低速数据传输，但仅用于触控板和键盘输入）。<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">有史以来最薄的iPhone 17“空气”模型</a>预计将<em>与</em>iPhone 17 Pro型号一起使用，而不是<em>代替</em>它们。如果事实证明它很受欢迎，我可以看到不久的将来iPhone“空气”掉落其USB-C端口，并且仅用于收费的MAGSAFE，所有数据传输都会无线进行（这意味着通过蓝牙和Wi-Fi进行了空气） ，虽然iPhone Pro型号，具有较厚的电池和更多更好的相机，但请保留其USB-C端口几年，直到它们也获得感应性充电独家，也许具有突破性的磁性智能连接器，以支持高速数据传输。我怀疑这是我们看到的道路，即提供太微薄的USB-C-C-port手机和平板电脑。而且我相信它将整齐地保留在欧盟的充电港口法规中，但会刺激这些法规的支持者，因为苹果不太可能选择使这样的超智能连接器成为开放标准。 （欧盟USB-C授权仅适用于充电<em>端口的</em>原因，这就是为什么Apple Watch的原因，列举了一个仅通过专有连接器向归纳收费的设备的突出示例，该设备仍在那里可用。）</p><p>当然，选项（c）将在欧盟中不允许，这意味着这些手机要么不会在欧盟出售，要么是使其制造的公司（面对现实，将是苹果）在欧盟出售的模型，该模型省略了专有港口，仅通过MagSafe/Qi收费。我的Spidey-Sense说，这是不值得的，因此不会发生。我可以想象一个端口和连接器比USB-C更薄 - 看起来像闪电，但较薄 - 但是要保持任何形式的结构刚度，它就不会<em>比</em>USB-C更薄，因此不会&#39; t可以创建<em>比</em>USB-C端口允许的薄的手机或平板电脑。我可以想象的是手机和平板电脑，更像是厚度的信用卡。但是，需要解决许多工程挑战才能到达那里 - 电池技术，展示技术，芯片效率，可能还有十几个。</p><p>选项（d）让我笑了，只是想着它。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★薄</title></entry><entry><title>杰西卡·莱辛（Jessica Lessin）2014年的金·沃拉斯（Kim Vorrath） </title><link href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-s-software-taskmaster-faces-tough-test?rc=jfy0lk" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w15" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/lessin-vorrath" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41513</id><published> 2025-01-25T01：27：49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-25T16：50：27z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Sareen Habeshian和Russell Contreras报道了Axios，“<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/24/ice-raid-newark-new-jersey-immigration-us-citizens">市长指责拘留兽医，美国新泽西州移民的美国公民</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>该市市长说，移民和海关执法（ICE）代理商周四突袭了纽瓦克，新泽西州的纽瓦克，并拘留了无证件的移民以及没有逮捕令的美国公民。 [...]</p><p>纽约的Pix11新闻报道，冰分特工进入了海洋食品仓库餐厅，老板路易斯·贾诺塔（Luis Janota）在收到投诉后拘留了三人，大约有十几个移民当局拘留了三人。</p><p> “我问[代理商]他们正在寻找什么文件，他们说这是许可证或护照。我以为，谁带护照走来走去？” Janota告诉车站。贾诺塔（Janota）说，在受到质疑的工人中，这家餐厅的仓库经理是波多黎各人和退伍军人。波多黎各人是美国公民。</p><p> “在我看来，他们是在专门追随某些人 - 不是每种人，因为他们没有要求我提供文件或我的美国工人，葡萄牙工人或白人工人。”</p></blockquote><p>这些突袭正在开始，并且肯定会升级并不奇怪。特朗普大量竞选了大规模驱逐无证移民的承诺。这是他正在做他说的事情的问题。</p><p>但是，这些突袭正在发生<em>的</em>一个明显方面的谈论还不够。在竞选期间，特朗普广泛答应将所有“它们”驱逐出境。即使在十二月，他也告诉NBC新闻的克里斯汀·韦尔克（Kristen Welker）， <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-interview-meet-press-kristen-welker-election-president-rcna182857">在对媒体会议媒体的采访中</a>， <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-aims-deport-all-immigrants-us-illegally-2024-12-08/">他的目标是将<em>所有</em>无证件移民驱逐出美国</a>。</p><p>突袭发生在蓝色州的深蓝色城市。这些地方反对特朗普。纽瓦克的人们没有为此投票。<a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/01/24/chicago-schools-block-immigration-agents/">芝加哥</a>，费城，纽约和波士顿的人们没有为此投票。如果这确实是为了遵循选举特朗普（将无证件移民视为社区祸害的选民的普遍需求）的普遍需求，那么这些突袭不会集中于投票支持特朗普的国家，例如，例如，德克萨斯州和亚利桑那州，哪个实际上在墨西哥接壤？</p><p> <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/10/16/do-conservatives-really-have-an-empathy-deficit-this-is-what-social-science-says/">本质上更加善解人意的</a>自由主义者倾向于关注移民执法的直接人为损失。亚当·塞尔沃（Adam Serwer）2018年《大西洋》（Adam Serwer）的论文（如果有的话）比他写信时更有意义：“<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/">残酷是重点</a>”。 （副总统：“特朗普总统和他的支持者通过对他们讨厌和恐惧的人的苦难感到高兴。”此外，塞尔沃<a href="https://amzn.to/4jyRXr5">（</a> Serwer看着这些突袭的伤心欲绝的麻烦。</p><p>但是，广泛驱逐出境的二阶影响将是经济的。无证件的工人构成了<a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/mobilizing-against-inequality/post/five-ways-undocumented-immigrants-are-powering-american-economy">美国经济的重要部门</a>。大规模驱逐出境的经济影响将是地方，直接影响驱逐出境的社区和城市。首先是对这些移民本身以及他们的家人和朋友的攻击，将这些冰袭击集中在蓝色州的蓝色城市上。但是，正如我所希望的那样，袭击主要或仅在民主国家的民主城市和社区中进行，这实际上是对蓝色国家的经济攻击。</p><p>红色州的特朗普选民将享受电视和社交媒体上突袭的镜头，但这不会是<em>他们的</em>邻居被驱逐出境，而不是<em>他们的</em>承包商，保管人和洗碗机，而这不会是<em>他们的</em>经济遭受经济的社区因此。这在操作上看似不切实际，对于特朗普政府而言，实际上试图将所有无证件移民驱逐出美国的<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/18/politics/border-czar-homan-trump-deportation-plans/index.html">经济上是毁灭性的</a>。<em>实际</em>在操作上是针对大城市的针对性突袭。这些城市将在很大程度上包含有害的经济影响。对蓝色状态来说，这是一个很大的“他妈的你”。</p><p>大选后，我大大改变了媒体饮食，故意选择略读而不是消耗有关政治事务的新闻，这是我对技术行业的利益之外的一般利益，当然，尤其是苹果。几周前，我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag">在Zuckerberg在Meta的Zig-Zag Zig-Zag的专栏中</a>写道：</p><blockquote><p>我对特朗普当选后的看法是，尽我所能停止关注他所说的一切。我只注意他的<em>所作所为</em>。与任何其他国家领导人一起，他们的话语与最终的行动之间存在相关性，这使他们注意他们所说的值得。有了特朗普，几乎没有相关性，而他无休止的令人毛骨悚然的宣言除了分心。</p></blockquote><p>整个<em>帖子</em>都违反了我自己的指南。但是，我希望在这个无证件的移民执法问题上做出一个罕见的例外，因为从双方，这么多的关注都集中在残酷和伤心欲绝上。这确实归结为关注特朗普及其政府<em>所做的</em>事情，不是<em>说</em>。他说，他们是针对所有无证件移民的目标，但到目前为止，他们只是针对那些住在普遍反对它的地方的人。这就是情感和经济成本的地方。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★冰袭击是我们长期摄入的事实上的寒冷内战的升级</title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w11" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：//1.41509</id><published> 2025-01-23T21：25：50Z</published><updated> 2025-01-24T16：12：50Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">带有苹果情报的Siri对体育琐事问题的自信但令人尴尬的错误答案，包括著名的（超级碗）和晦涩难懂（北达科他州高中篮球）。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>From Apple&#39;s developer release notes for iOS 18.3, now at release candidate (RC) status:</p><blockquote><p> For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes">Same for MacOS 15.3</a> Sequoia, which is also at RC status and expected next week.</p><p> I have mixed feelings about this decision. It&#39;s pretty obvious that Apple Intelligence has a slew of shortcomings. It&#39;s the nature of the beast, though, that it&#39;s always going to have some shortcomings. <em>Human</em> intelligence, which to date remains the gold standard for intelligence in general, has some pretty glaring shortcomings, so it&#39;s unsurprising that all artificial intelligence systems still do too. (Perhaps that&#39;s a good metric for defining the next inflection point, now that the Turing Test has been passed: When humans need to ask AI systems to explain their own shortcomings, because we&#39;re no longer smart enough to detect them ourselves.)</p><p> So the bar shouldn&#39;t be “has obvious shortcomings”. It&#39;s whether Apple Intelligence is good enough. Compared to other systems, like ChatGPT, no, it&#39;s not good enough. But Apple has been enabling Siri by default since 2011. And Siri, today, is arguably worse than it&#39;s ever been when compared to the state of the art. A friend just sent me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/siri-or-your-own-lii-ing-eyes.jpeg">this screenshot</a> after asking Siri “Who won Super Bowl 13?” and getting this answer: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. In addition to wrongly casing the Roman numerals, LII is 52, not 13. The only way Siri could have been more wrong would be if the Eagles hadn&#39;t even won Super Bowl 52. I just tried the same question — “Who won Super Bowl 13?” — on both my iPhone running iOS 18.3 RC1 and my Mac running MacOS 15.1.1, and Siri gave me the same wrong answer, on both devices, both when the question was spoken aloud and when it was typed: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. Siri, today, is an unfunny joke.</p><p> But so I think it&#39;s reasonable to ask whether Apple Intelligence is as good as Siri. I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s about how good Apple Intelligence is. In fact, I&#39;d say several of the Apple Intelligence features — Clean Up in Photos, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">notification summaries</a> — are <em>better</em> than Siri. So if Siri has been on by default for over a decade, sure, Apple should go ahead and turn Apple Intelligence on by default too.</p><p> I think there could be significant benefit to turning it on by default, sort of in the spirit of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">dogfooding</a> . Enabling Apple Intelligence features by default will increase the pressure on Apple to keep improving it at a fast clip. It&#39;s also the case that none of Apple Intelligence&#39;s features, with the possible exception of notification summaries, are in the user&#39;s face at all. You have to invoke them to use them. If you don&#39;t want them — or don&#39;t even know about them — you won&#39;t notice anything different once they&#39;re enabled by default. Apple may or may not be <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171226-00/?p=97655">over-indexing</a> on Apple Intelligence, but, thankfully, they&#39;re <em>not</em> shoving it in users&#39; faces.</p><p> But, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">as I wrote two weeks ago</a> , enabling it by default for all users really puts the lie to their claim that all of Apple Intelligence is “beta”. If it&#39;s not just merely shipping to all users, but now enabled by default, that&#39;s not beta. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/beta-is-not-an-excuse-archive">That&#39;s just buggy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Next Week’s iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Updates Will Enable Apple Intelligence During Onboarding’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-macos-153-apple-intelligence-default-onboarding">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0v" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41503</id><published> 2025-01-21T18:17:08Z</published><updated> 2025-01-22T00:59:58Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The order doesn&#39;t change the law; it says to ignore the law.

<p>Bobby Allyn, reporting for NPR, under the dreadfully incorrect headline “ <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268701/trump-executive-order-tiktok-ban">Trump Signs Executive Order to Pause TikTok Ban, Provide Immunity to Tech Firms</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> According to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/application-of-protecting-americans-from-foreign-adversary-controlled-applications-act-to-tiktok/">the order</a> , the law will be paused for 75 days and companies that work with TikTok will not be liable for doing so.</p></blockquote><p> I take profound issue with this framing. The order does not pause the law, because executive orders can&#39;t “pause” laws. The order pauses <em>enforcement</em> of the law. The order itself even says so. Quoting from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/application-of-protecting-americans-from-foreign-adversary-controlled-applications-act-to-tiktok/">the order</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.</p></blockquote><p> Imagine a city council that passes a law banning all motor vehicle traffic on one of the town&#39;s main streets. The law is very unpopular with many people who previously drove on that street. The law went into effect the day before a newly elected mayor takes office. The mayor gets sworn in and he just tells the police chief — who is a political appointee of the mayor — not to enforce the law for 75 days. That&#39;s what Trump has done. He&#39;s just telling the police (the Justice Department) not to enforce the law. Popular demand has no legal bearing.</p><p> This is very much in-character for Donald Trump. This isn&#39;t a rug-pull or about-face on Trump&#39;s part. Give him credit: this is exactly how he said he&#39;d act (or, perhaps, to choose a more provocative verb, <em>rule</em> ) if re-elected. But let&#39;s not mince words or pretend for a moment this is even vaguely normal. The name of the town in my allegory above is Banana Republicville. The order doesn&#39;t change the law; it says to ignore the law.</p><p> And remember: it&#39;s not like PAFACA was a partisan Democratic bill or a Biden initiative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_Americans_from_Foreign_Adversary_Controlled_Applications_Act">PAFACA had broad bipartisan support</a> : it passed in the House of Representatives 360-58, and was agreed to by the Senate 79-18. The two main proponents of the bill in the Senate <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-ricketts-statement-on-tiktok-being-removed-from-app-stores">are Republicans Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts</a> . Cotton is the chairman of the powerful Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Are they just going to sit back and accept this?或许！但也许不是。 It&#39;s going to be a very telling test of Republicans in both houses of Congress. There&#39;s no ambiguity here: Trump is asserting a de facto after-the-fact veto power over a law that was already passed, in direct contravention of the plain language of <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-3-1/ALDE_00001160/">Article II Section 3 of the Constitution</a> .</p><p> Back to Allyn at NPR:</p><blockquote><p> “Essentially with TikTok I have the right to sell it or close it,” Trump said from the Oval Office after signing the executive action on Monday. “We may have to get approval from China.我不知道。 I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll approve.”</p></blockquote><p> Let&#39;s not mince words on this either: this man is a proud ignoramus.

<p>Apple Support document, which is linked from the App Store if you search for any of the apps from ByteDance:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.

Really, all his executive order does is instruct the Justice Department (or as he would call it, <em>his</em> Justice Department) not to enforce the law for 75 days, and to promise any company that violates the PAFACA law that they won&#39;t be prosecuted为此。 There&#39;s really no question about it: Oracle and Akamai are violating the law by providing services to TikTok users in the United States. They&#39;re simply taking Trump at his word that the law will not be enforced and they will not face penalties for violating it during Trump&#39;s completely arbitrary 75-day grace period.</p><p> That&#39;s not like a pardon. Trump&#39;s executive order yesterday carries no more legal weight than a Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” card. I don&#39;t think it will happen but there&#39;s nothing that would stop the Trump Justice Department from changing its mind and prosecuting Oracle and Akamai for these violations. It&#39;s up to Trump. There&#39;s also nothing that would stop a future Justice Department under a post-Trump administration from holding them accountable for this.</p><p> Apple and Google are both sticking with the actual law.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Support: ‘About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Wesley Hilliard, writing for AppleInsider regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">Edits</a> , Meta&#39;s pre-announced mobile-first video editing app:</p><blockquote><p> Despite that, many apps and features on iPhone toe the line between fun tool and social platform. One of those tools was Clips, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/06/apple-launches-new-social-focused-clips-video-editing-app-for-iphone-ipad">arrived in 2017</a> to little fanfare and has been forgotten since.</p><p> Meta and ByteDance have a reason to push their respective video editing apps — brand synergy. More users mean more data, more content, and more ad revenue. Apple, however, doesn&#39;t have the same motivation.</p><p> While Apple would likely love to see users flock to Clips, it would mean entering a race to satisfy a wave of several million customers in an app and interface that was never really more than a proof of concept. It would be a money pit with very little reward as Apple doesn&#39;t have a social platform to drive users to or a way to monetize the app.</p></blockquote><p> I completely agree with Hilliard that the announcement of Edits is the perfect time to mention Clips. I completely disagree with him that Apple has no motivation to dedicate itself to the task of making Clips incredible.</p><p> A mobile-first video editor isn&#39;t a “money pit”. It&#39;s an app. Apple makes a lot of apps, and they could easily afford to assign a team to make Clips truly great. It&#39;s no different than 20–25 years ago, when Apple dedicated itself to making iMovie and Final Cut both great apps. It&#39;s no different than the motivation to create GarageBand. The monetization wouldn&#39;t be direct; it would be downstream of the general idea that if you&#39;re editing videos for social media on your phone, the best app to do it with is from Apple and it&#39;s exclusively available on iPhone. The idea is that Apple doesn&#39;t just make the best computing devices for artists, writers, and creators, but they also make some of the best apps for those fields too.</p><p> There are actually a lot of interesting UI ideas in Clips. But if Apple isn&#39;t interested in making Clips truly great for people who actually love editing videos using their phones, they should just abandon it. Make it great or give up. Keeping it around as an also-ran that no one uses is a bad look. This is the sort of thing Apple should pride itself on: best-of-breed creative tools.</p><p> I don&#39;t know if Edits is a rip-off of CapCut or not, but it&#39;s definitely not a rip-off of Clips. It&#39;s a good rule of thumb that when Apple succeeds at something, it gets ripped off. The better the Apple product, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/22/byford-china-android-forks">the more shamelessly it gets copied</a> . Apple should make Clips into an iOS video editing app that everyone rips off shamelessly.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Remember Clips?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Teases &#39;Edits&#39;, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347358/instagram-edits-capcut-video-app-tiktok-ban" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41499</id><published> 2025-01-21T00:34:09Z</published><updated> 2025-01-21T00:34:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wes Davis, writing at The Verge, under the headline “Instagram Announces a Blatant CapCut Clone”:</p><blockquote><p> Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBIzLAynIQ/">just announced</a> a video editing app called Edits. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFBNqdGSee4?xmt=AQGzCOMan-oc70fxP0uSA3x3sZd58_GJeUpjK1AD4X30tA">Mosseri said</a> the app is meant to rival CapCut, a video editing app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">went offline along with TikTok</a> .

<p>Tim Cook on X:</p><blockquote><p> Dr. King once said, “Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.”真正的伟大在于举起他人，有所作为并有目的地服务。让我们通过寻找服务和共同创造一个更好的世界的方法来尊重他的遗产。</p></blockquote><p> Curious to see if that&#39;s Cook&#39;s only tweet of the day, or if a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">congratulatory one</a> is forthcoming, after Trump&#39;s oath of office at noon. <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1881426564749156537">Here&#39;s the congratulatory tweet</a> , posted at 2:40pm. No exclamation marks this time.</p><p> Apple has been dedicating its homepage to MLK on his holiday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/search/?s=martin+luther+king+jr">for at least 10 years</a> , so <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk">today</a> isn&#39;t some exception just because it&#39;s also Inauguration Day. But it&#39;s perhaps worth pointing out that few among Apple&#39;s corporate peers are doing this. The homepages of (in market cap order), Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla make no mention of either MLK <em>or</em> Trump&#39;s inauguration. Just another day on the calendar for all of them. But I&#39;m not sure any of those companies ever tend to celebrate holidays on their company homepages.</p><p> But the one company that is famous for its holiday “doodles” is Google. And <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025.pdf">Google&#39;s homepage today</a> makes no mention today of MLK, but does direct visitors&#39; attention to their hosted livestream of Trump&#39;s inauguration. Not a doodle, just “🇺🇸 Live! Watch President Trump&#39;s Inauguration”, and nothing about MLK. [ <strong>Update, 2:15 pm:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/google.com-mlk-2025-2.pdf">Google.com now has a nice MLK doodle</a> .

<p>Unsurprisingly, time expired without ByteDance selling TikTok, so the US ban went into effect last night at midnight and (also unsurprisingly) it&#39;s been chaotic and confusing. TikTok was down, but now (as I type this Sunday afternoon) it&#39;s back.有点</p><p>First, the whole thing has become inextricably tied to Donald Trump&#39;s return to the presidency tomorrow. I&#39;m not sure what the thinking was setting the deadline for divestiture one day prior to the 2025 inauguration, but it sure looks like a bad idea in hindsight. Or maybe a good idea?我不知道。 Here&#39;s soon-president Trump, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050">on Truth Social this morning</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark!我将在周一发布一项行政命令，以延长法律禁止生效之前的时间，以便我们可以达成协议来保护我们的国家安全。 The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.</p><p> Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations.</p><p> I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. [ <em>sic</em> ] Without US approval, there is no Tik Tok [ <em>sic</em> ]. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars — maybe trillions.</p><p> Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the US and whichever purchase [ <em>sic?</em> ] we so choose.</p></blockquote><p> The law — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_Americans_from_Foreign_Adversary_Controlled_Applications_Act">The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</a> (PAFACA) — does allow the president to issue a one-time 90-day extension. Trump is saying he intends to do that. I think it&#39;s unclear whether the criteria have been met for such an extension, but let&#39;s just say the extension will happen. It can&#39;t happen until noon tomorrow, because Trump won&#39;t become president again until noon tomorrow, so today the ban is in effect.</p><p> Is Trump talking about the United States federal government buying a 50 percent stake in ByteDance? Or just a US company?谁知道？ The idea of the US government buying a 50 (not 51?) percent stake in a social media company is nutty, quite overtly socialist (perhaps <em>owning the means of distraction</em> is the new <em>owning the means of production</em> ?), but Trump is nutty so who knows what he means here?</p><p> TikTok, upon pulling the plug on service, <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1880833505703407763">at first greeted users with this message</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Important update from TikTok</p><p> We regret that a US law banning TikTok will take effect on January 19 and force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We&#39;re working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible, and we appreciate your support. Please stay tuned.</p></blockquote><p> This was soon replaced by <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1880833505703407763">this patently obsequious</a> “ <em>Help us Obi-Wan Trump, you&#39;re our only hope</em> ” overt pleading:</p><blockquote><p> Sorry, TikTok isn&#39;t available right now</p><p> A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US Unfortunately, that means you can&#39;t use TikTok for now.</p><p>我们幸运的是，特朗普总统表示，他将在上任后与我们合作，以恢复Tiktok的解决方案。请继续关注！</p></blockquote><p> And, now that TikTok has returned to service, they show the following message upon launch, before giving you access to actual content:</p><blockquote><p>欢迎回来！</p><p>感谢您的耐心和支持。 As a result of President Trump&#39;s efforts, TikTok is back in the US!</p><p> You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok.</p></blockquote><p> But all of this is a bit performative. Trump hasn&#39;t done anything yet other than say what he might do tomorrow. PAFACA is still the law, the most Trump can do tomorrow is execute a 90-day reprieve, and most importantly, there remains no sign that the Chinese government has any willingness to sell ByteDance, and no sign that Republicans in Congress are backing down from supporting the ban if China refuses to sell. (Also note that TikTok has been waging a largely successful propaganda campaign to describe the law as a ban on TikTok, not a forced divestiture in which the ban is merely a consequence of non-compliance.)</p><p> Also this morning, I think partly in response to Trump&#39;s blathering, came this: “ <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-ricketts-statement-on-tiktok-being-removed-from-app-stores">Cotton, Ricketts Statement on TikTok Being Removed From App Stores</a> ” (both senators, notably, are Republicans):</p><blockquote><p> Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senator Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska) issued the following statement in response to the news that Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft were among the US companies to remove TikTok from their app stores in accordance with the bipartisan law passed by Congress.</p><p> “We commend Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft for following the law and halting operations with ByteDance and TikTok, and we encourage other companies to do the same.毕竟，该法律可能会对任何违反该公司的公司有毁灭性的破产。 Now that the law has taken effect, there&#39;s no legal basis for any kind of &#39;extension&#39; of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law&#39;s qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.”</p></blockquote><p> Notably, TikTok — at least, again, as I type this — is not available from either Apple&#39;s App Store or Google&#39;s Play Store. Making the app available would clearly violate the law and subject the app store owner to a fine of $5,000 per user; the Cotton-Ricketts statement wasn&#39;t exaggerating that the fines are potentially ruinous. Apple and Google, seemingly, are following the law, not Trump&#39;s good-as-gold word and pinkie-swear promise that they won&#39;t be held liable for violating it. But Oracle and Akamai seemingly are going with Trump&#39;s word. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">The Verge reports</a> :</p><blockquote><p> TikTok&#39;s hosting provider, Oracle, and its CDN partner, Akamai, have restored service and are relying on Trump&#39;s promise, according to NPR&#39;s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bobbyallyn.bsky.social/post/3lg4nit7a522j">Bobby Allyn</a> and The Washington Post&#39;s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lg4k2zfalc2v">Drew Harwell</a> .</p><p> However, the app&#39;s return is happening without support from Apple and Google, as it remains unavailable in the App Store and Google Play. Those companies may still not be comfortable with the risk of breaking the law banning TikTok, which remains in effect and levies steep fines on those who break it.</p><p> Both app stores currently display messages explaining why the app isn&#39;t available if you&#39;re searching for TikTok.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alanrozenshtein.com/post/3lg4ew2l4rc27">University of Minnesota law professor Alan Rozenshtein</a> :</p><blockquote><p> These “service providers” have lost their minds.

Oracle and Akamai are seemingly good with the latter.</p><p> Lastly, it&#39;s worth pointing out that the immediate public clamor is about whether the app works or not, not whether it&#39;s available to download or update in app stores.

But in addition to being a more sensible take legally, Apple and Google&#39;s wait-and-see approach is also under far less pressure from public — and political — opinion.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ BrikTok</title></entry><entry><title> Microsoft Cleans Up Dirty Trick Where Bing Masqueraded as Google — Sort Of </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344207/microsoft-bing-search-results-google-design-change-reversed" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0l" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/bing-cleans-up-dirty-trick" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41493</id><published> 2025-01-18T20:56:29Z</published><updated> 2025-01-20T19:57:04Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Tim Hardwick, last week for MacRumors, “Apple Smart Home Hub Launch Possibly Delayed Until Later in Year”:</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s long-rumoured smart home hub or “command center” may not arrive in the spring as previously expected, according to Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman. [...]</p><p> Apple originally planned to introduce the home hub in March 2025. However, writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5">Power On newsletter</a> , Gurman says that the device “may take longer to reach consumers,” owing to the operating system&#39;s heavy reliance on App Intents features that won&#39;t be ready until iOS 18.4 and iOS 19. This in itself means “it&#39;s plausible that the hardware itself will ship later,” adds Gurman.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5">Here&#39;s Gurman in his own words</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Then there&#39;s the brand-new smart home hub. This device has a roughly 7-inch screen and can help manage household tasks, run apps and conduct video calls. Consumers will be able to hang it on a wall or place it on a countertop — perhaps in a few spots around the home.</p><p> Apple has been planning to introduce the home hub in March, but it may take longer to reach consumers. The device&#39;s new operating system — code-named Pebble — is heavily tied to App Intents features coming in iOS 18.4 and iOS 19, so it&#39;s plausible that the hardware itself will ship a bit later.</p></blockquote><p> How many Apple products that miss “expected” ship dates that were announced only by Gurman do we need before MacRumors writers, and the others on the Gurman <s>regurgitation</s> re-blogging beat, start to wonder whether it&#39;s really the case, as Gurman&#39;s reporting <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/if_a_tree_that_was_never_announced_falls_in_a_forest_does_it_make_a_sound">would have us believe</a> , that every single product from Apple winds up shipping months or even years later than intended?</p><p> Maybe Gurman&#39;s right, and Apple hasn&#39;t shipped a single product on schedule since like maybe <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/01/08/iphone-7-wireless-headphones-beats/">the original AirPods back in 2016</a> (an absolute banger of a scoop, from before Gurman left 9to5Mac for Bloomberg).</p><p> Or, and I&#39;m just tossing this out there, maybe the way companies that are good at shipping new products actually ship new products is by setting aggressive, probably impossible, internal milestones to keep the entire team inside the company and manufacturing partners in the supply chain moving with urgency until the thing is actually ready to announce and ship. And that by reporting these milestones as actual expected ship dates, repeatedly, it makes Mark Gurman and Bloomberg News wrong, not the products late, when those dates are missed without the products ever having been announced. Something like that could happen <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg">when the incentive structure of a news publication is based on whether the reporting moves stock prices</a> , not whether it turns out to be accurate.</p><p> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just the case, though, that Apple has been unable to ship anything new on schedule for close to a decade.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Another Never-Announced Product Might Fail to Meet Its Never-Announced Ship Date’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/another-never-announced-product-might-fail-to-meet-its-never-announced-ship-date">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Joanna Stern&#39;s Imaginary Husband </title><link href="https://techthings.cmail20.com/t/d-e-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-r/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/joanna-sterns-imaginary-husband" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41491</id><published> 2025-01-18T19:36:17Z</published><updated> 2025-01-18T19:36:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>A few days ago Nokia unveiled their Design Archive at Aalto University in Finland. <a href="https://www.fahadx.com/posts/what-was-nokias-reaction-to-the-iphone-announcement-in-2007">Fahad X spotted a real gem</a> — <a href="https://repo.aalto.fi/uncategorized/IO_926740c7-5165-439a-a020-5205aeb4d4d5/">an internal confidential slide deck</a> shared within the company the day after Apple had introduced the original iPhone at Macworld Expo in January 2007. To the credit of the team that put this presentation together, they mostly got it:</p><ul><li><p> “iPhone touch screen UI may set a new standard of state-of-art: The new user interface may change the standards of the superior user experience for the whole market”. They quote <a href="https://www.techsponential.com/">Avi Greengart</a> (a keen and sharp observer): “visually stunning and incredibly responsive”.</p></li><li><p> The on-screen keyboard is mentioned only in passing on a deck titled “Other Great Innovations” as “Predictive, corrective input from on-screen qwerty-keypad”. Most of the existing smartphone makers simply could not believe the iPhone&#39;s touchscreen keyboard would work. Steve Ballmer famously <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/06/ballmer">laughed his way into getting sacked</a> from Microsoft over the iPhone&#39;s price and lack of a hardware keyboard. BlackBerry was obsessed with hardware keyboards. This Nokia deck is remarkably open to the idea that Apple was onto something. It does have a bullet point, under “iPhone has the biggest impact on the definition of coolness” (true!), that states: “Even though Steve Jobs emphasized iPhone superiority to &#39;Buttons&#39;, it is to be expected that the Consumer QWERTY category will continue to succeed.” But still, this deck is remarkable for acknowledging the potential significance of the iPhone&#39;s keyboard.</p></li><li><p> It&#39;s a swing and a miss regarding third party software: “No mention either of Java support, unusual user input method may be the reason. Lack of Java would shut out a big mass of existing SW.” So close to getting it right. The iPhone&#39;s lack of support for the then-“dominant” Java ME (Micro Edition) platform did shut out all existing mobile software. But all of that software sucked, big time. Sucked to develop, sucked to distribute, sucked to install, sucked to use. Not supporting it was a huge win for the iPhone, just like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/04/29/jobs-thoughts-on-flash">not supporting Flash Player</a> wound up being a huge win for both the iPhone in particular and the mobile web generally.</p></li><li><p> It&#39;s weird in hindsight that the deck makes mention of Java mobile apps but the only mention of the web is in passing: “Browsing - Safari web browser – (reportedly most advanced ever) Full screen with touch zoom-in functionality.” This speaks to Nokia&#39;s pre-iPhone mindset that mobile platforms were not really internet-first devices but instead were mostly for running shitty software from carriers (for consumers) or corporate IT departments. The iPhone&#39;s excellent day-one version of Mobile Safari, with support for the “real internet”, not the “baby internet” (to use <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jobs-wants-to-use-iphone-to-put-the-baby-internet-to-bed">Steve Jobs&#39;s own terms</a> ). It&#39;s so easy to get blinded by the way things currently work and to assume they&#39;ll keep working that way.</p></li><li><p> The Nokia team nailed the remarkable and potentially industry-changing nature of Apple&#39;s relationship with Cingular:</p><blockquote><ul><li> Cingular got multi-year exclusivity to iPhone. In exchange <em>it gave up to Apple in many respects</em> :<ul><li> Cingular has allowed Apple to launch a device with WLAN and inbuilt services</li><li> The Yahoo and Google experiences are built in to the Apple phone</li><li> iTunes synch is done in cradle, no OTA</li><li> The multi-year exclusivity of the Cingular — Apple arrangement makes one ask if Apple gets a share of data revenues or Cingular iTunes revenues?</li><li> This may be a start for the whole market to change</li></ul></li><li> iPhone will be sold both in Apple stores and Cingular stores</li><li> This is a marriage of convenience built on mutual distrust and recognition that each has assets the other needs</li></ul></blockquote><p> Nokia concluded, “Other US operators need desperately something against Cingular and Apple” and advised that Nokia should “work very closely especially with T-Mobile.”</p></li></ul><p> The most prescient line in the whole deck was this, recognizing that the iPhone was a UI breakthrough and that the entirety of Nokia&#39;s offerings were far behind:</p><blockquote><p> Nokia needs to develop the touch UI to fight back. S60 should be focus. Maemo platform is critical strength due to openness. Nokia needs a Chief UI architect to re-energize Nokia&#39;s UI innovation across platforms and businesses.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d translate that as the presentation team imploring Nokia&#39;s leadership to recognize that Apple&#39;s primary priority was creating and delivering a great experience, both hardware and software, and Nokia had no such institutional value placed on design quality — on coolness — and would need to reinvent itself to prioritize the same ideals if it was going to compete.</p><p> Upton Sinclair&#39;s famed adage is apt, as ever: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nokia&#39;s Next-Day Internal Competitive Analysis of the Original iPhone Largely Got It Right</title></entry><entry><title> Google搜索现在比男子更多的机器开始需要JavaScript </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/google-begins-requiring-javascript-for-google-search/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/google-search-javascript" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41489</id><published> 2025-01-18T15:52:02Z</published><updated> 2025-01-18T17:58:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Kyle Wiggers, writing at TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> Google says it has begun requiring users to turn on JavaScript, the widely used programming language to make web pages interactive, in order to use Google Search. In an email to TechCrunch, a company spokesperson claimed that the change is intended to “better protect” Google Search against malicious activity, such as bots and spam, and to improve the overall Google Search experience for users. The spokesperson noted that, without JavaScript, many Google Search features won&#39;t work properly and that the quality of search results tends to be degraded.</p><p> The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that, on average, “fewer than .1%” of searches on Google are done by people who disable JavaScript. That&#39;s no small number at Google scale. Google processes around 8.5 billion searches per day, so one can assume that millions of people performing searches through Google aren&#39;t using JavaScript.</p><p> One of Google&#39;s motivations here may be inhibiting third-party tools that give insights into Google Search trends and traffic. <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-blocking-seo-rank-checking-tools-volatility-continues-38759.html">According to a post on Search Engine Roundtable</a> on Friday, a number of “rank-checking” tools — tools that indicate how websites are performing in search engines — began experiencing issues with Google Search around the time Google&#39;s JavaScript requirement came into force.</p></blockquote><p> I long ago stopped being a fan (or regular user) of Google Search, but the SEO industry is worse (to keep the Obi-Wan Kenobi quote references going from my headline, you&#39;ll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than “SEO experts”), so I&#39;m amenable to an argument from Google that this is a justifiable step in their never-ending war with SEO scammers seeking to game search results in their favor.</p><p> But the bottom line is that with this change, Google Search is more of an app than it is a website. A website is a server where you can make requests over the HTTP protocol and get results in HTML format. A server that communicates with clients via executable JavaScript is not a website. Whether it&#39;s a justifiable decision or not, I don&#39;t buy for a second that it&#39;s a <em>necessary</em> decision on Google&#39;s part. Thus I find this decision sad, but given the course Google has been on for the last 15 years or so, I&#39;m also unsurprised. Old original Google was a company <em>of</em> and <em>for</em> the open web. Post 2010-or-so Google is a company that sees the web as a de facto proprietary platform that it owns and controls. Those who experience the web through Google Chrome and Google Search are on that proprietary not-closed-per-se-but-not-really-open web.</p><p> Requiring JavaScript for Google Search is <em>not</em> about the fact that 99.9 percent of humans surfing the web have JavaScript enabled in their browsers. It&#39;s about taking advantage of that fact to tightly control client access to Google Search results. But the nature of the true open web is that the server sticks to the specs for the HTTP protocol and the HTML content format, and clients are free to interpret that as they see fit. Original, novel, clever ways to do things with website output is what made the web so thrilling, fun, useful, and amazing. This JavaScript mandate is Google&#39;s attempt at asserting that it will only serve search results to exactly the client software that it sees fit to serve. That&#39;s Google&#39;s right. But it&#39;s sad.</p><p> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42719865">Here&#39;s a good thread on Hacker News discussing the change</a> , with some interesting commentary on the state of the no-JavaScript web. Also worth pointing out that <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> , the best search engine in the world, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@kagihq/113844641987950222">works fine without JavaScript</a> .</p><p> I&#39;ll end with my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/27/web-without-javascript">longstanding</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/22/navistone-form-data">hot take</a> , which, as the years go on, seems more and more obviously true and no longer a hot take at all: The web would be better off if browsers had never added support for scripting. The web would be <em>much</em> faster; much better for its original purpose of delivering content to consume, not software to interact with; and much more secure and private. More control would remain in the hands of client software — and thus in the hands of users — than server-side.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Search, More Machine Now Than Man, Begins Requiring JavaScript’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/google-search-javascript">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Lumon Takes Grand Central&#39; </title><link href="https://parkerspov.substack.com/p/lumon-takes-grand-central" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/17/lumon-takes-grand-central" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41488</id><published> 2025-01-17T23:06:43Z</published><updated> 2025-01-17T23:22:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Maddy Myers, writing for Polygon:</p><blockquote><p> But the weirdest part of the reveal video, in my opinion, is the implication that the Joy-Cons can be used as a mouse.</p><p> This was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/504149/switch-2-joy-con-mouse">already rumored</a> , and if I hadn&#39;t seen those rumors, then I might not have understood what I was looking at during the portion of the teaser that depicts the Joy-Cons sliding around on a hard surface like a cute lil&#39; mouse 。 Because of those rumors, though, I&#39;m now convinced that this is a thing and the Switch 2 will include this feature. The video specifically shows the Joy-Con mouse position as perpendicular to the surface its on. The new Joy-Con mechanic is further cemented by the part of the video that shows a Joy-Con on its side with a section that really looks like an optical mouse light.

<p>Brian Tallerico, writing for RogerEbert.com:</p><blockquote><p> David Lynch saw my dreams. As a teenager growing up in suburban America in the &#39;80s, “Blue Velvet” and “Twin Peaks” hit like a bolt of lightning. Not only did they capture something about the sinister, surreal underbelly of life under the picket fences, but they said something directly to anyone who thought they could be an artist: You don&#39;t have to do what everyone else is doing.</p><p> Lynch was one of those creative voices who found his own octave, doing for film what people like David Bowie or Prince did for music, shattering expectations of what a piece of art could be. Even when his work missed the mark, which was rare, Lynch was never anything less than a singular artist, a creator who never once succumbed to the desire to please that derails so much potential in his industry. When people point to Lynch works like “ <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mulholland-drive-2001">Mulholland Dr.</a> ” or “ <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-straight-story-1999">The Straight Story</a> ” or even those of us who love “ <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lost-highway-1997">Lost Highway</a> ,” it&#39;s not just that specific film that speaks to them — it&#39;s the sense that the potential of the form is limitless as long as people like Lynch are involved. The entire art form was shifted by him and is now lessened by his absence. We owe it to him to burst through the doors he opened. [...]</p><p> Lynch&#39;s fifth film, 1990&#39;s “Wild at Heart” would be one of his most divisive — it&#39;s often pointed to as Lynch at his most excessive — but it was what he did on television that same year that rocked the entertainment world: “Twin Peaks.透明I could write a book about what “Twin Peaks” meant to a 15-year-old entertainment junkie. To summarize, it exploded the potential of the form. People who watch “Twin Peaks” over three decades later need to understand the TV landscape on which it landed. I&#39;m not saying there wasn&#39;t quality TV in the &#39;80s, but there was less risk-taking than in the 2020s, and watching the saga of Laura Palmer next to formulaic dramas or laugh-track-heavy sitcoms felt like a true shock to the system. For more on “Twin Peaks” and why it mattered, <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/tributes/have-a-great-day-david-lynch-1946-2025">check this out</a> .</p></blockquote><p> A thought that&#39;s been swirling in my head for 30-some years but only today properly crystalized: Lynch is the only artist I love whose work I largely don&#39;t “get”. Nothing exemplifies that more than <em>Twin Peaks</em> — I never stopped thinking that there must be something there that I simply wasn&#39;t getting, but I absolutely loved it. But now I realize that&#39;s a big part of why I loved it. I don&#39;t like to be confused but I do like it when it&#39;s David Lynch confusing me. It&#39;s still hard to believe that show was on commercial network TV.</p><p> Like Kubrick, he was quick to embrace new technology as it became available and to see its artistic potential. He <a href="http://lostmag.matthewbrian.com/issue13/cinematography.php">sung the praises of digital video</a> and declared himself done with film years ahead of the industry. Lynch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4wh_mc8hRE">called bullshit</a> when he saw it, and he always let you know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQiQk8AJ0YI">what he really thought</a> . Also like Kubrick (whom Lynch, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/10/17/lynch">named first when asked his favorite filmmakers</a> ), Lynch&#39;s later years were sparse with new work, but the work he delivered continued to elevate the art form. 2017&#39;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4093826/">18-episode</a> <em><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/twin-peaks-the-return/">Twin Peaks: The Return</a></em> was so utterly Lynchian — a perfect capstone to a remarkable career.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘David Lynch Dies at 78’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/david-lynch-rip">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Bob Uecker, Mr. Baseball, Dies at 90 </title><link href="https://defector.com/bob-uecker-was-just-the-best?giftLink=4e90dd98613fd68a7ca54975700e1c5a" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/bob-uecker-rip" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41482</id><published> 2025-01-17T01:21:27Z</published><updated> 2025-01-17T05:20:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ray Ratto, writing for Defector, gets it right. Bob Uecker was just the best:</p><blockquote><p> He was the face and voice of baseball cinema, the man whose line-reading made “Ju-uuu-st a bit outside” so good that “iconic” doesn&#39;t remotely cover its impact. Even if you&#39;re not a seamhead, you likely came across Bob Uecker and smiled.</p><p> So Thursday&#39;s announcement that Uecker has died at age 90, due to small cell lung cancer, came as a blow. Nine decades is a good long run, but there was never a sense that he was running out of material; Uecker was still a joy to hear on Brewers broadcasts even in Year 54 of being the voice of Wisconsin baseball for two-and-a-half generations. The reaction to his passing was unanimous in the same ways and for the same reasons that the response to Vin Scully&#39;s death was unanimous — it was an outpouring of both sadness at the loss and gratitude for all the time we got to spend with him. In an epochally angry time in America, at a moment when it isn&#39;t hard to find even anti-puppy polemics with a keystroke, Uecker gets a pass from most everyone. Yes he defined baseball, but he also managed to become more than merely Mister Baseball. From the moment of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JXq_tF4skE">his first appearance</a> on Johnny Carson&#39;s definitive version of the Tonight Show, which Uecker earned merely by mastering the tripartite arts of comedy writing, unabashed self-deprecation, and martini-dry humor, he was recognizable as that rarest of Americans, the guy you&#39;d sit back down to listen to even if you were already halfway out the door. Put another way, Norm Macdonald thought he was one of the funniest men he ever met. Beat that with a stick.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/bob-uecker-dies">MLB.com has a fine obituary</a> that includes a slew of links and videos. Uecker, 90 years old, was on the call for the Brewers <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2025/01/bob-uecker-final-brewers-call-death-mets">right up until the bitter end of last season</a> , when they fell to the Mets in the 9th inning. <a href="https://twitter.com/nut_history/status/1879927785306919028">His final words as a broadcaster</a> : “I&#39;m telling you. That one — had some sting on it.”这也是如此。</p><p> If you want to lose a few hours in laughter, head down the rabbit hole of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=johnny+carson+bob+uecker">Uecker&#39;s 100-some appearances on Carson</a> . Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2ukxCErDkk">the first one</a> that just came up for me now, a 1976 appearance where Uecker, utterly deadpan as ever, makes Mel Brooks spit out his coffee.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Bob Uecker, Mr. Baseball, Dies at 90’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/bob-uecker-rip">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Nintendo Drops Switch 2拖车</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w09" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-trailer" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41481</id><published> 2025-01-16T16:14:33Z</published><updated> 2025-01-16T16:14:47Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Fun trailer and a smart <em>if-it-ain&#39;t-broke-don&#39;t-fix-it</em> design. Switch 2 just looks like a slightly bigger Switch. Pure joy.</p><p> That it&#39;s just a bigger faster Switch is proof of the genius of the Switch form factor, which has now been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/">widely</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-steam-deck-alternatives">copied</a> across the industry. The Switch is to handheld + dockable console gaming what the iPhone is to phones. They&#39;re announcing compatibility with existing Switch games, including physical game cards, but with a footnote disclaiming “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.” I suspect all major games will be fully compatible but some of the half-assed dreck available on the online Switch store might not be.</p><p> It&#39;s nothing short of glorious that, thanks to the Switch, Nintendo is thriving. Just about everything currently on my plate and on my mind to write about is some combination of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/rory-sykes">tragic</a> , <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-makeup-photo-liv-gold-bedminster-1728985">ugly</a> , <a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-deletes-trans-and-nonbinary-messenger-themes/">hateful</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/smith-special-counsel-report-vol-1">worrisome</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/breakfast-with-pete-hegseth">more worrisome</a> , <a href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-meta-european-union-digital-markets-act-e759c245ae163efbd1bb06b1cb3cb147">spiteful</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">corrupt</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/11/google-donates-to-trump-inauguration-racket">more corrupt</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/noah-smith-tiktok-china">contentious</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/bezos+washington+post">depressing</a> , or, <em>at best</em> , just plain <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113827178760428345">no fun at全部</a>。 But here&#39;s Nintendo — perhaps the most humane company in the history of computing, and one that has never allowed either success or failure to distract it from its core mission of creating wholesome, clever, exquisitely well-designed fun games — with a much-anticipated announcement of something new that is purely about adding more joy to people&#39;s lives.</p><p> As Mario would say, “Woohoo!”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Nintendo Drops Switch 2 Trailer’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-trailer">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Twenty Years of Kraft&#39; </title><link href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/dispatches/twenty-years-of-kraft" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w08" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/twenty-years-of-kraft" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41480</id><published> 2025-01-15T22:09:49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-15T23:03:53Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Bryan Bedell, on the Field Notes Dispatches blog:</p><blockquote><p> The anniversary date of “Field Notes” varies a bit, depending on who you ask. Aaron Draplin first used the name (typeset, of course, in all-caps Futura Bold) on a customized one-off <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/field-notes-prod/images/FN1C.jpg">red hardcover notebook</a> in 2002. Our “official line” sets the birth of the company in mid-2007, when Coudal Partners and Aaron first printed a batch of 3-Packs for the “Swap Meat,” followed shortly by the establishment of “Field Notes Brand” as an actual thing.</p><p> But a good case can be made that the very first Field Notes were made in “early January 2005,” making this, January 2025, an important 20th anniversary. This was the first “big” run (200 books, big for the time!), hand-printed by Aaron on his desktop Gocco silkscreen rig.* This was the first use of a kraft-paper cover. The general look-and-feel, while a bit narrower, is mostly dialed-in. The body is graph paper, even if it&#39;s trimmed-down letter-size dungeon-mapping blue-ruled graph paper.</p></blockquote><p> I carry a Field Notes (or at least Field-Notes-sized — I dally with others, but always come home) notebook in my back pocket wherever I go. And because I&#39;m a pack rat, I number, date, and keep them all. I just filled up <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/field-notes-114.jpeg">volume 114</a> (9 Dec 2024 – 13 Jan 2025) and started volume 115 yesterday.</p><p> Funny enough, I started my pocket notebook habit in 2006, a year before Field Notes became a thing. And I was greatly dissatisfied with the various notebooks I&#39;d tried prior to Field Notes. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/moleskine-hard-004.jpeg">Hardcover Moleskines</a> were too thick and uncomfortable to sit on, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/moleskine-soft-001.jpeg">their softcover notebooks</a> started falling apart at the seams after just a few weeks. And then in 2007 my friend Jim Coudal offhandedly mentioned that he was starting a project with Aaron Draplin called Field Notes, and son of a bitch if the notebooks they were making weren&#39;t <em>exactly</em> what I craved. The rest is history — a lot of ink, a lot of pages. Mostly nonsense, but some occasional gems and fond memories. The first page of my first notebook has a list of strollers to consider for my then-toddler son; he&#39;s now a junior in college. And flipping through volume 4 just now, I came upon <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/moleskine-hard-004-brushed-metal-itunes-7.jpeg">this one-page outline from September 2006</a> for a never-published episode in the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2005/09/anthropomorphized">Anthropomorphized</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/01/brushed_metal">Brushed</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/06/brushed_metal_leopard">Metal</a> Interface Theme saga, wherein Brushed Metal, Aqua, and the just-released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/11/itunes-through-the-ages/">iTunes 7</a> visit a bitter classic Mac OS 9 Platinum theme on his deathbed in the hospital.

<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> Ahead of the season two premiere of hit TV show Severance, Apple is marketing the show with a fun Severance pop-up at the Grand Central Terminal in New York City.</p><p> Apple has assembled a glass cube with workstations that are identical to the setups that Lumon employees use on the show, complete with employees “working,” doing yoga, playing catch, throwing paper airplanes, sipping coffee, and performing other activities that we&#39;ve seen on Severance.</p><p> At 4:30 pm Eastern Time, Severance director Ben Stiller made an appearance at the site, with some of the show&#39;s actors visiting as well. Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Patricia Arquette, Britt Lower, and Tramell Tillman were on hand and spent time in the makeshift office space, with the actors in character as their “innies.”</p></blockquote><p> Super fun idea. Season 2 debuts Friday.</p><p> My wife and I watched season 1 when it debuted three years ago, and we both really liked it. I&#39;m more of a sci-fi fan than she is. I often enjoy shows where the clever premise itself is the main appeal; she doesn&#39;t. But while <em>Severance</em> definitely has a clever fundamental premise, it&#39;s really not the main appeal of the show. It&#39;s fundamentally an ensemble character-driven mystery. Such a great cast, all of them playing intriguing, interesting characters. And the direction — especially the five episodes directed by Ben Stiller — is phenomenal. Terrific cinema.</p><p> Anyway, when season 1 completed in 2022, my wife and I instantly agreed we&#39;d re-watch before season 2. We started that re-watch just after New Year&#39;s, and holy hell was I reminded how much I don&#39;t just like but <em>love</em> this show. If they sustain the same quality for multiple seasons, <em>Severance</em> will wind up in my count-on-one-hand list of favorite shows ever made.就是这样。</p><p> One true test of a great series is that it&#39;s <em>better</em> on the second watch through. That was true in spades for <em>Severance</em> season 1 — knowing some of the answers from the first watch made it all the more enriching. The first time through, you&#39;re in the dark as much as the protagonists are. The second time through, you know things they don&#39;t know, and that knowledge serves as a jolt of sustained suspense. It&#39;s brilliant storytelling.</p><p> My second test of a great series is whether, when I consider who is my favorite character, I not only have a hard time answering, but I have a hard time even eliminating characters from consideration. Multiple great lead characters, and multiple supporting characters who are so interesting I find myself wishing they had bigger roles.</p><p> (The only three series I&#39;ve watched in their entirety <em>more</em> than twice: <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em> , <em>The Sopranos</em> , and <em>Mad Men</em> . All three of those shows pass both my tests with flying colors.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Pulled a Fun In-Character Promo Stunt for ‘Severance’ Yesterday at Grand Central Terminal’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/severence-grand-central">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;TikTok Is Just the Beginning&#39; </title><link href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/tiktok-is-just-the-beginning" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w05" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/noah-smith-tiktok-china" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41477</id><published> 2025-01-15T19:45:48Z</published><updated> 2025-01-15T19:45:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Noah Smith, writing at Noahpinion:</p><blockquote><p> As many observers have noted, this tells us two important things. First, it tells us that Chinese officials are the ones calling the shots with regards to TikTok. This should be no surprise, given that ByteDance is <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/experts-agree-byte-dance-is-beholden-to-the-ccp-and-cannot-be-allowed-to-exploit-americans-data">legally required</a> to obey CCP directives.</p><p> Second, the refusal to sell the app tells us that the Chinese government would rather see TikTok destroyed than see it fall into American hands. Notably, that same government <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168079/grindr-sold-chinese-owner-us-cfius-security-concerns-kunlun-lgbtq">put up little fuss</a> back in 2020 when the US forced a Chinese company to sell the gay dating app Grindr to an American company. Why shut down TikTok and leave untold billions of dollars on the table, instead of just selling the thing like Grindr was sold?</p><p> One possibility is that it&#39;s an attempt to make young Americans angry, in the hopes that they&#39;ll demand that Trump and Congress repeal the 2024 law. But a simpler explanation is that Chinese leaders simply think that TikTok, unlike other apps, is so important that they would rather destroy it than see it escape their control.</p></blockquote><p> TikTok is an ingenious propaganda platform. A mass audience — which skews very young — finds it addictively entertaining. But research studies show that the platform squelches topics that aren&#39;t aligned with the CCP. Smith cites two; here&#39;s the abstract<a href="https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/Peer-Reviewed-Paper-in-Press_Dec.-2024.pdf">of the second one</a> , which was published just last month:</p><blockquote><p> Three studies explored how TikTok, a China-owned social media platform, may be manipulated to conceal content critical of China while amplifying narratives that align with Chinese Communist Party objectives. Study I employed a user journey methodology, wherein newly created accounts on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube were used to assess the nature and prevalence of content related to sensitive Chinese Communist Party (CCP) issues, specifically Tibet, Tiananmen Square, Uyghur rights, and新疆。 The results revealed that content critical of China was made far less available than it was on Instagram and YouTube.</p><p> Study II, an extension of Study I, investigated whether the prevalence of content that is pro- and anti-CCP on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube aligned with user engagement metrics (likes and comments), which social media platforms typically use to amplify content 。 The results revealed a disproportionately high ratio of pro-CCP to anti-CCP content on TikTok, despite users engaging significantly more with anti-CCP content, suggesting propagandistic manipulation.</p><p> Study III involved a survey administered to 1214 Americans that assessed their time spent on social media platforms and their perceptions of China. Results indicated that TikTok users, particularly heavy users, exhibited significantly more positive attitudes towards China&#39;s human rights record and expressed greater favorability towards China as a travel destination.</p></blockquote><p> Back to Smith:</p><blockquote><p> In other words, the Chinese government is <em>actively silencing the views of Americans</em> who try to criticize that government. Somehow I doubt that the First Amendment&#39;s protection of free speech <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/tiktok-bill-foreign-influence/677806/">was intended to protect</a> the right of foreign governments to silence American individuals from speaking their mind in popular public forums. That would be a very strange definition of “freedom of speech”. Of course, I am no legal scholar, so I&#39;ll have to wait on the Supreme Court to make that judgement, and abide by what they decide.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘TikTok Is Just the Beginning’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/noah-smith-tiktok-china">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>与皮特·赫格斯（Pete Hegseth）早餐</title><link href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-pressure-campaign-to-get-pete-hegseth-confirmed-as-defense-secretary" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w04" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/breakfast-with-pete-hegseth" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41476</id><published> 2025-01-15T01:00:46Z</published><updated> 2025-01-16T04:10:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/wingfield-sonos">Speaking of</a> new (“interim”) Sonos CEO Tom Conrad and Scott Forstall, here&#39;s an interesting anecdote from Tyler Hayes&#39;s terrific piece for Motherboard in 2021, “ <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-pandora-won-its-royalty-battle-but-lost-the-war-to-spotify/">How Pandora Won Its Royalty Battle but Lost the War to Spotify</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> After pushback on only allowing web apps for the iPhone, Steve Jobs announced that native apps would be coming to the iPhone. In the interim, Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall invited Tim Westergren and his CTO, Tom Conrad, over to a local Cupertino lunch spot. The trio talked for hours about what Pandora had learned about streaming audio from putting apps on flip phones, like Motorola&#39;s RAZR, for wireless carriers. The meeting ended with a question for Forstall.</p><p> “What, if anything, can we do at Pandora to get ready for the next generation of iPhone that includes an app store and native APIs?” asked Conrad. “Forstall said, it wouldn&#39;t be a waste of your time to jailbreak some iPhones and use the kind of back door toolkits that were being distributed by other people to build a native Pandora app while we get our act together at Apple on something more正式的。”</p><p> So, Conrad, designer Dan Lythcott-Haines, and many others on the team got to work jailbreaking iPhones and working on a Pandora iPhone app ahead of the official APK release. Then, on day one of the App Store launch, Pandora was the first internet radio app available. Nine months later the Pandora app was installed on 21 percent of iPhones.</p></blockquote><p> I first linked to this article <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/09/forstall-pandora">back in 2021</a> , when it was published, but it seemed perfect for a re-link now in light of Conrad&#39;s new role at Sonos.

<p>Sonos interim CEO Tom Conrad, in a company-wide memo obtained by The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> With my stepping in as CEO, the Board, Max, and I have agreed that my background makes the Chief Product Officer role redundant.

<p>Nick Wingfield, writing today&#39;s The Briefing column for the paywalled (alas) The Information:</p><blockquote><p> Sonos has always been a bit of an odd duck. There aren&#39;t that many consumer electronics startups of its size created in the last quarter century (Sonos was founded in 2002) that have survived as independent companies. Its products are expensive relative to the wireless speakers that have flooded the market from big-name tech rivals like Amazon and no-name competitors from China. And yet, Sonos held on partly because it had a commitment to high-quality sound and an Apple-like dedication to user experience, both of which gave it a passionate fan base.</p><p> The events of the last year seem to have ruptured that relationship with many of its customers. Today, Spence&#39;s replacement — Tom Conrad, a Sonos board member, who is now interim CEO — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342354/sonos-interim-ceo-tom-conrad-employee-letter">reportedly told staff</a> he&#39;s focused on repairing those relations. If he&#39;s unsuccessful, it&#39;s fair to wonder whether Sonos — whose market capitalization is around $1.7 billion — might be better off selling itself to a bigger rival like Amazon, Google or Apple.</p><p> Years ago, a former senior Apple executive told me he once begged Steve Jobs, who was then Apple&#39;s CEO, to buy Sonos. Jobs wasn&#39;t interested. A lot has changed since then, but the Sonos brand still might have enough cachet to interest a more powerful suitor.</p></blockquote><p> A tidbit like that immediately set my mind racing as to who that “former senior Apple executive” was. It took me only a few seconds to make my guess: Scott Forstall. There are a few other senior Apple executives who I can imagine might have pushed Jobs to pursue an acquisition of Sonos, but none of them are “former”. They&#39;re all still at Apple.</p><p> The only other possibility I can think of is Tony Fadell, but Fadell is a hardware guy and a builder by nature. He even titled his book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/4agE2S4">Build</a></em> . I think he&#39;d have wanted to spearhead the creation of Apple&#39;s own lineup of Sonos-like audio kit under the iPod brand, not acquire them. But Fadell is a maybe.</p><p> No one else really fits the bill. Bob Mansfeld? Bertrand Serlet?不。 Jony Ive? Doesn&#39;t sound right. Jon Rubinstein? He left Apple in April 2006, which I think predates Wingfield&#39;s time covering Apple for The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Well, my first guess was wrong, but my second was right. I asked Tony Fadell and he confirmed to me it was him, saying it was back in the very earliest days of Sonos, <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/how-it-started">when Sonos was set to debut</a> with a device featuring an obviously iPod-like scroll wheel for input. Jobs wanted to sue (of course). But Fadell, after meeting with the founders, wanted to buy them, and made his case to Jobs, to no avail, several times circa 2003. Fadell said his pitch was basically “Seriously, we are all about music. Customers want this. I want this.” And Jobs&#39;s response was, according to Fadell, “No one wants what they are selling.”</p><p> (Here in 2025, there are an awful lot of Apple users who also own an awful lot of Sonos devices who would disagree with Jobs on that.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Nick Wingfield on Sonos as an Acquisition Target (and a Juicy Tidbit Regarding a Former Apple Exec Who Wanted to Acquire Them)’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/wingfield-sonos">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;47 Years Later, the Palisades Disappeared Overnight&#39; </title><link href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2025/01/47-years-later-the-palisades-disappeared-overnight" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w00" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/47-years-later-the-palisades-disappeared-overnight" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41472</id><published> 2025-01-14T18:18:31Z</published><updated> 2025-01-14T18:18:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mike Davidson:</p><blockquote><p> I grew up on Iliff Street, right in the middle of the ashes that up until a few nights ago, was a sunkissed neighborhood known as Pacific Palisades.</p><p> It was 1978, and I remember my dad climbing up on our roof with a garden hose. Every couple of hours, he would wet the house down, top-to-bottom, and everything surrounding it. I don&#39;t remember everybody doing this, but my Dad is a Meteorologist, and back then he worked at the <a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/">SCAQMD</a> , the regional agency charged with studying, regulating, and improving air quality in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Because of his specific remit and where we lived, he had a deep understanding of the Santa Ana winds and their effect on the Palisades.</p><p> When my dad explained what he was doing, he would point northeast to the hills behind us and tell us that if the winds didn&#39;t die down, the fire miles in the distance would come towards our tiny little house and there would be trouble. As a small child, I don&#39;t actually remember being scared about any of this.

<p>Alan Feuer and Charlie Savage, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted President-elect Donald J. Trump on charges of illegally seeking to cling to power after losing the 2020 election, said in a final report released early Tuesday that the evidence would have been sufficient to convict Mr. Trump in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made it impossible for the prosecution to continue.</p><p> “The department&#39;s view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a president is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government&#39;s proof or the merits of the prosecution, which the office stands fully behind,” Mr. Smith wrote.</p><p> He continued: “Indeed, but for Mr. Trump&#39;s election and imminent return to the presidency, the office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.”</p></blockquote><p> The Times includes a link to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/14/us/report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025.html">the full 174-page first volume of the report</a> . Without having read it yet, I&#39;ll just say this. It should go without saying that Trump&#39;s actions are Trump&#39;s responsibility. Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/10/nyregion/trump-hush-money-sentencing">the already convicted</a> felon of far lesser crimes, and he should have been (and perhaps, years from now, will be) the convicted felon of the grave crimes against the nation itself that Jack Smith&#39;s special counsel team investigated and charged him with.</p><p> But Joe Biden deserves blame for the fact that Trump wasn&#39;t tried before the 2024 election. I take no pleasure in saying it because I like Biden, a lot, and in most other ways I agreed with his policies <em>and</em> his numerous accomplishments over the last four years. But with regard to Donald Trump, Biden just fucking blew it.这很简单。 Biden wrongly believed that after the 2020 election, and exacerbated by Trump&#39;s embarrassing refusal to accept defeat and his ham-fisted attempt at a coup-by-morons on January 6, that Trump was finished, politically. Like Nixon after Watergate, but with even deeper ignominy. Biden thought his own election was proof that the MAGA fever had broken, and the American electorate had returned to some sort of pre-Trump “normalcy”. So Biden appointed Merrick Garland, a feckless cowardly fool, as Attorney General, and under Biden and Garland&#39;s direction the Justice Department slow-walked the pursuit of justice against Trump for his crimes, thinking it would be better for the nation — a nation, again, that Biden plainly but wrongly assumed was ready to put Donald Trump in the ash heap of history — not to aggressively prosecute Trump as though time was of the essence, so as to remove any possible appearance that they were pursuing his prosecution for political reasons.</p><p> What a grave mistake. I hope it winds up not mattering much in the grand scheme of history, but there&#39;s a pit in my stomach telling me it will. Jack Smith wasn&#39;t appointed Special Prosecutor by Garland <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/1553901/dl?inline">until 18 November 2022</a> . Smith was the right man for the job, but he should have been appointed at the very start of the Biden administration in early 2021. That year and a half of abject dithering was the difference between putting Trump on trial and convicting him of the crimes we literally watched him commit on TV, and seeing Trump run out the clock with procedural delays until he had the chance to be reelected, which he was. And now here we are on the cusp of Trump serving a second term in the White House without ever standing trial for his serious crimes against the nation. The urgency was dire, but Biden and Garland acted as though they had all the time in the world, until they realized their mistake far too late.</p><p> If Trump 2.0 goes mostly like Trump 1.0 — a daily stream of chaotic talk, but very little chaotic action to speak of, leaving an electorate to quickly tire of his antics and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/us/elections/calendar-primary-results.html">turn against him in the midterms</a> two years hence — the dark mark on Biden&#39;s historical legacy will likely be his stubborn refusal (and/or cognitive inability) to recognize that age had caught up to him, leading him to run for a reelection and drop out only after embarrassing himself in a debate, leaving Democrats no time to hold a proper primary election to choose a popularly-elected candidate for 2024. But if Trump 2.0 is unlike Trump 1.0, and is filled with actions that leave a lasting mark on the nation and the world, history will remember Biden for allowing Trump to get off the hook for obvious crimes against democracy itself.</p><p> Biden is like the protagonist in a horror movie who defeats the villain but doesn&#39;t finish him off, congratulates himself, and turns his back on his foe and starts walking off into the sunset. All the while, with the audience screaming, “Finish him off! He&#39;s getting back up!回转！ Oh god, I can&#39;t watch...”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Volume 1 of Jack Smith’s Special Counsel Report Flatly States Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/smith-special-counsel-report-vol-1">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Bananas Bloomberg Report: &#39;China Weighs Sale of TikTok&#39;s US Operations to Elon Musk&#39; </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-musk-as-one-possible-option" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vzy" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/bloomberg-china-tiktok" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41470</id><published> 2025-01-14T03:53:46Z</published><updated> 2025-01-14T04:07:03Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Chris Welch, The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is resigning from the job today, effective immediately, with board member Tom Conrad filling the role of interim CEO. It&#39;s the most dramatic development yet in an eight-month saga that has proven to be the most challenging time in Sonos&#39; history.</p><p> The company&#39;s decision to prematurely release a buggy, completely overhauled new app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137502/sonos-new-app-announced">back in May</a> — with crucial features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151704/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-missing-features">missing at launch</a> — outraged customers and kicked off a monthslong domino effect that included <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220357/sonos-layoffs-august-2024-app">layoffs</a> , a sharp decline in employee morale, and a public apology tour. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24169086/sonos-ace-headphones-review">Sonos Ace headphones</a> , rumored to be the whole reason behind the hurried app, were immediately overshadowed by the controversy, and my sources tell me that sales numbers remain dismal. Sonos&#39; community forums and subreddit have been dominated by complaints and an overwhelmingly negative sentiment since the spring. [...]</p><p> But three months later, Sonos&#39; board of directors and Spence have concluded that those steps weren&#39;t enough: the app debacle has officially cost Spence his job. No other changes are being made today, however. So for now, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, who some employees have privately told me deserves a fair share of the blame for recent missteps, will remain in his role.</p></blockquote><p> If they don&#39;t fire that rube too, Sonos is likely continuing down the path to irrelevance and bankruptcy that Spence started them down. The problem wasn&#39;t a bad or ill-considered app rewrite. The bad app rewrite was a symptom of leadership with no appreciation for product and experience design, when Sonos&#39;s entire <em>raison d&#39;être</em> is to deliver a superior product and acoustic experience. Their customer demographic is people with great taste and high standards. Sonos is basically Apple, but just for audio, but in a market where Apple itself is a major player. Yet somehow the company wound up being run by a leadership team with no taste.</p><p> Here&#39;s a surprise tidbit that gives me hope Conrad might be the right man for the job:</p><blockquote><p> Conrad&#39;s career includes a 10-year tenure as chief technology officer at Pandora and two years as VP of product at Snapchat. He worked on Apple&#39;s Finder software during the &#39;90s. Most recently, Conrad served as chief product officer for the ill-fated Quibi streaming service.</p></blockquote><p> (To be clear, I&#39;m talking about the &#39;90s Finder part, not the Quibi part. The classic Finder was one of the all-time best apps ever made.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Sonos Canned CEO Patrick Spence, Who Spearheaded Disastrous App Launch’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/sonos-canned-ceo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Mastodon将其所有权转移到新的非营利组织</title><link href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/01/the-people-should-own-the-town-square/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/vzv" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/mastodon-non-profit-ownership" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41467</id><published> 2025-01-13T23:07:39Z</published><updated> 2025-01-13T23:15:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
