<p>Mark Gurman 为彭博社报道，“ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google">苹果测试‘Apple GPT’，开发生成式 AI 工具以赶上 OpenAI</a> ”：</p><blockquote><p>据知情人士透露，这家 iPhone 制造商已经建立了自己的框架来创建大型语言模型——基于人工智能的系统是 ChatGPT 和谷歌 Bard 等新产品的核心。借助这个被称为“Ajax”的基础，Apple 还创建了一项聊天机器人服务，一些工程师将其称为“Apple GPT”。</p><p>知情人士表示，近几个月来，人工智能的推动已成为苹果公司的一项主要工作，多个团队在该项目上进行了合作。由于此事属于私人性质，因此要求不具名。这项工作包括尝试解决与该技术相关的潜在隐私问题。</p></blockquote><p>苹果正在进行这样的项目并不奇怪。如果他们不这样做的话，那就太令人震惊了。苹果在推出具有人工智能聊天机器人功能的软件方面起步较晚，这并不奇怪。苹果很少是第一个采用新技术的人，尤其是那些涉及人工智能聊天隐私问题的技术。</p><p>我在 WWDC 之前就已经敲响了这个鼓，但 Xcode 是一个<em>需要</em>这种功能的应用程序。 Xcode 是我所知道的唯一不提供 AI 代码生成和分析的主要开发人员 IDE。我看过一些使用<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft VS Code 的</a>读者提供的演示，它们非常棒。</p><p>下一段：</p><blockquote><p>彭博社周三报道了人工智能方面的努力后，苹果股价上涨 2.3%，至 198.23 美元的历史新高，从早前的跌势中反弹。 OpenAI 的合作伙伴和主要支持者微软公司受此消息影响股价下跌约 1%。</p></blockquote><p>如果你注意到的话，彭博新闻报道<em>总是</em>包含这样的更新。这是彭博社独有的痴迷。我的理解是，<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-reporters-compensation-2013-12">这个长达十年之久的《商业内幕》故事仍然是真实的</a>：彭博社记者接受评估并获得与报道市场动态新闻相关的奖金。他们在经济上受到激励，小题大作，小题大做，以最大限度地提高他们的报告对股价的直接影响。彭博社将这些股票价格走势附加在他们的报告中，以加深人们对彭博社发布影响市场走势的新闻的认识，因此也许您也应该每月在<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/">彭博终端</a>上花费超过 2,000 美元，这样您就可以在公众面前几分钟之前收到来自彭博社的新闻报道，并根据该新闻买入、卖出和做空股票。据我所知，没有其他新闻机构拥有这样的记者激励制度，但没有其他新闻机构拥有像彭博终端这样的业务。</p><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bloomberg-aapl-2023-07-19.png">这是今天苹果股价的图表</a>。古尔曼的报告于中午 12:03 发布，随后，苹果公司的股价在中午 12:04 准时暴涨。然后，它基本上又回到了原来的状态，大概是在每个人都意识到除了苹果正在开发我们都认为他们正在开发的东西这一事实之外，这里实际上没有任何新闻之后。苹果公司股价当天上涨 0.7%。</p><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bloomberg-msft-2023-07-19.png">微软今天的股价图表</a>并没有像苹果公司那样出现大幅下跌，但在 12:01 时该股的交易价格为 359.35 美元，并在 12:04 正好跌至 356.84 美元，即古尔曼的报告传到彭博终端后一分钟。 “<em>这对微软来说是个坏消息</em>”的思路大概是，如果 OpenAI 在 LLM AI 技术方面拥有长期护城河，微软很可能会收购它们，或者以其他方式维持其独家合作伙伴的地位，而苹果最终可能需要花大价钱来获得 OpenAI/微软技术的许可。但<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">如果没有护城河</a>，甚至苹果也在开发自己的 LLM 系统，那么从长远来看，微软与 OpenAI 的合作可能没有多大价值。</p><p>苹果在中午 12:04 短暂上涨 2.7%，而微软则出现较小但仍显着的下跌，这显然是由古尔曼的报告造成的。彭博终端订阅者先于其他人收到此类报告。 （当然，彭博社的员工在发布<em>之前</em>就知道这些信息，但我确信永远不会用它做任何不正当的事情。）一旦你通过这个棱镜查看彭博社的原始报告——他们的大部分原始报告都是为了改变他们所报告的公司的股价，目的是向<sup id="fnr1-2023-07-19-B"><a href="#fn1-2023-07-19">日间</a></sup>交易的赌徒证明彭博终端的高额订阅费的价值——他们的许多看似莫名其妙的风格怪癖似乎并不那么重要。无法再解释了。他们只是看起来有点恶心。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-07-19-B"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal">根据维基百科的说法</a>，“彭博终端的年费约为每位用户 2.4 万美元，对于仅使用一台终端的订户来说，每年费用为 2.7 万美元。截至 2022 年，全球有 325,000 名彭博终端用户。”每年的收入约为 80 亿美元。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-07-19-B"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 当然，苹果公司正在开发一个 LLM 人工智能聊天机器人，当然，彭博社报道披露其代号时提到了这个故事如何影响了公司的股价</title></entry><entry><title>Unity 推出 VisionOS 测试版计划</title><link href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230719202814/en/Unity-Launches-Beta-Program-for-visionOS-%E2%80%94-Enabling-Unity-Developers-to-Create-Games-and-Apps-for-Apple-Vision-Pro" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxs" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/19/unity-visionos-beta" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40096</id><published> 2023-07-19T22:07:14Z</published><updated> 2023-07-20T00:03:10Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><em>第 1 条：</em> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/products?source=plans">Dropbox</a>仍然是一项出色的服务，看起来完全可靠，价格也公平。</p><p><em>第 2 项：</em> Dropbox 的官方 Mac 客户端多年来一直是一个令人困惑、丑陋、资源密集的混乱，而且只会变得更糟。</p><p><em>第 3 项：</em> <a href="https://maestral.app/">Maestral</a>是一款适用于 MacOS 和 Linux 的开源 Dropbox 客户端，由 Sam Schott 开发。它提供了我想要的 Mac Dropbox 客户端功能，以及很久<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/06/13/dropbox-sucks">以前官方 Dropbox 应用程序的功能</a>：一个同步文件夹，具有位于菜单栏应用程序中的最小用户界面。它<a href="https://maestral.app/about/">使用的内存比 Dropbox 的官方客户端少得多</a>，并且提供了更简单的界面。</p><p>去年八月，我从 Dropbox 的官方 Mac 客户端切换到 Maestral。总的来说，我对这次搬家感到非常满意。但 Maestral 并不适合所有人。<a href="https://maestral.app/about/">来自 Maestral 网站的“限制”下</a>：</p><blockquote><p>目前，Maestral 不支持 Dropbox Paper、Dropbox 团队的管理以及共享文件夹设置的管理。如果您需要任何此功能，请使用 Dropbox 网站或官方客户端。</p><p> Maestral 使用公共 Dropbox API，与官方客户端不同，它不支持仅传输文件中已更改的部分（“二进制差异”）。因此，Maestral 可能会使用比官方客户端更多的带宽。但是，如果本地或云中已存在具有相同内容的文件，它将避免上传或下载该文件。</p></blockquote><p>我不使用 Dropbox Paper，没有 Dropbox“团队”，而且我可以访问 Dropbox 网站来管理共享文件夹设置。我唯一怀念官方 Dropbox 客户端的是 Finder 上下文菜单项，用于将共享链接复制到某个项目 - 但我很少需要这样的功能，所以我不太介意在 Dropbox 网站上也这样做。</p><p>另一个很大的区别：<a href="https://help.dropbox.com/installs/dropbox-for-macos-support">官方 Dropbox 客户端正在过渡</a>到 MacOS 相对较新的<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider">文件提供程序 API</a> 。这些 API 允许基于云的存储提供商仅在线保存某些文件，仅在需要时将文件下载到本地。我不需要也不想要那个。我只想完全同步整个 Dropbox 文件夹的内容。 （Maestral 确实支持 Dropbox 的“选择性同步”来省略指定的文件夹和文件，但这些省略的文件根本不会显示在本地文件夹中。）如果您将 Dropbox 文件夹保留在外部硬盘驱动器上，则可能<em>需要</em>切换到 Maestral，因为 Apple 的文件提供程序 API 要求将文件夹存储在<em>~/Library/CloudStorage/</em>中。借助 Maestral，您的本地 Dropbox 文件夹可以位于任何地方。</p><p>底线：11 个月过去了，我是一名非常满意的 Maestral 用户。</p><p>但。在过去一个月左右的时间里，我注意到每当我唤醒我的 Mac（运行 MacOS Ventura 13.4.1 的 M1 MacBook Pro）时，Maestral（版本 1.7.3）就不再运行。当我的 Mac 睡眠时（或醒来时？），它会在后台无声地崩溃。<a href="https://github.com/samschott/maestral/issues/939">这是在 GitHub 上针对该错误提交的问题</a>，六位用户也提出了同样的意见。显而易见的创可贴解决方案是每次唤醒 Mac 时手动重新启动 Maestral，但这很烦人且容易忘记。 Dropbox 的重点在于它只是在后台自动运行。</p><p>在等待 Maestral 本身修复时，这里有两个解决方法。它们应该适用于您想要自动重新启动在后台定期崩溃的应用程序的任何情况。</p><h2>解决方法 1：LaunchControl 和 launchd</h2><p> <a href="https://www.launchd.info/"><code>launchd</code></a>是 Apple 历史悠久的系统（可以追溯到 Mac OS X 10.4），用于按计划或由事件触发运行后台进程。管理<code>launchd</code>作业的内置方法是<code>launchctl</code>命令行实用程序。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-07-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-07-19">1</a></sup> <code>launchd</code>非常书呆子气，并且<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html">有很多功能</a>。</p><p>输入 Robby Pählig 的<a href="https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/">LaunchControl</a> ：“功能齐全的<code>launchd</code> GUI，允许您在 Mac 上创建、管理和调试系统和用户服务。”个人许可证的价格为 21 美元，而且每一分钱都物有所值。 LaunchControl 设计精良、全面且有大量文档。</p><p>就我而言，我想创建一个新的<code>launchd</code>作业，使 Maestral 始终运行。当我的 Mac 睡眠时崩溃时，我只想让它静静地重新启动。使用 LaunchControl 创建这样的作业很简单。</p><p>首先，将 Maestral 应用程序拖放到 LaunchControl 应用程序图标上。这将显示一个如下所示的对话框： </p><p><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/launchcontrol-create-agent.png"
    alt="LaunchControl 的创建代理警报的屏幕截图。"
    width = 50%
  /></p><p>单击“对于当前用户”。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-07-19"><a href="#fn2-2023-07-19">2</a></sup></p><p>就是这样。默认情况下，这正是我们想要的：它创建了一个新的仅限用户的<code>launchd</code>作业，无论如何都可以使 Maestral 保持活动状态。如果崩溃了，它将重新启动。如果我们手动退出 Maestral，它将重新启动。</p><p>我建议的一点手动调整是给这项工作一个描述性的名称。默认情况下，LaunchControl 只是将其命名为“local.job”。我将我的重命名为“local.Maestral.keepalive”：</p><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/launchcontrol-renaming-agent.png" class="noborder"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/launchcontrol-renaming-agent.png"
    alt="LaunchControl 中“保持活动”launchd 作业的屏幕截图。"
    width = 500
  /></a></p><p>此作业的文件（重命名后）位于<em>~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.Maestral.keepalive.plist</em> 。但如果您使用 LaunchControl，则永远不需要处理该文件。如果您想将其丢弃（例如，在 Maestral 的某个版本发布了此错误的修复程序后），您可以在 LaunchControl 本身中执行此操作。</p><h2>解决方法 2：Keyboard Maestro 和 AppleScript</h2><p>对于使用 Maestral 1.7.3 遇到此错误的其他人，上述 LaunchControl/ <code>launchd</code>解决方案就是您所需的解决方法。但我内心的书呆子想知道 Maestral 在后台崩溃的<em>频率</em>。当 Maestral 在我的 Mac 睡眠时崩溃时，它似乎不会留下任何类型的日志来描述发生了什么或何时发生。</p><p>因此，这里有另一种解决方法，这次使用<a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a>和一个小型 AppleScript。首先，在 Keyboard Maestro 中创建一个新的全局宏。我将我的名字命名为“Maestral：Keep Alive”。像这样设置：</p><p> <a href = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/keyboard-maestro-maestro-keepalive.png" class="noborder"><img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/keyboard-maestro-maestro-keepalive.png"
    alt="Keyboard Maestro 中的宏的屏幕截图。"
    width = 500
  /></a></p><p>触发器是“登录时定期”，每分钟运行一次，全天运行一次，一周中的每一天运行一次。该操作是这个简单的 AppleScript：</p><pre> <code>if application &quot;Maestral&quot; is not running then display notification (current date) as string ¬ with title &quot;Maestral was not running&quot; do shell script &quot;/usr/bin/open /Applications/Maestral.app&quot; end if</code></pre><p>如果此脚本运行时 Maestral 正在运行，则不会发生任何情况。如果不是，脚本<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/keyboard-maestro-maestro-keepalive-notification.png">会显示一条包含当前日期和时间的通知</a>，然后启动 Maestral。有时我会注意到唤醒 Mac 后会出现通知，有时却不会。但我可以转到通知中心并查看整个堆栈，以了解其发生的频率。 （事实证明，它每天都会在一夜之间被触发十几次左右。）</p><p>精明的脚本编写者可能想知道为什么我使用<code>do shell script &quot;/usr/bin/open /Applications/Maestral.app&quot;</code>来启动 Maestral，而不是惯用的<code>tell application &quot;Maestral&quot; to launch</code> 。好问题。答案是，每次 Keyboard Maestro 运行这个 AppleScript 时，都需要对其进行编译。每当编译 AppleScript 时，所有以<code>tell</code>块为目标的应用程序（如果尚未运行）都会启动。这只是 AppleScript 工作方式的一个怪癖，但在这种特殊情况下，它会破坏脚本的整个目的，因为当脚本运行时，Maestral 将始终运行，因为如果它在宏开始执行之前尚未运行，它将在 Keyboard Maestro 编译脚本时启动，这发生在脚本实际运行之前。因此，我们使用一行 shell 脚本重新启动 Maestral。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-07-19"><p>标准 POSIX <code>cron</code>实用程序在 MacOS 上仍然受支持，但已被弃用，取而代之的是<code>launchd</code> 。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-07-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-07-19"><p>对于 HIG 学究来说，<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons">标题应该是</a>：“对于当前用户”。 <a href="#fnr2-2023-07-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 与 Maestral、LaunchControl 和 Keyboard Maestro 一起学习</title></entry><entry><title>史蒂文·索德伯格的《Z 命令》 </title><link href="https://commandzseries.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxq" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/18/command-z" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40094</id><published> 2023-07-19T00:47:59Z</published><updated> 2023-07-19T00:50:23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> About 160,000 television and movie actors are going on strike at midnight, joining screenwriters who walked off the job in May and setting off Hollywood&#39;s first industrywide shutdown in 63 years. The leaders of the union, SAG-AFTRA, approved a strike on Thursday, hours after contract talks with a group of studios broke down. Actors will be on the picket line starting on Friday.</p><p> “What&#39;s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor,” said Fran Drescher, SAG-AFTRA&#39;s president. “When employers make Wall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the essential contributors who make the machine run, we have a problem.” [...]</p><p> It&#39;s been even longer — since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films — since actors and screenwriters were on strike at the same time. The dual strikes pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal, Sony and Paramount, as well newer juggernauts like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.</p></blockquote><p> Labor is clearly on the upswing, and there&#39;s no higher-profile union than the Screen Actors Guild, whose members are <em>literal</em> movie stars.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hollywood Actors to Strike, Setting Off Industrywide Shutdown’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/hollywood-actors-strike">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Anchor Brewing Was San Francisco&#39; </title><link href="https://defector.com/anchor-brewing-was-san-francisco" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxc" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/anchor-brewing-sf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40080</id><published> 2023-07-13T21:18:38Z</published><updated> 2023-07-13T22:17:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Patrick Redford, writing for Defector:</p><blockquote><p> It is tempting to read this as another grim story about the pandemic claiming a beloved business, given an extra bit of apocalyptic flair by the degree to which Anchor is synonymous with San Francisco. In that light, the death of one of the city&#39;s most iconic companies goes hand in hand with the narrative that San Francisco is a dying city riven by the tripartite scourges of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-francisco-crime-problem-runs-deeper-than-rosy-statistics-from-city">unchecked crime</a> , spiraling unaffordability, and, uh, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/silicon-valley-bank-wokeness-17841353.php">wokeness</a> . Even if you don&#39;t want to go that far, you can correlate San Francisco&#39;s high office space vacancy rates, declining <a href="https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/featured/craft-sales-continue-to-struggle-in-2023-nbwa-march-beer-purchasers-index-confirms/">national craft beer sales</a> , and “inflation,” and conclude that this economy was too harsh for Anchor to survive in. Indeed, how can any small business keep its lights on under such conditions? That is the story Sapporo&#39;s PR goons are selling and <a href="https://twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1679038989121077249">the San Francisco Chronicle</a> is buying, without any pushback or worker perspective, even though it&#39;s not true. Economic conditions matter, though they aren&#39;t nearly as relevant to the Anchor story as Sapporo&#39;s uniquely catastrophic stewardship of the company.</p></blockquote><p> A fine remembrance, replete with great links to further reading, including <a href="https://lithub.com/the-model-for-americas-modern-craft-beer-boom-inside-the-small-brewer-scene-in-1950s-san-francisco/">this excerpt</a> from David Burkhart&#39;s book, published just last year, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-anchor-brewing-story-america-s-first-craft-brewery-san-francisco-s-original-anchor-steam-beer-david-burkhart/7277948?ean=9780399581236">The Anchor Brewing Story</a></em> .</p><p> What comes to mind is that small-scale excellence is delicate and precious. It seems unfathomable that Anchor could be losing money when their beer remains as popular as ever, but leave it to a large conglomerate like Sapporo to tank a good small thing in the name of making it a bigger thing.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Anchor Brewing Was San Francisco’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/anchor-brewing-sf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The &#39;X&#39; Stands for Bullshit </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23792553/elon-musk-xai-artificial-intelligence-company" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uxb" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/xai" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40079</id><published> 2023-07-13T02:26:10Z</published><updated> 2023-07-13T02:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jess Lander and Caleb Pershan, reporting sad news for the San Francisco Chronicle:</p><blockquote><p> San Francisco institution Anchor Brewing Co., the godfather of steam beer, is shutting down after 127 years. The brewery was “losing millions of dollars a year,” said Anchor spokesperson Sam Singer. “Economic pressures have made the business no longer sustainable.”</p><p> Anchor has already brewed its final beer at the historic Potrero Hill brewery — “there&#39;s no steam coming out of the brewery now,” said Singer — and notified the brewery&#39;s 61 employees of the shutdown early Wednesday morning. The brewery&#39;s taproom, Anchor Public Taps, will continue operating until at least Aug. 1, possibly longer.</p><p> The news comes one month after Anchor announced it was halting national distribution and discontinuing its beloved Christmas Ale, which it has produced since 1975. When Japanese beer giant Sapporo purchased Anchor in 2017, the company was already “in the red,” according to Singer, who said that revenue is down by two-thirds since 2016. The pandemic was especially challenging for the brewery, added Singer, as it typically sells most of its beer through bars and restaurants. The brewery attempted to expand its retail distribution but was “unable to break through in a big enough way,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>真丢脸。 “Drink local” is always good advice, and Anchor Steam in San Francisco was always delicious. I&#39;m not sure why they ever distributed Anchor Steam nationally, though — it was one of the worst-travelling beers I&#39;ve ever had. Local and fresh: delicious. Trucked to the east coast: meh. Before I tried it in San Francisco I always wondered what the fuss was about.</p><p> I knew something was wrong <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sdw/110704071761624623">when they debuted their absurd redesign</a> .

<p>No Apple action on Threads yet but Reuters reports some social media platform news:</p><blockquote><p> Tencent&#39;s WeChat said on Tuesday that iPhone maker Apple had opened a store on its social media platform, marking an expansion of the US firm&#39;s retail channels in the world&#39;s second largest economy. The announcement by WeChat, China&#39;s dominant messaging app which also provides e-commerce, livestreaming and payment services, said users would be able to buy Apple products including iPhones, iPads and Macs from the store.</p><p> China&#39;s smartphone sales in the first quarter fell 5% year on year, marking the lowest first-quarter sales figure for the country since 2014, according to data from Counterpoint Research.

<p>Jordan Novet, reporting for CNBC:</p><blockquote><p> A federal judge in San Francisco has denied the Federal Trade Commission&#39;s motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Microsoft from completing its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard.</p><p> The deal isn&#39;t completely in the clear, though. The FTC can now bring the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and the two companies must find a way forward to resolve opposition from the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom.</p></blockquote><p> The deadline to close the deal is next week, but the market expects it to happen:</p><blockquote><p> Activision Blizzard shares reached a session high and 52-week high of $92.91 per share after the US District Court for the Northern District of California issued the decision. Microsoft had agreed to buy the game publisher for $95 per share. Activision Blizzard stock ended Tuesday&#39;s trading session at $90.99 per share, up 10%.</p></blockquote><p> This is another case where the Biden FTC is barking up the wrong tree. Microsoft is a major player in video games, to say the least, but Xbox is the third-place console, and Microsoft has made a legally-binding commitment not just to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation for 10 years, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/call-of-duty-on-switch-is-back-on-after-microsoft-wins-ftc-court-case">but to bring the franchise to Nintendo Switch</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Microsoft’s $75 Billion Acquisition of Activision Moves Closer as Judge Denies FTC Injunction’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/microsoft-activision-deal-closer">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Tape Deck Dongle&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/07/11/ep-381" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/ux4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/the-talk-show-381" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40072</id><published> 2023-07-12T16:46:24Z</published><updated> 2023-07-12T17:00:16Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>It seems like every company is scrambling to stake their claim in the AI goldrush — check out the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/the-ceo-of-kroger-mentioned-ai-8-times-on-the-company-s-earnings-call#xj4y7vzkg">CEO of Kroger promising</a> to bring LLMs into the dairy aisle. And front line workers are following suit–experimenting with AI so they can work faster and do more.</p><p> In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is overflowing with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: punching up emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk.</p><ol><li> <strong>Malware:</strong> Security researchers keep uncovering <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/beware-ai-scams-meta-blocks-1000-plus-links-tied-to-chatgpt-themed-malware">AI-based extensions</a> that steal user data. These extensions play on users&#39; trust of the big tech platforms (“it can&#39;t be dangerous if Google lets it on the Chrome store!”) and they often appear to work, by hooking up to ChatGPT et al&#39;s APIs.</li><li> <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Companies including Apple and Verizon have banned their employees from using LLMs because these products rarely offer a guarantee that a user&#39;s inputs won&#39;t be used as training data.</li><li> <strong>Prompt Injection Attacks:</strong> In this little known but <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">potentially unsolvable attack</a> , hidden text on a webpage directs an AI tool to perform malicious actions–such as exfiltrate data and then delete the records.</li></ol><p> Up until now, most companies have been caught flat-footed by AI, but these risks are too serious to ignore.</p><p> At Kolide, we&#39;re taking a two-part approach to governing AI use.</p><ol><li> <strong>Draft AI policies as a team.</strong> We don&#39;t want to totally ban our team from using AI, we just want to use it safely. So our first step is meeting with representatives from multiple teams to figure out what they&#39;re getting out of AI-based tools, and how we can provide them with secure options that don&#39;t expose critical data or infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>Use Kolide to block malicious tools.</strong> Kolide lets IT and security teams write <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3PJW32Q">Checks that detect device compliance issues</a> , and we&#39;ve already started creating Checks for malicious (or dubious) AI-based tools. Now if an employee accidentally downloads malware, they&#39;ll be prevented from logging into our cloud apps until they&#39;ve removed it.</li></ol><p> Every company will have to craft policies based on their unique needs and concerns, but the important thing is to start now. There&#39;s still time to seize the reins of AI, before it gallops away with your company&#39;s data.</p><p> To learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">click here to watch an on-demand demo</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta.

<p>When Twitter unceremoniously pulled the plug on third-party clients earlier this year, commercial Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific were left in a perilous position. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff" title="Tweetbot and Twitterrific Face the Cliff">I wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Twitter&#39;s kneecapping of third-party clients didn&#39;t just mean that their <em>future</em> revenue was gone — it meant <em>revenue they&#39;d already collected</em> from App Store subscriptions would need to go back to customers in the form of prorated refunds for the remaining months on each and every user&#39;s annual subscriptions. Consider the gut punch of losing your job — you stop earning income. It&#39;s brutal. Now imagine that the way it worked when you get fired or laid off is that you&#39;re also suddenly on the hook to pay back the last, say, 6 months of your income. That&#39;s where Tapbots and The Iconfactory are.</p><p> I can&#39;t recall a situation like this, with an ecosystem of third-party clients collecting subscriptions and then having the first-party service yank the carpet out from under them — and their customers — with zero warning or sunset period.</p></blockquote><p> Alas, this situation has become a recurring theme. Now it&#39;s <a href="https://apolloapp.io/">Apollo</a> , the exquisitely well-made Reddit client by Christian Selig. The situation is nearly identical: Apollo stopped working earlier this week, and Selig is on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in refunds to annual subscribers.</p><p> Just as with Tweetbot and Twitterrific, if you&#39;re a subscriber to Apollo, here&#39;s what you can do to support Selig:</p><ol><li> Reinstall Apollo if you&#39;ve already deleted it; otherwise, make sure you&#39;re running the latest version.</li><li> Tap the “I Don&#39;t Need a Refund” button.</li><li> Feel good and go buy yourself a treat, knowing you helped a talented developer (and nice person).</li></ol><p> Here&#39;s Selig, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/14nb5qs/today_is_apollo_for_reddits_last_day_and_i_just/">in his goodbye post on the Apollo subreddit</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It feels disingenuous on the surface to say “I want to thank all of you”, but in this case it&#39;s demonstrably true. I&#39;ve worked on this app for over 9 years, and I&#39;ve never felt burned out, I get such a crazy amount of energy and enjoyment out of building something so publicly alongside such an awesome community, and you seriously have no idea how easy product development is when your north star is just “listen to what people are saying”. [...]</p><p> I&#39;m really heartbroken with how this whole process unfolded, I truly drank the Kool Aid talking to Reddit at the beginning that this was something they were going into in good faith with the interest of developers, moderators, and the community as a whole, but as many people pointed out to me, it&#39;s clear now that ultimately wasn&#39;t their intent. If they wanted something that could work for everyone, they would have simply made an effort to listen, instead of being dishonest, callous, and punitive in pricing. I&#39;m sorry to all the folks who, like me, lost Apollo abruptly as a result of this. I had so much more I wanted to do with this app!</p><p> But, legitimately, I really feel a sense of that “Don&#39;t cry because it&#39;s over, smile because it happened” right now. I grew up so much developing Apollo, I met and learned from so many incredible people, made lifelong friends, got to go to multiple WWDCs and was even featured in a few, and I got to work on a product and platform I absolutely loved for 9 years. That&#39;s an incredible run, and it&#39;s hard to feel anything but thankful for that.</p></blockquote><p> In addition to the “I Don&#39;t Need a Refund” button, the final release of Apollo has a bunch of bonus content, including a few dozen wallpapers and some treats for Selig&#39;s other app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6443919232">Pixel Pals</a> . I find Selig&#39;s good spirits in the face of this debacle to be inspiring.

<p>Le Monde:</p><blockquote><p> French police should be able to spy on suspects by remotely activating the camera, microphone and GPS of their phones and other devices, lawmakers agreed late on Wednesday, July 5. Part of a wider justice reform bill, the spying provision has been attacked by both the left and rights defenders as an authoritarian snoopers&#39; charter, though Justice Minister Éric Dupond-Moretti insists it would affect only “dozens of cases a year.”</p><p> Covering laptops, cars and other connected objects as well as phones, the measure would allow the geolocation of suspects in crimes punishable by at least five years&#39; jail. Devices could also be remotely activated to record sound and images of people suspected of terror offenses, as well as delinquency and organized crime.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s unclear from this article whether the law would simply allow police to <em>try</em> to do this, using security exploits to plant malware on targets&#39; devices, or if France is going to mandate that all devices include back doors to enable it. Either way, good luck with that. The way the article is written, it&#39;s made to seem that the police have the technical ability to just do this.他们不这样做。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Le Monde: ‘France Set to Allow Police to Spy Through Phones’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/07/france-privacy-security-police">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> GQ Shits the Bed </title><link href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/07/05/gq-pulled-david-zaslav-article/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwy" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/07/gq-shits-the-bed" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40066</id><published> 2023-07-07T17:19:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-07T18:46:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Will Sommer, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> In an unusual step, GQ magazine removed an article critical of powerful media executive David Zaslav from its website just hours after it was published Monday, following a complaint from Zaslav&#39;s camp. [...] At one point, Bailey compared Zaslav to tyrannical “Succession” patriarch Logan Roy. “In a relatively short period of time, David Zaslav has become perhaps the most hated man in Hollywood,” Bailey wrote.</p><p> A Zaslav spokesman complained to GQ about the story soon after it was published, according to people close to the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve confidences. By early afternoon on Monday, the magazine had made extensive edits to the story. [...]</p><p> Bailey told The Washington Post that, after GQ made the changes, he asked editors to remove his byline. He said an editor told him that GQ would not keep an article on its website without the author&#39;s name. By Monday afternoon, the article was removed entirely from the site.</p></blockquote><p> Humiliating cowardice on the part of GQ&#39;s editors. The <a href="https://archive.is/ftmBd">original article</a> was harsh but accurate. It had some zingers, yes, but it was mostly just a factual list of the actual shitty and stupid things Zaslov has done since he took the helm of the newly combined Warner Bros Discovery conglomerate. Why would GQ do this? There&#39;s a wee bit of a bad smell with this:</p><blockquote><p> GQ has a corporate connection to Warner Bros. Discovery. The magazine&#39;s parent company, Condé Nast, is owned by Advance Publications, a major shareholder in Warner Bros. Discovery. Advance Publications did not respond to a request for comment.</p></blockquote><p> But over at Variety, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/gq-editor-david-zaslav-story-producing-movie-warner-bros-1235662109/">Tatiana Siegel uncovers the stench</a> :</p><blockquote><p> GQ editor-in-chief Will Welch is producing a movie at Warner Bros. titled “The Great Chinese Art Heist,” which is based on a 2018 GQ article by Alex W. Palmer. [...] Sources say Welch was involved in the discussions surrounding the removal of Bailey&#39;s initial story and made the call to pull the revamped story, which ran some 500 words shorter than the published version. Those same sources say Warner Bros. Discovery complained about the initial story to two GQ editors, one of whom was Welch.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘GQ Shits the Bed’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/07/gq-shits-the-bed">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> MrBeast Trolls Elon Musk on Threads </title><link href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuXrpemRV3m" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwx" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/07/mrbeast-trolls-musk" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40065</id><published> 2023-07-07T16:49:15Z</published><updated> 2023-07-07T16:49:15Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Max Tani, reporting for Semafor:</p><blockquote><p> On Wednesday, Instagram parent company Meta introduced Threads, a text-based companion to Instagram that resembles Twitter and other text-based social platforms. Just hours later, a lawyer for Twitter, Alex Spiro, sent <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ifn0l6bs/production/27109f01431939c8177d408d3c9848c3b46632cd.pdf">a letter</a> to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg accusing the company of engaging in “systematic, willful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter&#39;s trade secrets and other intellectual property.”</p></blockquote><p>祝你好运。</p><blockquote><p> Spiro accused Meta of hiring dozens of former Twitter employees who “had and continue to have access to Twitter&#39;s trade secrets and other highly confidential information.”</p><p> He also alleged that Meta assigned those employees to develop “Meta&#39;s copycat &#39;Threads&#39; app with the specific intent that they use Twitter&#39;s trade secrets and other intellectual property in order to accelerate the development of Meta&#39;s competing app, in violation of both state and federal law as well as those employees&#39; ongoing obligations to Twitter.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s comical to think that Meta needed engineers from Twitter to build Threads. Like Twitter is a model of reliability and stability, and Meta&#39;s platforms don&#39;t serve an entire order of magnitude more users. Even more comical:</p><blockquote><p> Andy Stone, Meta&#39;s communications director, told Semafor that Twitter&#39;s accusations are baseless. “No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee — that&#39;s just not a thing,” he said.</p></blockquote><p> Even if ex-Twitter employees <em>were</em> working on Threads, Elon Musk fired them. It&#39;s not illegal to hire people fired by a competitor. Would be kind of wacky if it were. This letter is so transparent: Musk is threatened by Threads and jealous of the mountain of media attention it&#39;s getting, so he&#39;s lashing out. Commanding his lawyer to send a silly letter like this feels like a Trump move, no exaggeration.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Twitter Is Threatening to Sue Meta Over Threads, Meta Executives Threaten to Piss Their Pants Laughing’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/twitter-threatens-suit-over-threads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Mastodon&#39;s FAQ on Threads </title><link href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwv" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/mastodon-threads-faq" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40063</id><published> 2023-07-06T23:47:02Z</published><updated> 2023-07-06T23:47:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Eugen Rochko, founder and CEO of Mastodon:</p><blockquote><p> Today, Meta is launching its new microblogging platform called Threads. What is noteworthy about this launch is that Threads intends to become part of the decentralized social web by using the same standard protocol as Mastodon, ActivityPub. There&#39;s been a lot of speculation around what Threads will be and what it means for Mastodon. We&#39;ve put together some of the most common questions and our responses based on what was launched today.</p></blockquote><p> What strikes me about this FAQ is that nearly every question has no basis in reality. It&#39;s calming the irrational fears of people who view Facebook as a corporate bogeyman. Having <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open" title="Daring Fireball: ‘Not That Kind of Open’">written</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/more_on_preemptively_blocking" title="Daring Fireball: ‘More on Preemptively Blocking Facebook’s Imminent ActivityPub Entry’">quite a bit</a> recently about Threads joining the open fediverse, I can vouch that these fears are real, insofar as people really do think Threads is somehow going to steal their data, or that Facebook is somehow going to show ads to people on Mastodon servers, but those fears have no more basis in reality than worrying about monsters who live under your bed.</p><p> Here&#39;s the one that really matters:</p><blockquote><p> <em>Will Meta embrace-extend-extinguish the ActivityPub protocol?</em></p><p> There are comparisons to be made between Meta adopting ActivityPub for its new social media platform and Meta adopting XMPP for its Messenger service a decade ago. There was a time when users of Facebook and users of Google Talk were able to chat with each other and with people from self-hosted XMPP servers, before each platform was locked down into the silos we know today. What would stop that from repeating? Well, even if Threads abandoned ActivityPub down the line, where we would end up is exactly where we are now. XMPP did not exist on its own outside of nerd circles, while ActivityPub enjoys the support and brand recognition of Mastodon.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Mastodon’s FAQ on Threads’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/mastodon-threads-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Custom Domain Names as Bluesky Handles — Fun Feature, and Now a Business Model </title><link href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwu" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/06/bluesky-domain-names" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40062</id><published> 2023-07-06T22:18:43Z</published><updated> 2023-07-07T16:01:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From the official Bluesky (pro tip: rhymes with <em>brewski</em> and <em>Russki</em> ) blog:</p><blockquote><p> We believe that there must be better strategies to sustain social networks that don&#39;t require selling user data for ads. Our first step in another direction is paid services, and we&#39;re starting with <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">custom domains</a> . While setting up a custom domain to use with Bluesky and the AT Protocol is fairly straightforward, it does require some familiarity with domain registrars and DNS settings. Yet, over 13,000 users have already either repurposed domains they already owned to use as handles, or purchased a domain solely because of Bluesky. Domains have so much potential as a personalized way to customize identities and as a decentralized way to verify reputation that builds off the existing web. For example, US Senators have used the <code>senate.gov</code> domain to verify their identity on Bluesky without our involvement, and a third-party developer built a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb">web extension</a> that checks if websites are linked to an AT Protocol identity. The possibilities are wide in the domain-as-a-handle space.</p><p> <em>We&#39;re partnering with Namecheap, a popular domain registrar, to <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">offer a service</a> for easy domain purchasing and management.</em> With this, people can set a custom domain as their handle on Bluesky and the AT Protocol in under a few minutes.</p></blockquote><p> Making it a built-in feature and a source of recurring revenue for the Bluesky company — legally, a public benefit corporation — is a great idea. Using a custom domain name as your handle is one of the best features of Bluesky and the AT Protocol, and it really is rather simple. But by building it in as a feature, Bluesky can make it <em>super</em> simple, and remove the possibility of error.</p><p> In Bluesky&#39;s settings (which are relatively concise), go to “Change Handle” under “Advanced”. Then tap (or click) “I have my own domain.” On the next screen enter the domain name you own and wish to use in the top field, and Bluesky <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/bluesky-custom-domain.png" title="Screenshot of the Bluesky iPhone app, with custom domain name information for my account gruber.foo.">will show you the domain and value to enter at your registrar</a> . I&#39;m using “gruber.foo”, but you can just as easily use a subdomain like “john.gruber.foo”. The Daring Fireball account on Bluesky will be “daringfireball.net” — I could have used “gruber.daringfireball.net” for my personal account. A publication like, say, The New York Times could allow reporters to each have official Bluesky accounts like “ <em>reportername</em> .nytimes.com”.

Some initial thoughts and observations:</p><ul><li><p> The website&#39;s home page contains just a link to the apps for iPhone and Android, but you can view the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber" title="Threads profile page for my account, @gruber.">profile pages for users</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVYKiNxmWy/" title="Permalink to my first post on Threads, wherein I point out that just like its older sibling Instagram, the iOS app is only for iPhone, not iPad.">permalinks for posts</a> (threads?).</p></li><li><p> The iOS app only supports an iPhone layout. I suppose I should <em>not</em> find this surprising, given that 13 years after launching, Instagram&#39;s iOS app <em>still</em> doesn&#39;t support the iPad natively, but somehow I <em>do</em> find this surprising. What a fucking mystery for the ages it is that Instagram won&#39;t make iPad apps.</p></li><li><p> They&#39;re going with the “www” prefix on the web, just like Instagram. That feels archaic to me.</p></li><li><p> The website is view-only. You can&#39;t log in, post, or reply. No indication whether this is temporary or by design.</p></li><li><p> URLs are similar to Instagram&#39;s: domain name + “/t/” + unique post ID. (Where Threads uses a “/t/” (for <em>threads</em> ), Instagram uses a “/p/” (for <em>post</em> , I presume.) For example: <code>https://www.threads.net/t/CuRtcYTNY3J/</code> . Much better would be a URL format that includes the username of the poster, so you can tell who posted it just by looking at the URL. Example URLs that show attribution:</p><p> Twitter: <code>https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1667603292162240512</code><br /> Bluesky: <code>https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jznmowkftf2e</code><br /> Mastodon: <code>https://mastodon.social/@daringfireball/110652280163526529</code></p></li><li><p> Signing in was incredibly easy using my existing Instagram credentials, which were already on my phone because I have Instagram installed. I didn&#39;t even need to re-enter my password. Same username, same avatar, and I opted in to following the exact same accounts on Threads that I follow on Instagram.</p></li><li><p> The timeline is algorithmic — it shows you threads both from people you follow and from people you don&#39;t. Just after Threads went live to the public, my timeline was almost entirely from accounts I don&#39;t follow, seemingly users who&#39;ve been testing Threads while it was in beta. As I type this sentence a few hours later, however, my timeline is mostly from people I follow, and thus much more enjoyable. But as yet, there&#39;s no way to filter your timeline to <em>only</em> show threads from accounts you&#39;ve chosen to follow.</p></li><li><p> You can search for accounts, but there&#39;s no content search (yet?).</p></li><li><p> No hashtags (yet?) <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVKuinPTcH/">either</a> . Good riddance, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVWW5URH66/">I say</a> , but I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re forthcoming.</p></li><li><p> One feature Threads <em>has</em> launched with, though, are quote posts (retweets in Twitter parlance). Bluesky has them too. Quote posts are useful, fun, and central to the way many people use Twitter. And Mastodon doesn&#39;t have them — not by omission, but by design. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314523447694321" title="Me on Mastodon, back in early May, predicting that Bluesky will eclipse it in popularity.">As I&#39;ve quipped</a> , Bluesky feels like a new service for people who liked what Twitter used to be. Threads feels like that too. Mastodon feels like a service for people who hated Twitter, and nothing exemplifies that more than its lack of quote posting.</p></li><li><p> Posts are limited to 500 characters, which I think is the upper bound for a Twitter-like service.</p></li><li><p> No word about an API yet. I&#39;m not suggesting that Threads might offer an API to enable third-party clients — no way Facebook would do that — but there ought to be a programmatic interface for bots and such if they want to eclipse Twitter. ( <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVafQTvquB">Which Zuckerberg is already stating as a goal</a> .)</p></li><li><p> Speaking of Zuck, in addition to being <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/replies" title="Mark Zuckerberg's Threads account.">quite active</a> on Threads out of the gate, he posted to Twitter for the first time in 11 years, and <a href="https://twitter.com/finkd/status/1676747594460962817">it&#39;s perfect</a> .</p></li><li><p> Over 5 million people signed up for Threads in the first 4 hours after launch. (There are <a href="https://mastodon-analytics.com/">about 1.2 million active Mastodon users</a> .)</p></li><li><p> No ads yet. If Threads is successful, surely there will be ads. But in the meantime, it makes for a much better experience than Twitter, where the ads are frequent, large, <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1669783032558137344">and scammy</a> . (And they soon <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/yaccarino-sound-on-ads">might start playing sound</a> .)</p></li><li><p> The site/app seems a bit slow/flaky at the moment, but overall is holding up, and still seems faster than Mastodon.</p></li><li><p> Threads is available in over 100 countries, but not yet in the EU, <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/no-instagram-threads-app-in-the-eu-irish-dpc-says-metas-new-twitter-rival-wont-be-launched-here/a1927220337.html">thanks to their draconian and confusing Digital Markets Act</a> . Rather than forcing US and Asian companies to comply with their regulations, the EU seems more likely to be isolating its citizens from the broader world.</p></li><li><p> ActivityPub federation isn&#39;t supported yet but is forthcoming. Instagram chief <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuRtcYTNY3J">Adam Mosseri posted</a> :</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re committed to building support for ActivityPub, the protocol behind Mastodon, into this app. We weren&#39;t able to finish it for launch given a number of complications that come along with a decentralized network, but it&#39;s coming.</p><p> If you&#39;re wondering why this matters, here&#39;s a reason: you may one day end up leaving Threads, or, hopefully not, end up de-platformed. If that ever happens, you should be able to take your audience with you to another server. Being open can enable that.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h2> I Like Threads&#39;s Chances</h2><p> The overall vibe of Threads is probably not for me. It&#39;s not frantic, but it is busy, and very pop-culture-y. If you&#39;re the sort of person who wants a quiet timeline comprised only of posts from carefully curated accounts, Threads is not for you, and probably never will be. But the sort of people who like Twitter&#39;s “For You” feed and trending topics in the sidebar might find Threads more fun.</p><p> So I&#39;m bullish on Threads&#39;s chances for long-term success:</p><ol><li> The world needs, or at least wants, something like Twitter.</li><li> Twitter itself is falling apart under Musk.</li><li> Mastodon is inherently too confusing for mass market adoption, and in ways that can&#39;t be fixed without some central authority coming in and imposing a solution, which is against the fediverse&#39;s ethos. That doesn&#39;t mean Mastodon is doomed or bad. Just that it&#39;s never going to achieve mainstream popularity.</li><li> Bluesky — which is the one I&#39;m rooting for, personally — remains invitation-only as they scale and continue to define their underlying protocol.</li><li> All the other Twitter-like upstarts like <a href="https://post.news/">Post</a> and <a href="https://t2.social/">T2</a> and whoever else have no traction at all.</li><li> Threads starts with 1 billion eligible users, who already have their usernames, and can opt into following the exact same people they follow in Instagram, which is a product that continues to thrive and which people enjoy.</li><li> Facebook and Instagram know how to operate at the highest possible scales — both technically and regarding content moderation. Instagram&#39;s content moderation record is far from perfect, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/11/20/masnicks-impossibility-theorem-content-moderation-scale-is-impossible-to-do-well/">but content moderation at scale is impossible to do perfectly</a> . Facebook does it better than anyone, and much better than Twitter.</li></ol><p> I even like the name “Threads” — it&#39;s short, easy to spell, memorable, makes for a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/threads-icon.png">clever icon/logo</a> , and even starts with a “T”, reminding people of Twitter. The word <em>tweet</em> has been a nice thing for Twitter to have stumbled onto. (They didn&#39;t coin it; <a href="https://furbo.org/2013/06/28/the-origin-of-tweet/" title="Craig Hockenberry: ‘The Origin of Tweet’">Twitterrific did</a> .) <em>Tweet</em> works both as a noun and verb and everyone in the world knows what it means, whether they use Twitter or not. I don&#39;t think <em>thread</em> is going to take off as a verb for Threads, but it&#39;s a great noun for posts, and it reinforces the notion that you&#39;re supposed to engage with posts by replying.</p><h2> Elsewhere</h2><p> <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/meta-unspools-threads">Casey Newton has an interview with Mosseri</a> at Platformer. Regarding the EU, Mosseri said:</p><blockquote><p> The more pressing concern at the moment is to launch Threads in all the countries where Meta wants to. It won&#39;t be available in the European Union to launch as Meta works to ensure that Threads complies with the EU&#39;s new data privacy regulations.</p><p> “That&#39;s just going to take a while, unfortunately — and I&#39;m particularly frustrated about this point, because I&#39;ve been living outside of the US for a year now,” said Mosseri, who has been working from London. “I&#39;ve been on a total kick with my teams about stop launching things in only a couple countries, and not in other countries. … But in this case, it was either we wait on the EU, or delay the launch by many, many, many months. And I was worried that our window would close, because timing is important.”</p></blockquote><p> Regarding the opportunity for Threads, as Twitter self destructs, Newton writes:</p><blockquote><p> When the competition is an app <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/06/30/cisgender-twitter-musk-suspension/">where “cisgender” is considered a slur</a> , Threads has an easy time standing out as an oasis of calm and civility.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor">Mosseri also granted an interview to Alex Heath at The Verge</a> , where he had a thoughtful answer to the question of why Threads is a standalone app:</p><blockquote><p> It was a hugely contentious debate internally. You could be in feed. You could be a separate tab. You could be a separate app. The challenge with text posts in feed is that the post and comment model just fundamentally does not support public discourse as well as the model that Twitter pioneered with tweets and replies. Treating replies as equal as opposed to subordinate somehow just allows for a very different and much more broad range of public conversations. People do post text to Instagram all the time, even though we don&#39;t support it first class, and we&#39;re experimenting with that, too. That&#39;s great, but I think it solves a much smaller use case than public discourse more broadly.</p><p> Then there&#39;s a separate app versus separate tab. Separate tab is tough. There&#39;s only so much stuff you can shove in the app. It&#39;s already feeling too complicated. We&#39;re trying to actually simplify right now, and so it&#39;s certainly working against that. And generally, when you build a separate tab, you find you want to push all that distribution through a feed invariably in order to bootstrap it. You kind of end up right back in that first problem.</p><p> A separate app is way less likely to succeed because you have to bootstrap a user base from very little or from nothing. But if you do it, if you succeed, the upside is so much more significant.</p></blockquote><p> Lastly, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230705/p27#a230705p27">Techmeme&#39;s exhaustive compilation of coverage and commentary</a> .</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Threads</title></entry><entry><title> Instagram&#39;s Threads App Was Briefly Listed on Google Play Over the Weekend </title><link href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1675060648579854336" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwp" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/threads-play-store" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40057</id><published> 2023-07-04T02:30:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-04T02:42:34Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Threads, the ActivityPub-compatible Twitter clone from Instagram, briefly (and presumably inadvertently) was listed in the Google Play Store over the weekend. The app itself wasn&#39;t available, but Alessandro Paluzzi captured screenshots. The icon is plain but clever: a thread in the shape of an “@”. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-new-app-threads-twitter-listed-google-play-android-store-2023-7">showing up in the Play Store in Europe</a> , too.</p><p> That Threads is seemingly very close to launching makes Twitter&#39;s rate-limiting all the more baffling.

Those with Basic or Pro plans — paying $100 and $5000 a month for API access, respectively — have experienced unannounced changes to their plans, numerous bugs, and often receive zero customer support. And developers shelling out for Twitter&#39;s Enterprise API Plan, which starts at $42,000 per month, are experiencing sudden outages and disappointing service considering the money they&#39;re paying.</p><p> “Everything used to work fine before we started paying half a million per year,” shared one developer in a private Twitter developer group chat shared with Mashable.</p></blockquote><p> This is how Twitter is dealing with <em>paid</em> services.

<p>Matt Levine, in his Money Stuff column:</p><blockquote><p> Well, look, if <em>I</em> were the newly hired chief executive officer of a social media company, and if the directors and shareholders who brought me in as CEO had told me that my main mission was to turn around the company&#39;s precarious financial situation by improving our position with advertisers, and if I spent my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/technology/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino.html">first few weeks</a> reassuring advertisers and rebuilding relationships and talking up our site&#39;s unique audience and powerful engagement, and then one day my head of software engineering came to me and said “hey boss, too many people were too engaged with too many posts, so I had to limit everyone&#39;s ability to view posts on our site, just FYI,” I would ... probably ... fire ... him?</p><p> I mean I suppose I might ask questions like “Is this because of some technological limitation on our system?

<p>Ivan Mehta, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> Over the weekend, Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/01/twitter-imposes-limits-on-the-number-of-tweets-users-can-read-amid-extended-outage/">limited the number of tweets</a> users can read in a day, which he said was to prevent data scraping. While this measure has affected all Twitter users, TweetDeck users in particular are today reporting major problems, including notifications and entire columns failing to load.</p><p> Musk initially enforced read-limits of 6,000 daily posts for verified users and 600 daily posts for unverified users. Hours later, he increased these limits to 10,000 tweets and 1,000 tweets, respectively. Given that TweetDeck loads up multiple tweets through various columns simultaneously, it&#39;s likely that the effects of the read restrictions are amplified within TweetDeck.</p></blockquote><p> Needless to say it&#39;s rather nutty that a business whose primary revenue stream is advertising would institute rate limits at all, let alone severe limits that typical users bump up against <a href="https://mastodon.social/@julipuli/110650981176518772">in about 20 minutes of browsing</a> . Musk&#39;s thinking, one presumes, is that <em>this</em> is the masterstroke that will prompt people to sign up for Twitter Blue at $8-11/month.</p><p> The bigger, more fundamental change Musk instituted over the weekend is making it such that tweets aren&#39;t visible unless you&#39;re logged in to a Twitter account. This broke all sorts of things. Messaging apps (like Apple&#39;s Messages) can no longer render preview cards for tweets, for one thing. Closer to home, it broke <a href="https://twitter.com/daringfireball">the @daringfireball auto-posting account</a> . More amusingly, <a href="https://sfba.social/@sysop408/110639474671754723">as documented by Sheldon Chang</a> , this change completely broke Twitter itself — some part of the Rube Goldberg-ian machine that assembles users&#39; timeline feeds was itself subjected to these rate limits, so Twitter wound up DDOSing itself. It&#39;s like a gasoline company instituting rations that stranded its own fleet of tanker trucks.</p><p> From its <a href="https://medium.com/social-media-help/first-tweet-f2f0530cfa2d">inception</a> through this weekend, Twitter has been like blogging, insofar as tweets being public. You visit the URL for a tweet, you see the tweet. Now it&#39;s a walled garden, like most of Facebook, available only to logged-in users. I suspect this change will prevent the Internet Archive from caching tweets, too. That just sucks.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Everything Continues to Be Going Just Great at Twitter’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/everything-continues-to-be-going-just-great-at-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WSJ: &#39;Goldman Is Looking for a Way Out of Its Partnership With Apple&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-is-looking-for-a-way-out-of-its-partnership-with-apple-79849a91" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwo" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40056</id><published> 2023-07-03T17:00:00Z</published><updated> 2023-07-03T21:53:18Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AKAekQoCCQE2082_Qekyo0g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The Wall Street firm is in talks with American Express to take over its Apple credit card and other ventures with the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldman went public with plans to scale back its consumer business late last year, but it appeared committed to the Apple relationship. The bank recently extended the partnership through the end of the decade, agreed to support Apple&#39;s “buy now, pay later” offering and launched a bank account with the tech company.</p><p> Now it is in talks to offload those businesses and its credit-card partnership to Amex, according to people familiar with the discussions. A deal with Amex isn&#39;t imminent or assured, people familiar with the conversations said, and it could take a while to transfer the partnership in any case. Apple would have to agree to a transfer. The tech company is aware of the talks, which have been ongoing for months, the people said. [...]</p><p> In January, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-lost-3-billion-on-consumer-lending-push-11673616202?mod=article_inline">Goldman disclosed that it had lost about $3 billion</a> on the consumer-lending push since 2020.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s unclear how much of Goldman&#39;s losses in their consumer banking foray are attributable to the Apple Card specifically, but Sridhar Natarajan reported for Bloomberg <sup>*</sup> back in January <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-13/goldman-lost-1-2-billion-in-just-nine-months-in-newest-division">that it&#39;s the source of <em>most</em> of their losses</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The division&#39;s $1 billion pretax loss reported for 2021 was mostly tied to the Apple Card, people with knowledge of the numbers said. And about $2 billion in 2022 mainly stems from the Apple card and installment-lending platform GreenSky, the people said.</p></blockquote><p> How you lose money issuing credit cards that charge usurious interest rates is beyond me. Not quite in the territory of Donald Trump somehow losing money while running casinos, but it&#39;s up there. Are they issuing Apple Cards to deadbeats? (Apparently, yes: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/goldmans-gs-apple-card-business-has-a-surprising-subprime-problem.html">they&#39;ve been issuing a lot of cards to people with bad credit</a> .)</p><p> If Goldman does bail, AmEx would be as good a partner as any for Apple: they know how to deliver a premium experience <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/american-express-ceo-says-the-business-is-firing-on-all-cylinders-fe875f3d">and turn a good profit doing so</a> .</p><p> <small>* <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con">You know</a> .</small></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘WSJ: ‘Goldman Is Looking for a Way Out of Its Partnership With Apple’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Astra Carta Seal </title><link href="https://www.sustainable-markets.org/astra-carta/astra-carta-seal/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/astra-carta-seal" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40053</id><published> 2023-07-03T16:26:59Z</published><updated> 2023-07-03T16:29:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Humane:</p><blockquote><p> Humane, Inc. today announced its first device will be called the Humane Ai Pin, the latest detail to be revealed ahead of its launch later this year. The Humane Ai Pin is a new type of standalone device with a software platform that harnesses the power of AI to enable innovative personal computing experiences. [...] Humane&#39;s first device will be powered by an advanced Snapdragon platform from Qualcomm Technologies. [...]</p><p> Dev Singh, Vice President, Business Development of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. commented: “We are proud to be collaborating with Humane and that this first-of-a-kind clothing-based wearable device will be powered by Snapdragon. Humane&#39;s Ai Pin will deliver a superior AI experience and feature an assortment of on-device AI capabilities. Its revolutionary and sleek form factor is packed with powerful performance so that it can make sense of real-time contextual information and provide the wearer with a new and exciting experience. We cannot wait to see where they take this device.”</p></blockquote><p> We&#39;ll have to take Singh&#39;s word for it that the form factor is “revolutionary and sleek”, as they still aren&#39;t showing it.</p><p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779654/humane-ai-pin-name-launch-date">David Pierce at The Verge</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Humane continues to be mysterious about how the Ai Pin works, what exactly it will do, and even what it looks like. (Most mysterious of all: why in the world is “AI” not capitalized? What is “Ai?” Am I supposed to pronounce it like “eye?” I am confident this will infuriate The Verge&#39;s copy desk and me in equal measure for years to come.)</p></blockquote><p> The Daring Fireball Style Desk is on break for the extended US holiday weekend, and hasn&#39;t yet issued a ruling.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Humane Reveals Product Name: ‘Ai Pin’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/02/humane-ai-pin">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/apple_silo_twitter" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uwb" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40043</id><published> 2023-06-28T22:40:39Z</published><updated> 2023-07-05T22:27:03Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> It&#39;s hard not to think that Twitter, bereft of premium brand advertisers and looking to jumpstart its foray into hosting long-form video content, is getting more from this *Silo* promotion than Apple is getting from newfound viewers. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1673730750095712256">Apple TV, yesterday on Twitter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> 3 days until the #Silo finale.</p><p> Here&#39;s the entire first episode.</p></blockquote><p> Embedded right in that promoted tweet is the entire series premiere. <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-28"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-28">1</a></sup></p><p> Putting aside, for this paragraph, the politics surrounding Twitter, this is a rather interesting promotional move. You can watch the premiere episodes for all Apple TV+ original series for free in the Apple TV app: <em>Silo</em> , <em>Ted Lasso</em> , <em>Severance</em> , <em>The Morning Show</em> , <em>Hijack</em> (the new thriller starring Idris Elba) — all of them. It&#39;s an obvious strategy: get hooked on even one of these premieres and it costs just $7/month to watch the rest. The biggest obstacle to any streaming service is just getting someone to <em>try</em> it. Everyone with an iPhone or iPad or Mac already has Apple&#39;s TV app installed, and a lot of people already have the app on their TVs or set top boxes. But Apple isn&#39;t linking from Twitter to the TV+ app — they&#39;ve shared the entire episode right on Twitter itself. Not YouTube, not Facebook.推特。 That wasn&#39;t even technically possible <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/twitter-now-allows-paid-users-to-upload-two-hour-long-videos/">until last month</a> .</p><p> But asking anyone today to put aside the politics of Twitter is a bit like the old “ <em>But other than that, how&#39;d you enjoy the play, Mrs. Lincoln?</em> ” joke. There is a number one user on Twitter, and that user is Elon Musk, and his politics and policies are veering<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4061600-musk-says-cis-cisgender-considered-slurs-on-twitter/">more toxic</a> , not less, as time goes on. Advertising is fundamentally about paying to reach an audience, not an endorsement of content, but at some level it&#39;s a partnership. Publishers and platforms reject objectionable ads, and advertisers eschew objectionable platforms. Where is that line for Apple with Twitter?</p><p> Musk, unsurprisingly, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1673831774038949888">seems exultant</a> over Apple&#39;s <em>Silo</em> promotion, which includes a custom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/wwdc-2023-hashflag/">hashflag</a> icon. And here&#39;s no less an influencer than MrBeast, Jimmy Donaldson, <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1673850123967770624">replying to Musk</a> : “Really is a smart move, I never would have heard of this show and now I&#39;m watching episode 1 and invested lol.” If you&#39;re wondering why Apple would even <em>consider</em> continuing to advertise on Twitter, there&#39;s your answer: the platform still has tremendous reach.</p><p> Apple spends a veritable fortune on advertising across a slew of media. But the only place where I see anyone asking “Why is Apple advertising <em>there</em> ?” is Twitter. It&#39;s hard not to think that Twitter, bereft of premium brand advertisers and looking to jumpstart its foray into hosting long-form video content, is getting more from this <em>Silo</em> promotion than Apple is getting from newfound viewers. It&#39;s not the money (which Musk has plenty of), it&#39;s the prestige (of which Twitter is by most accounts bankrupt). You can&#39;t buy prestige, and Apple has chosen to bestow some on Twitter through this promotion. Is it <em>outrageous</em> that Apple continues to advertise on Twitter? I say no. But it feels a bit skeevy, and more than a little curious, that they choose to.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-28"><p> I started watching <em>Silo</em> a few weeks ago and I like it a lot. Season one does a good job revealing a bit more of the overall mystery each week, while simultaneously doling out some answers along the way. Strong premise, good cast, good production values. It&#39;s no <em>Severance</em> but it&#39;s really good. (I feel the same way about <em>Foundation</em> , but I like <em>Silo</em> better.) It&#39;s a good show and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/silo-renewed-season-2-apple-1235643158/">already been renewed for a second season</a> .

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/21/ftc-sues-amazon-over-deceptive-prime-sign-up-and-cancellation-process.html">Annie Palmer, reporting for CNBC last week</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sued Amazon, alleging the nation&#39;s dominant online retailer intentionally duped millions of consumers into signing up for its mainstay Prime program and “sabotaged” their attempts to cancel.</p><p> The agency claims Amazon violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers&#39; Confidence Act by using so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice, to push consumers to enroll in Prime without their consent.</p></blockquote><p> Some links:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-takes-action-against-amazon-enrolling-consumers-amazon-prime-without-consent-sabotaging-their">The FTC&#39;s own announcement</a> , which contains a link to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/amazon-rosca-public-redacted-complaint-to_be_filed.pdf">the very heavily redacted complaint</a> . (Apparently the redactions are at Amazon&#39;s behest, not the FTC&#39;s, but they render at least half of it meaningless.)</li><li> <a href="https://twitter.com/linakhanftc/status/1671530338852405250">A Twitter thread from FTC commissioner Lina Khan</a> summarizing the case.</li><li> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-sues-amazon-over-manipulative-tactics-to-enroll-users-in-premium-service-85400564?mod=djemalertNEWS">The Wall Street Journal&#39;s story on the lawsuit</a> , which — shocker, I know — somehow doesn&#39;t mention that The Wall Street Journal itself requires subscribers to <em>make a phone call</em> to cancel a digital subscription to the Journal.</li><li> “ <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf">Amazon&#39;s Antitrust Paradox</a> ” — Khan&#39;s seminal 2017 paper published in The Yale Law Journal.</li></ul><p> I find the FTC&#39;s case against Amazon to be weak sauce at best, and bordering on frivolous. Their argument that Amazon has made it difficult to cancel a Prime subscription is just wrong. Yes, it&#39;s a few more clicks than it takes to sign up for Prime, but I don&#39;t think any of those steps are arduous or unnecessary or unfair or confusing. And in the context of Amazon&#39;s entire website — <a href="https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/amazon-website">infamously sprawling</a> — it&#39;s really rather <em>easy</em> to find.</p><p> The FTC might have a better case that Amazon has used deceptive dark patterns to get people to <em>sign up</em> for Prime, but I don&#39;t find their case compelling. (Note, however, my above remark that their complaint is heavily redacted. Perhaps some of the redactions cover essential evidence.) But it fails the sniff test in one regard: I&#39;ve never once heard of anyone complaining that they were tricked into a Prime membership that they didn&#39;t knowingly sign up for. I&#39;ve seen people complaining about how hard it is to cancel all sorts of other subscriptions and memberships. Cable TV providers like Comcast make it really hard to cut the cord. Gyms are notorious for requiring you to cancel a membership in person. And The New York Times only recently began allowing subscribers to cancel over the web, rather than calling and talking to a human whose job it is to <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/new-york-times-writer-unwittingly-calls-out-manipulative-design-at-his-own-paper-99e50c660d59">talk you out of cancelling</a> . Like I mentioned above, The Wall Street Journal <em>still</em> requires this. That should be illegal.</p><p> But Amazon Prime? I&#39;ve never seen anyone complain about this.</p><p> It&#39;s way easier to cancel a Prime membership than most subscriptions. And most of the steps the FTC delineates are reasonable “Are you sure?” precautions. It&#39;s like complaining that it takes a few more steps to empty the Trash in MacOS (or Recycle Bin on Windows) than it does to create a new file or folder — destructive actions <em>should</em> take a few extra steps.</p><p> I&#39;d be all in favor of the FTC pursuing and enforcing laws that require <em>all</em> subscription services to have clear, discoverable cancellation options online. In fact, it seems ridiculous that the FTC hasn&#39;t already done this. But singling out Amazon only makes sense insofar as that Lina Khan made a name for herself as a critic of the company.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/amazon-friction-and-the-ftc/">Ben Thompson, today at Stratechery</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This, to my mind, is the chief reason why this complaint rubs me the wrong way: even if there is validity to the FTC&#39;s complaints (more on this in a moment), the overall thrust of the Prime value proposition seems overwhelmingly positive for consumers; surely there are plenty of other products and subscriptions that aren&#39;t just bad for consumers on the edges but also in their overall value proposition and reason for existing.</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ FTC Sues Amazon, Claiming &#39;Deceptive&#39; Prime Sign-Up and Cancellation Process</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
