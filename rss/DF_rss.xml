<p>本周，杰森·斯内尔（Jason Snell） <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/" title="六种颜色：“ 2024年的苹果：六种颜色成绩单”">在2024年发布了他的六种颜色苹果报告卡</a>。 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/01/my_2020_apple_report_card" title="大胆的火球“我的2020年苹果成绩单”">正如</a>我过去所做的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/my_2022_apple_report_card" title="大胆的火球“我的2022 Apple成绩单”">那样</a><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/my_2019_apple_report_card" title="大胆的火球“我的2019年苹果成绩单”">-</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/my_2023_apple_report_card" title="大胆的火球：“我的2023 Apple成绩单”">2023、2022、2021、2020、2019、2018-</a>我在这里发表完整的讲话<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/my_2021_apple_report_card" title="大胆的火球“我的2021苹果成绩单”">和</a><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card" title="大胆的火球“我的2018年苹果成绩单”">成绩</a>。在Snell的成绩单上，选民给出的分类得分从5到1不等；我将这些翻译成字母等级，A到F，这就是我考虑的方式。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-07">1</a></sup></p><p>我的大多数成绩与一年前没有变化。对于那些发生了变化的人，我注意到去年的括号成绩。当我写成绩单时，我没有意识到这一点，但是从去年开始的每个成绩都<em>较低</em>。没有一个年级上升。考虑到这一点，当我今天写这序言时，感觉很正确：苹果在2024年保持一致的卓越表现，但我想不出一个苹果升级的单个领域。不是一个。这感觉像是一个问题。 <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-07">2</a></sup></p><p>还值得注意的是，“ Siri”不是成绩单中的独立类别。我们的评分者只是将其评论为其他类别和产品（例如HomePod或Apple Music）中的一个方面。从历史上看，这是有道理的 - 当它<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/10/04Apple-Launches-iPhone-4S-iOS-5-iCloud/">开始</a>时，Siri只是iOS 5的一个浮华的新功能。但是，在这一点上，我认为“ Siri/Apple Intelligence”显然应该被视为本身的类别。思考它的一种方法：任何构成<a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">苹果高级高级主管</a>的整个领域的东西都可能应该是报告卡上的类别。对于Siri和Apple Intelligence来说，这就是<a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a> 。另一方面：苹果自己<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=apple+intelligence+commercials">对苹果情报的繁重营销</a>表明，他们自己认为这是公司的类别级别。我建议Snell提出这一点，他正在考虑将其作为明年的适当类别。 （毫不奇怪，考虑到他<a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/where-will-apple-intelligence-go-next/">对这个问题的敏锐写作</a>，他已经在我ping ping之前就已经考虑了。）</p><p>如果“ Siri/Apple Intelligence”<em>是</em>此成绩单的类别，我将其分级为d，并且比F的距离要比C.长期以来的Siri功能不仅<em>变得</em>更好，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">而且似乎变得更糟</a>。苹果根本不是爆炸性流行的LLM游戏中的相关玩家。 “苹果智能”伞下的功能主要感觉就像苹果在准备好了一年之前，仅仅是因为行业的其他成员和华尔街 - 遥遥领先于他们，他们觉得有必要运送自己拥有的东西，准备好了没。有很多显然有用的潜在AI驱动功能 - 在应用程序之间集成的功能和/或在设备上使用您的个人数据 - 由于苹果本身为iOS设计的严格限制的沙箱系统，只有Apple本身才能提供通过AI。苹果公司不提供自己的网络搜索引擎，因为Safari可以使用<a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/kagi">您想要的</a>任何搜索引擎。 Siri<em>很</em>糟糕，因为只有Siri才能与设备以及您的私人交叉应用数据在系统级别紧密整合。节省的宽限期 - 使我无法提供此类别类别的If-If-Apple ML/AI功能实际上很棒。照片中的图像搜索非常出色，有时令人惊叹。照片中新的清理生成的AI对象/人员删除工具在技术上都非常好，无论是在技术上还是在摄影本身的性质上达到自以为是的平衡。私人云计算是一项非常雄心勃勃的倡议，但我们还没有看到太多的果实。</p><h2> Mac：</h2><p>苹果运输的Mac比以往任何时候都更好。到目前为止，最受欢迎的Mac车型是笔记本电脑，MacBook Pro和空中阵容都有良好的岁月。更好的是，现在似乎都按照常规的年度升级时间表：秋季的MacBook Pros，MacBook在春季播出。我个人对新的纳米纹理（Matte）显示选项现在在MacBook Pros上以$ 150的额外额外的价格提供，我特别高兴，边缘性欣喜若狂。 （他们甚至没有比14英寸的16型选项收取更多的费用。）</p><p>阵容中唯一的障碍是苹果公司<em>没有</em>发货的Mac：Mac Studio和Mac Pro以来自2023年以来M2车型首次亮相以来<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111835">一直保持</a><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111343">不变</a>。我的推定/直觉是，由于与TSMC的第一代3NM流程有关的工程原因，他们跳过了M3一代，并将在2025年以WWDC围绕WWDC的新M4生成模型重回正轨。</p><p> MacOS 15红杉（如14个Sonoma和13个文图拉）是一个很好的释放。可靠和熟悉。我在很大程度上不使用（或至少<em>还</em>没有使用太多）的苹果智能功能很容易被忽略，并且不会妨碍尝试和真实的事物，到目前为止，这是世界上最大的计算平台看到。</p><h2> iPhone：</h2><p>如果没有破产，请不要修复它。关于iPhone阵容，什么都没有破坏，苹果没有试图修复任何东西。这很好。为了变革而变化是公司下降的最可靠迹象。停滞和傲慢是任何巨大成功的产品的关注点，但是让出色的设计自信地说明自己而不必进行不必要的改变。</p><p>相机控制是iPhone 16代的新硬件大型更改，尽管我希望看到实际按钮改善（我认为这太难按下），但实际上，我经常使用它。在假期期间，我花了一些时间在iPhone 15上，我立即错过了一个相机控制按钮来启动相机应用程序。另外：对苹果公司将相机控制带入整个iPhone 16阵容的荣誉，而不仅仅是专业模型。</p><p> iOS 18是精致，成熟和熟悉的。</p><h2> iPad：c</h2><p> iPad硬件故事很棒。 iPad Pros提前几个月获得了M4芯片，现在拥有出色的纳米纹理显示选项。 （请，苹果：将纳米文本带到iPhone。拿我的钱。）iPad Air在5月对M2芯片进行了很好的更新。 iPad Mini自2021年以来获得了首次更新，因此<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/transcript-phil-schiller-craig-federighi-and-john-ternus-on-the-state-of-apples-pro-macs/">继续成为Apple阵容中的产品</a>。</p><p>但是，iPados仍然像无人体的平台一样让我着迷：在Mac的生产力下，远不及我的生产力差不多；远不及iPhone的便携式或概念简单。我做出了一致的努力，除了近几个月外，除了长期阅读外，我都不会将iPad用于任何东西。我发现自己对此有所提高。对我来说，试图在iPad上工作，继续想在戴手套时试图进行手术。</p><h2>总体可穿戴设备：b</h2><p> ANC的AirPods 4是一个了不起的更新。 Airpods Pro 2虽然拥有多年的硬件，但今年的软件改进了大量改进 - 最著名的是，广受好评的支持作为认证的助听器。 AirPods继续为苹果提供了最好的体现。</p><h2> Apple Watch：C（去年：B）</h2><p> Series 10 Watches具有一个新的显示屏，该显示器在节能始终在线模式下以每秒更新为单位。因此，即使显示器不完全打开，模拟脸上的秒针也可以每秒“勾选”一次。但是，苹果仅在两个手表面上启用了滴答滴答的秒指示器，包括Watchos 11：<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/faces-and-features-apde9218b440/watchos">磁通和反射</a>。撇开我个人不喜欢这两个面孔的事实（尤其是故意钝的粉刺），这太荒谬了。 WatchOS 11提供了我的快速计数，至少33个不同的手表面提供了非数字秒或指示器。其中只有2个支持新的1Hz刷新率？那是胡扯。这不仅仅是发射的东西，因为我们在2月，WatchOS 11.3，并且已经更新了其他手表面以支持它。这不是认真的制表师如何对待手表。我将承认<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch">比大多数人更关心始终秒的手</a>，但这并不是一个认真的制表师如何以1Hz刷新速度处理这样的新展示的技术突破。不仅大多数，而且每个手表面都应该更新以支持滴答滴答的几秒钟。 Apple Watch正在将更多的健身追踪器变成恰好显示时间的健身追踪器，并且无法用作适当的手表。</p><p>另外：今年没有Ultra 3。一年历史的Ultra 2确实获得了非常不错的黑色钛颜色选项，仅此而已。一款起价为800美元的手表有点奇怪，这似乎很受欢迎，可以跳过一年的硅改进。</p><h2> Vision Pro：B（去年：N/A）</h2><p>这是一个热门吗？不，远离它。但是我仍然<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/vision_pro_bites_dog">不相信苹果有很大的希望</a>，即第一个视觉设备的销售量会比以前要高得多。这是一个可笑的胸围的叙述，使我想起了1984年原始的Macintosh，其价格为2500美元，根据通货膨胀进行调整，以今天的美元计算到7,500美元以上。在发起最初的宣传浪潮之后，最初的Macintosh的销量如此之差，以至于可以说是John Sculley和Apple董事会解雇Steve Jobs并将其流放到公司中的主要动力。这个时代的许多专家都自信地宣称，GUI的整个概念是一个gi头，没有未来。</p><p>我是否预测，视觉平台将像1984年的Macintosh一样明亮而必不可少的未来？不。但是我怀疑它在它之前拥有<em>光明</em>而基本的未来。整个概念和范式是如此新颖和不同，以至于像Macintosh 40年前一样，该产品必须以吸引大众市场的价格制作版本的几年，并且在有很多事情要做之前要做很多事情使用它。</p><p>但是，就目前而言，Vision Pro今天为观看传统电影和节目提供了令人难以置信的体验，以及观看空间内容的突破性经验。如果Bang＆Olufsen以仅播放电影的形式出售了该产品（没有“空间计算”），它将花费10,000美元，有些人认为这很有价值。空间计算对我来说很有趣，但效率不高。这可能会改变，我怀疑“有趣但没有生产力”是我将如何描述尝试在1984年与Apple II进行Macintosh工作的方式。 Vision Pro的非凡（以及Visionos 2，大大改善） <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118521">MAC虚拟显示</a>功能是一个高度生产的工作环境。</p><p>我不能为2024年提供Vision Pro A，但是我预计将来几年的A。</p><h2>主页：D（去年：C）</h2><p>我不能为HomeKit或2024年与家居相关的任何事物命名，这是一个非常需要许多改进的平台。不过，手指交叉了2025年。我知道那个团队中有才华横溢的人，他们必须做些什么。</p><h2> Apple TV：C（去年：B）</h2><p>我每天（每晚，每晚）Apple TV用户非常高兴。但是，2024年有什么改善或更改？任何事物？可以公平地说，当前的硬件 -  Apple TV 4K 3rd-Gen，该硬件在2022年11月发货 - 很好，这是一个只需要每3或4年需要更新的硬件平台，但是我们正在对发生的一切进行分级在2024年。</p><p>另外：我觉得苹果还没有为这个平台做出真正的远程控制。当前的是他们迄今为止最好的，但是它有明显的缺陷。</p><h2>服务：b</h2><p>电视+远非最大的流媒体服务，但我坚决地认为，它的质量内容的击球平均最高。电影仍然是一个弱点：<em>狼</em>应该很棒，但平庸和令人难忘。那是电视+年度最佳电影。但是电视+系列赛继续表现出色：<em>慢马</em>有另一个饼干赛季，<em>因为所有人类都</em>表现出了第四季，而诸如<em>Dark Matter</em> ， <em>Bad Monkey</em>和<em>Thused Innocent</em>之类的新节目都很强大。电视+也是小孩的出色流媒体平台。</p><p> iCloud，尤其是在iCloud Plus的情况下，保持安全，快速和可靠。它可以在设备之间实现如此多的无缝连续性（因此，这些功能的“<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">连续性</a>”伞品牌）。</p><p>但是我们又在这里再次，我重复了过去几年的同样的痛苦：苹果仍然在免费层中提供仅5 GB的存储空间，并且自从Forever Forever Forewange Wefters nat flanganged sward sote。我垃圾大于5 GB。我想知道那里有多少千亿iPhone用户没有设备备份，因为他们只有一个带有5 GB的iCloud帐户？ Apple One Bundle是一笔不错的选择，但是免费的iCloud Tier应该对备份现代iPhone确实有用。现在，付费加上层次应该提供的存储空间比它们更多。</p><h2>硬件可靠性：</h2><p>在这一类别中，没有消息仍然是个好消息。</p><h2> Apple OS质量：B<br/> Apple Apps：b</h2><p>一年前的评论和评分不变：我对Apple软件<em>设计</em>方向的方面的关注和抱怨是（或者在某些方面已经存在了多年），但它们的软件<em>可靠性</em>对我来说非常好。</p><p>一个奇怪的趋势：苹果公司的几个最新应用程序，例如日记和体育（现在，虽然在2024年报告卡的时间边界之外，邀请函）仅适用于iPhone。甚至没有iOS，包括iPhone和iPad。只是iPhone。特别是日记也属于iPados和Macos，人们拥有用于写作的硬件键盘。</p><h2>开发人员关系：D（去年：C）</h2><p>连续第四年与基本相同的评论：对App Store政策的不满。 App Store审查过程的挫败感似乎尚未解决。苹果的目标应该是使开发人员关系变得如此好，以至于开发人员寻找借口以专门为苹果平台创建软件。相反的情况正在发生。</p><p>今年全球的重大变化是《数字市场法》在欧盟生效。我与库比蒂诺（Cupertino Punditry）球拍中的许多人分开，鼓掌苹果（Apple）的合规工作。我认为他们尽力而为地遵守了一项可怕的法律，同时保护自己的平台应如何设计和工作。 （当然，还要保护自己对苹果应该如何能够将这些平台获利的愿景。）但是，即使我 - 一个人认为苹果的工作已经做出了出色的工作，运送了大量工作以遵守DMA-不能也不会说Apple在DMA Front上的任何努力已经修复或改善了与第三方开发人员的关系。</p><p>尽管情况在很大程度上没有变化，但我已经将这个主题从C到D的成绩调整了，因为停滞正在赶上苹果。更多的是使事情变得更糟。而且我认为我们看到了本地应用程序对Vision Pro的相对缺乏。有一个新平台等新平台，例如Visionos。在新平台中引起开发人员兴趣的最佳方法是向许多正在寻找要使用的应用程序和玩游戏的用户出售许多单元。但是，向许多用户出售许多硬件单元的最佳方法是拥有第一<em>和</em>第三方应用程序和游戏的深度独家生态系统。</p><p>借助以前的新开发人员平台（例如iOS和Mac OS X），Apple通过吸引只是想为一个很棒的新平台创建出色的新软件的开发人员，从而在这个初始的难题中得到了动力。去年对Visionos来说，这种热情受到了极大的调整，我认为这比开发人员对Apple和App Store的感觉更多，而不是他们对Vision Pro本身的感觉。</p><h2>社会和社会影响：B（去年：A）</h2><p>斯内尔（Snell）对此类别的提示指出：“考虑您认为适当的任何事情，包括教育和环境计划，对可及性和多样性的承诺，对苹果劳动力的待遇以及其他政治和政策立场。”苹果在环境方面的努力继续使我成为非凡的努力。他们的可访问性功能远远领先于行业的其余部分，以至于我什至不知道谁位居第二。在社会问题上，通过忠于其长期，人道的，常识价值观，苹果的文化在整个社会中的一系列动荡的岁月中似乎完全一致，在此期间，其他公司首先猛烈地抛弃了，现在恰好正确。</p><p>如果我在那儿停下来，那将使一个显而易见的成绩。但是：政治。我了解（我认为）蒂姆·库克的思想和方法。我不想他的工作，有时真的想知道谁会。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">唱歌的祝贺推文</a>留下了痛苦的味道，但是我可以说首席执行官必须播放他们所经历的卡片，而不是他们所希望的卡片。如果您必须提供狗屎三明治，请提供狗屎三明治 - 但不要告诉我们它们的味道像南瓜派。蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）不能向特朗普（Trump）的就职典礼基金捐款100万美元，苹果<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/the-great-american-tradition">仅向拜登（Biden）捐赠了43,200美元</a>，并期望我们除了嘲笑库克（Cook）的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">理由</a>而做任何事情。以团结精神就职典礼。”那是蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）的霍吉（Hoagie）大小的狗屎三明治，不尊重我们咬一些人来帮助他度过难关。</p><p>我真的相信库克正在为苹果做最好的事情，这实际上是他的工作。但是，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/cook_trump_campaign_ad">在第一个特朗普政府中，这是事实</a>，并且已经在第二个政府中再次出现了，对苹果在政治上最有利的是与对国家和全世界最好的东西冲突。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-07"><p>在我以前的报告卡中，我将其描述为e（a = 5 ... e = 1），但是在美国，学校<a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/9283/grading-system-why-a-f-and-not-e">传统上</a>（但<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uofu/comments/bofpny/what_is_the_difference_between_an_e_grade_and_an/">并非总是</a>）省略e作为字母等级，并将f用作低于D的等级，作为<em>失败</em>的显而易见的速记 -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">显然</a>，要对一些使用E代表<em>出色的</em>系统的怪异学校的歧义。 （我给该分级系统一个F。）我从来没有不必对E和F进行过很多思考，因为我从来没有想到要在任何类别中给出失败的成绩是适当的。但是，考虑了今年的假设“ Siri/Apple Intelligence”类别，使我对失败的成绩进行了漫长的思考。我意识到应该是F，而不是<a href="#fnr1-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">E.↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-07"><p>如果您对我说：“<em>来吧，您无法想到一个</em>单一的<em>区域，苹果在2024年比2023年做得更好吗？不是一个？必须有一些东西……</em> ”我会毫不犹豫地提供Apple TV原创内容作为回应。正如我一个月前写的那样，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/31/">在一年中的最后一篇文章中</a>，我会与任何人争辩说，Apple TV+原创节目的平均质量高于任何其他流媒体平台。这确实是新的HBO，不是最内容，而是最佳内容。那是非常<em>苹果</em>。</p><p>但这不是六种颜色报告卡上的单独类别。 Apple TV+属于“服务”（根据我在此报告卡中称赞这类别），而我对Apple TV+的原始内容的敬意很高，这并不能证明我的整体“服务”成绩是合理的。从财务上讲，这是一个庞大的类别，十年前成为苹果的第二大，似乎处于 <a href="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apple-earnings-1.png?ssl=1">最终超越iPhone</a>的<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">轨迹上</a>- 从B到A。</p><p>我不认为苹果对娱乐制作的尝试是一种分散注意力。 Apple的人们从事计算机硬件，软件和服务的工作，无论是工程师，设计师，经理，甚至是高级管理人员，都不以任何方式参与TV+。这并不是说苹果是现金浪费的，并将有限的资源转移到娱乐生产预算上，而牺牲了产品开发或研发。苹果公司是世界上最有价值，最有利可图的公司，可以有点像一个集团的行为，而不会失去其制造世界上最好的计算机的核心业务，而客户享受了世界上最好的计算机体验。电视+是人们订阅Apple One Services Bundle的凳子上的重要脚步。但是，至少，我认为苹果去年最有所进步的地区至少有点令人担忧，这与该核心业务完全无关。</p><p>卓越，无论持续多长时间，总是不稳定 -

This should leave you with a <em>bootable</em> clone of your startup drive.</li><li> <em>Smart Update</em> — This does what you think a “smart” update would do. Instead of copying everything, every time, it just copies and erases what&#39;s necessary to make the Data volume on the destination disk identical to the Data volume on the source disk. If you start with a fresh, empty external drive as the destination, it has to copy everything, but subsequent Smart Update runs will run in a portion of the time. But the nature of how it works means that it can only clone the read/write Data volume of your startup drive. That means it won&#39;t copy the OS from the read-only System volume. No matter what else you do (which I&#39;m about to cover), that&#39;s OK, because the result of a Smart Update is an external drive containing all of your own files and installed apps, and, crucially, it&#39;s a disk that you can use as the source for Migration Assistant.</li></ul><p> So if you <em>always</em> use “Erase, then copy”, your SuperDuper external backups will always be bootable clones of your startup drive, with the same version of MacOS installed as your internal disk. The only downside to doing it this way is that backups take longer, because you&#39;re erasing the external drive and copying everything every time. (You don&#39;t have to supervise SuperDuper backups in any way, so how long they take doesn&#39;t really matter much.)</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Smart Update”, you won&#39;t have a bootable external drive (because the read-only System volume is never copied over), but you will have all your own files, and the external drive will work as a source for Migration Assistant.</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Erase, then copy” to create the initial backup clone, but <em>subsequently</em> use “Smart Update” for incremental backups, all of <em>your</em> data and installed apps will be updated on the external drive each time you back up. And the drive should remain a bootable backup — but the version of MacOS installed on the external drive will remain unchanged from the initial “Erase, then copy” backup. This is how I&#39;ve been running SuperDuper.</p><h2> Why Bootable Backup Drives Still Matter</h2><p> In the course of writing this article — which I&#39;ve been thinking about, and researching, on and off since December, when the MacOS 15.2 replicator bug broke SuperDuper&#39;s ability to create bootable backups — I&#39;ve shaken some of my own longstanding assumptions about my backup needs. I&#39;ve been making bootable clones with SuperDuper since whenever I started using it, which was over two decades ago. The earliest of mention of SuperDuper on Daring Fireball is this post, explaining how I installed OS updates at the time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/12/software_update" title="Daring Fireball: “Software Update Tips and Voodoo”">from December 2004</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I use <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a> for cloning my entire startup drive.我强烈推荐它。</p></blockquote><p>还是真的！ I have no intention to stop making regular backups of my entire startup drive using SuperDuper. But: do I care anymore whether they&#39;re bootable? If you&#39;d asked me before December, I would have said yes, definitely.为什么？ Because, my thinking went, if something catastrophic happened to my internal startup drive, and I was working on something urgent, I&#39;d want to get back up and working again as soon as possible. Rather than wait for MacOS Recovery to reinstall the OS on the internal drive and then wait for Migration Assistant to copy my data from my external drive to the clean install of MacOS on the internal drive, I could just boot from the external backup drive and get back to work immediately.</p><p> I&#39;ve been lucky enough over my now many years as a Mac user to have suffered very few disk calamities like that. But I&#39;ve encountered them. And there have been situations when having an up-to-date bootable backup drive has been useful, if not crucial. But, upon reflection, I realize now that it&#39;s been many many years since the last time I even thought to boot from my backup drive. I used to even periodically test that the backup drive was, in fact, bootable, as a precaution. I haven&#39;t done that in years.</p><p> I mentioned above that for my regular backup cloning, I use SuperDuper&#39;s Smart Update, which leaves the read-only installation of MacOS on the backup drive unchanged. I just checked today and while my MacBook Pro is running the current version of MacOS (15.3 Sequoia), the version on my cloned backup drive was 12.6.1 Monterey, which was released in October 2022. (That&#39;s the last time I did a full “Erase, then copy” backup in SuperDuper.) That effectively means my backup drive <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been bootable, or at least not <em>usefully</em> bootable. For example, all my email files are in the mailbox format expected by Apple Mail in MacOS 15.3;我怀疑MacOS 12.6的Apple邮件是否可以读取这些邮箱文件。 The same is probably true for just about every app — or at least every system app from Apple — that I use. Surely <em>some</em> software from MacOS 12.6 can&#39;t read the files or settings from the software from MacOS 15.3, and I&#39;ll bet a lot of it can&#39;t. New software can often recognize old file formats generated by older versions of the software; old software can&#39;t recognize new file formats that were introduced after the old software was written.</p><p> What you should do, if you really want bootable startup drive backups via SuperDuper, is use “Erase, then copy” after every MacOS software update. Or just use “Erase, then copy” every time. But the fact that I wasn&#39;t doing this for the last two years doesn&#39;t mean my cloned backup drive has been useless. It just means it&#39;s only been useful for restoring backed-up data, not for booting my Mac. Which, when I think about it, is how I would have used it if I had needed to. I don&#39;t work in a fast-paced production environment with tight deadlines. I think MacBooks really only run properly when booting from their internal drives, anyway. If something ever goes wrong with mine, I&#39;ll try using Disk Utility to repair it, and if that fails, I&#39;ll turn to MacOS Recovery to clean install the OS and then use Migration Assistant to copy my data back from my external backup驾驶。</p><p> Thinking about it, booting from an old version of MacOS on an external backup drive containing data from the current version of MacOS sounds like a good way to corrupt some of the files on that disk — subverting the entire purpose of a backup. (Most likely, if you try this, the Mac will simply fail to boot.) It&#39;s reckless to boot from and “use” a backup drive for production when the source drive that it&#39;s a clone of has failed — at that point, your backup drive is your only local copy of the data from that failed drive. It really only ought to be treated as a read-only source for restoration. And the way Macs are designed to work today, with MacOS Recovery and Migration Assistant, makes that pretty easy.</p><p> The last time I had a catastrophic problem with my startup drive was in 2010, and I wrote about how I recovered, gracefully and with no drama (nor, seemingly, an iota of lost data), in a piece I titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox">An Ode to DiskWarrior, SuperDuper, and Dropbox</a> ”. More of my digital life is in the cloud — and thus replicated in at least one place other than my Mac&#39;s startup drive — now than then. Off the top of my head, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of anything I do on my Mac that isn&#39;t synced to cloud storage via Dropbox, iCloud, or IMAP. Starting in 2014 I&#39;ve also been a customer of <a href="https://backblaze.com/thetalkshow">Backblaze</a> , a set-it-and-forget-it online backup service (that, for many years, has been a regular sponsor of this site and The Talk Show, but I recommend it because it&#39;s good, not because they have been and might someday again be a sponsor). That&#39;s <em>another</em> copy of all my personal data backed up somewhere. <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-06">5</a></sup></p><p> Having my SuperDuper-cloned backup drive be bootable is nice to have, but I really can&#39;t say I <em>need</em> it any more. 20, 15, even just 10 years ago, that wasn&#39;t true — I really did want the ability to boot from my backup drive at a moment&#39;s notice. But that&#39;s really not true any more for me. It probably isn&#39;t for you, either. It definitely isn&#39;t true for most Mac users.</p><p> But it remains true for <em>some</em> people, who are using (or responsible for) Macs in high-pressure tight-deadline production environments. Live broadcast studios. Magazines or newspapers with a deadline for the printer that&#39;s just hours (or minutes) away. Places with strict security/privacy rules that forbid cloud storage of certain critical files. If the startup drive on a production machine fails, they need to get up and running <em>now</em> . Plug in a backup drive, restart, and go. Anything longer than that is unacceptable.</p><p> That&#39;s not me. That&#39;s probably not you. But there are a lot of people whose work environment that describes. For as much as Apple Silicon Macs have become iOS-like devices in many ways, they&#39;re still Macs at heart: workstations. There remain people inside Apple who know that, too.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-06"><p> Fun fact gleaned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">the Wikipedia entry for HFS Plus</a> : “Codenamed <em>Sequoia</em> in development, HFS+ was introduced with the January 19, 1998, release of Mac OS 8.1.” I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s further proof that Apple has a penchant for reusing old code names, or if code-name reuse is simply inevitable for a nearly 49-year-old company that&#39;s always been chockablock with secret projects. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-06"><p><em>丁。</em> <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-06"><p> One of the ways that APFS is very “modern Apple” is that it&#39;s largely a black box.

It&#39;s surprising that any of it survived. As a kid/teen in the &#39;80s, everything of mine existed only on floppy disks. Even the smallest-capacity hard drives were exorbitantly expensive. Apple&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Disk_20">Hard Disk 20</a> was a 20 megabyte external drive that cost $1,500 when it debuted in 1985, which is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">about $4,400</a> in today&#39;s dollars. That was a ton of money. But the floppy disks of the time were just 400 KB — a Hard Disk 20 gave you the storage of 50 of them. But even floppy disks were expensive, to a kid. We&#39;d fill them up faster than we could buy them, and we&#39;d re-use the same floppies over and over when we need a “new” one. That was not great for data integrity on a storage medium so primitive that it was exposed to the air. In the &#39;90s we all had hard drives, but those hard drives were always almost full. We were constantly copying files off our hard drives to floppies for “storage”, to create a little free space. It felt like remarkable progress when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive">Zip disks</a> appeared, which were like “super floppies”, each containing 100 MB. We lived our digital lives one catastrophic hard drive failure away from losing almost all of our files, and the hard drives of that era were, by today&#39;s standards, flaky as hell. (If you heard your hard drive start to <em>click</em> , you panicked, and immediately began copying your most important files to another disk or disks.)</p><p> My grandparents&#39; generation lived through the Great Depression, and they wound up with, to my generation&#39;s eyes, very odd ideas about the availability and abundance of food. Many of the people who grew up in an era when food was profoundly scarce, wound up treating food as a scarcity for the remainder of their lives. They ate whatever was on their plate, whether they enjoyed it or not, and they were offended by anyone who didn&#39;t.</p><p> It&#39;s clear to me that I came of age in era of computing when storage was both scarce and unreliable. I like to think that I&#39;ve adapted with the times, especially given what I do for a living. I <em>know</em> how different storage is today — abundant, cheap, reliable — but I still have <em>feelings</em> about my data that are rooted in the distant past. <a href="#fnr5-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★可启动的Mac启动驱动器备份，另一种是Superduper</title></entry><entry><title> Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple&#39;s App Store </title><link href="https://x.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1886649436685693082" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w26" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41550</id><published> 2025-02-05T00:02:45Z</published><updated> 2025-02-06T22:48:15Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, on X:</p><blockquote><p>苹果在这里攻击欧盟时非常卑鄙。 The iOS App Store hosts the Reddit app, which provides access to massive amounts of porn.苹果知道这一点，允许它，并给了Reddit获得17+（!!!）评级和编辑选择奖。 [...]</p><p> As a recently deleted (by who?) post on the r/iOS subreddit explains, Apple&#39;s iOS App Store welcomes apps that host tons of porn, as Reddit does, as long as the majority of the content isn&#39;t porn, and the app has controls to hide the porn.</p></blockquote><p> Sweeney has a real point here, and it really is a bit of a conundrum. I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s alluding to with the “by who?” parenthetical, but I don&#39;t think one deleted Reddit thread on the topic was the result of Apple dispatching some Men in Black agents to knock on Reddit&#39;s door. Reddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/mt4l64/why_can_ios_apps_like_reddit_and_twitter_host/">full</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l03kt7/why_is_the_reddit_app_still_in_the_app_stores/">non-deleted</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/seu2zx/why_does_apple_ban_from_the_appstore_apps_like/">threads</a> from people asking variations of the same question. And the press has been covering the saga <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/reddit-ios-apps-disappear-nsfw-content/">for a decade</a> .</p><p> But how is it possible that these super popular platforms have apps in the no-porn App Store while hosting tons of porn? It&#39;s an issue with Reddit, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tumblr-adds-sensitive-content-filter-to-ios-app">with Tumblr</a> ( <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">times</a> ), and apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/04/x-twitter-porn-policy-under-18-opt-in">especially so with X</a> (fka Twitter). (I&#39;m not trying to feign prudishness here, but I&#39;ve heard, several times, that you really <em>don&#39;t</em> want to go looking for NSFW content on X because what you&#39;ll find is ... something.)</p><p> I think Sweeney&#39;s synopsis captures Apple&#39;s de facto policy accurately, with the exception that they don&#39;t <em>welcome</em> apps that host porn (so long as the app has controls to hide it, and if the adult content is effectively a side hustle in the overall context of the app), but <em>tolerate</em> it. It&#39;s a de facto policy of tolerating unadvertised pornographic content on platforms that are too big to ban from the App Store without generating far more of an outcry than any controversy over the side-hustle porn will.</p><p> Some banks are too big to fail. Some platforms are too big to ban. Apple won&#39;t say that, but that&#39;s clearly the tacit policy. It&#39;s not confusing that the exceptions are super popular apps — they are exceptions <em>because</em> they&#39;re super popular. And it&#39;s absolutely not a policy of looking the other way — Apple&#39;s policing of the situation is an enormous never-ending pain in the ass for the platforms involved. To see NSFW content in the iOS Reddit app, for example, you need to be signed in, <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061032831-How-do-I-view-NSFW-communities">and enable an off-by-default setting</a> . <a href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/potentially-mature-content/">Tumblr does similar</a> . You can&#39;t just download the Reddit or Tumblr apps from the App Store and innocuously find yourself viewing pornography.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple’s App Store’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> AltStore PAL Is Free of Charge, Thanks to &#39;MegaGrant&#39; From Epic Games </title><link href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w25" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/altstore-pal-epic" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41549</id><published> 2025-02-04T23:23:51Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T23:23:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/hot_tob_hardcore_porno_app_eu">in its media statement re: Hot Tub</a> (the you-have-to-admit-it&#39;s-a-fun-name hardcore porn app now available in the AltStore PAL alternative app marketplace in the EU), closed its statement with the following: “The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.”</p><p> On X, Epic CEO <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1886533813444207012">Tim Sweeney wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Contrary to Apple&#39;s false statement, the Epic Games Store doesn&#39;t carry this app, doesn&#39;t carry any porn apps, and has never carried porn apps.</p></blockquote><p> Epic Games does run <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">an alternative app marketplace for iOS in the EU</a> , and Sweeney is correct that neither Hot Tub, nor any other porno apps, are in it. But what Apple is alluding to here is Epic&#39;s financial backing of AltStore by way of an “ <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">Epic MegaGrant</a> ”. AltStore <a href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226">announced the grant back in August</a> :</p><blockquote><p> GOOD NEWS EU 🇪🇺 For innovation in app distribution, Epic Games has granted us a MegaGrant grant that we plan to use to cover Apple&#39;s Core Technology Fee going forward — and we won&#39;t take it for granted!</p><p>这是什么意思？ AltStore PAL is now FREE — no subscription necessary 🎉</p></blockquote><p> Prior to the grant, AltStore PAL charged €1.50 per installation to cover Apple&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a> , the rules for which have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=d0z8d8rx">gotten more complicated</a> since originally announced, but for app marketplaces themselves (like AltStore PAL) costs €0.50 per-user per-first-installation per-year.

<p>From <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/113940550587737112">an AltStore announcement yesterday</a> :</p><blockquote><p> iPhone turns 18 this year, which means it&#39;s finally old enough for some more ~mature~ apps…</p><p> Introducing Hot Tub by c1d3r, the world&#39;s 1st Apple-approved porn app!</p></blockquote><p> The screenshots and video previews are blurred-for-obfuscation by default, but <a href="https://hottubapp.io/">Hot Tub&#39;s website</a> makes pretty clear that the content it aggregates is serious porn. Figuratively speaking, they&#39;re not fucking around. Literally speaking, that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re aggregating — including an in-app “teens” channel.</p><p> Describing Hot Tub as “Apple-approved” is cheeky, if we&#39;re being generous, and downright misleading if we&#39;re not.他们的意思是，热水浴缸​​被苹果（Apple）适当公证 - 表面上是技术性的，而不是社论，其中涵盖了（使用<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">苹果自己的文档中的</a>术语）精度，功能，安全性，安全性和隐私。 I say “ostensibly” there because Apple has, controversially, refused to notarize apps for other reasons, including in November <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">when it rejected for notarization the classic Mac emulator Mini vMac</a> , on the grounds that Mini vMac both violated Apple&#39;s software licensing terms and misused Apple&#39;s商标。</p><p> But pornography has pretty much always been Apple&#39;s canonical example for the sort of content they do not want in the App Store, and thus — because Apple&#39;s stance is that the App Store ought to be the sole source for consumer software for iOS — the sort of content they do not consider appropriate for native apps. You&#39;ve been able to watch porno on your iPhone since the first day it shipped — a full year ahead of the App Store — by using the web. Apple&#39;s line has always been clear: native apps = Apple-approved; the web = anything goes. (That same line goes for payment processing for digital goods and services as well.)</p><p> Back in 2010, MG Siegler (then at TechCrunch) reported on an email exchange between Steve Jobs and customer Matthew Browing. Browing wrote to Jobs:</p><blockquote><p> It appears that more and more Apple is determining for its consumers what content they should be able to receive. For instance, the blocking of Mark Fiore&#39;s comic app (due to being political satire) or blocking of what Apple considers to be porn.</p><p> I&#39;m all for keeping porn out of kids hands. Heck — I&#39;m all for ensuring that I don&#39;t have to see it unless I want to. But… that&#39;s what parental controls are for. Put these types of apps into categories and allow them to be blocked by their parents should they want to.</p><p> Apple&#39;s role isn&#39;t moral police — Apple&#39;s role is to design and produce really cool gadgets that do what the consumer wants them to do.</p></blockquote><p> Jobs responded:</p><blockquote><p> Fiore&#39;s app will be in the store shortly.那是一个错误。 However, we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone. Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.</p></blockquote><p> (The man knew how to write an email.)</p><p> Fast-forward to the present, and Apple has been citing pornography as one of its reasons for adamantly opposing the EU&#39;s DMA from the very beginning. Last year, after the DMA went into effect, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">FastCompany&#39;s Michael Grothaus interviewed App Store chief Phil Schiller</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Schiller is quick to point out that despite these new security measures, there are limits to the protections that Apple can provide to users who allow alternative app marketplaces to operate on their iPhones. The company has virtually no control over the content of apps from those marketplaces — even if that content is objectionable or harmful.</p><p> “Ultimately, there are things that we have not allowed on our App Store — things that we didn&#39;t think would be safe or appropriate,” Schiller says. “It will not be our decision whether those other marketplaces have the same terms and limitations.”</p><p> So yes, for the first time, apps dedicated to pornography can be run on the iPhone. This should be something parents are aware of, because the DMA does not give Apple the legal right to forbid certain types of app stores from operating on its platform, nor does Apple have the ability to prevent a child from downloading such an app store onto their iPhone。</p></blockquote><p> And, lastly, with regard to Hot Tub and AltStore in particular, Apple issued this statement to media outlets, including Daring Fireball, yesterday:</p><blockquote><p> We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids. This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world. Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store. The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.</p></blockquote><p> So, no, Apple neither approves of Hot Tub in particular, nor the ability to distribute native porn apps in general. Everyone involved with both AltStore and Hot Tub knows this, but they also know that framing it this way — the announcement came with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/introducing-hot-tub-banner.png">this banner graphic</a> promoting Hot Tub as “The First Apple-Approved Porn App” — is a good way to <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250203/p16#a250203p16">get headlines</a> . (The Verge: “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604937/iphone-ios-porn-app-hot-tub-altstore-pal-eu">The First &#39;Approved&#39; iPhone Porn App Is Coming to Europe</a> ” — which aside from the mild clickbait slant, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">misleadingly conflates “Europe” with “the EU”</a> .) But there&#39;s some undeniable <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/02/schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> seeing Apple on the wrong end <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">of notarization being used as a tool to convey subject-matter approval</a> . [ <strong>Update:</strong> And now <a href="https://www.threads.net/@altstoreio/post/DFqg4vfy7B4">it&#39;s become a thing</a> , where AltStore is sticking to their guns that Hot Tub, having been notarized, is thus “approved” by Apple. C&#39;mon.]</p><p> If we want to get nitty-gritty over verbs, I&#39;d argue that Apple <em>accepts</em> apps — like Hot Tub — for notarization, not <em>approves</em> . Begrudging <em>acceptance</em> is more of a thing than begrudging <em>approval</em> .</p><p> But, as Apple itself emphasizes in its statement, the DMA requires them to allow it. I&#39;ve seen no celebratory <a href="https://x.com/teresaribera">tweets</a> or <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/home/en">announcements from European Commission officials</a> celebrating the availability of Hot Tub. Just crickets chirping. When it comes to native iOS porn apps, the EU now has an unequivocal advantage over not just the United States but the rest of the world. You&#39;d think they&#39;d want to celebrate the achievement.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;Hot Tub&#39;, a Hardcore Porn App for iOS, Hits AltStore in the EU</title></entry><entry><title>抖动</title><link href="https://dithering.fm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w23" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/dithering" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41547</id><published> 2025-02-04T18:09:14Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T18:09:15Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The LBJ Presidential Library, regarding a largely ad-libbed address Lyndon Johnson gave to a group of 150 non-incumbent Democratic candidates for Congress in 1966:</p><blockquote><p> He talked about the difference between Republicans and Democrats: “We&#39;re for something, and they are against everything.

Is it the tariff?&#39;</p><p> “&#39;不。&#39;</p><p> “&#39;Well, what is the difference?&#39;</p><p> “先生。 Rayburn replied, &#39;I&#39;ll tell you the easiest and best explanation — one that I have observed, and I came here during Woodrow Wilson&#39;s administration. They hate all of our Presidents.&#39;</p><p> “He said, &#39;I didn&#39;t hate Harding. I felt sorry for him, but I didn&#39;t hate him.&#39; He said, &#39;I didn&#39;t hate Coolidge. I thought he was totally inadequate to the responsibility, but I used to go down and eat scrambled eggs and just watch him. He never said anything. You couldn&#39;t tell what he thought of anything.&#39;</p><p> “He said, &#39;I didn&#39;t get angry with Hoover. Everything in the country folded up and we had bread lines all over the country and everybody in the Southwest was chasing rabbits in order to eat. But I didn&#39;t hate him. We tried to help him. But look what they did to Roosevelt when he came in. They were after his wife. They were after his daughter. And they finally got down after his dog.&#39;”</p><p> And LBJ pointed toward the South Lawn where his beagles were kept and said: “And I&#39;ve got three of them out there to jump on if they want to.”</p><p> He talked about the difference between constructive action and obstructive action: “Any jackass can kick a barn down.

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat">Speaking of books</a> , Simon &amp; Schuster announced a new one:</p><blockquote><p> Apple isn&#39;t just a brand; it&#39;s the world&#39;s most valuable company and creator of the twenty-first century&#39;s defining product. The iPhone has revolutionized the way we live, work and connect. But Apple is now a victim of its own success, caught in the middle of a new Cold War between two superpowers.</p><p> On the brink of bankruptcy in 1996, Apple launched a new strategy to outsource its manufacturing. After experimenting in eight countries, nearly all of its operations were lured to China by the promises of affordable, ubiquitous labour. As the iPod and iPhone transformed Apple&#39;s fortunes, their sophisticated production played a seminal role financing, training, supervising, and supplying Chinese manufacturers — skills Beijing is now weaponizing against the West.</p><p> <em>Apple in China</em> is the sometimes disturbing and always revelatory story of how an outspoken, proud company that once praised “rebels” and “troublemakers” — the company that encouraged us all to “Think Different” — devolved into a silent, passive partner to a belligerent regime that increasingly controls its fate.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve long been a fan of McGee&#39;s work as the Financial Times&#39;s Silicon Valley correspondent.

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">Speaking of cheating</a> , my favorite book from Trump&#39;s first term was Rick Reilly&#39;s <em>Commander in Cheat</em> , which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/09/commander-in-cheat">I linked to</a> , with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/02/donald-trump-golf-28-club-championships">an excerpt still available at The Guardian</a> , when it came out in 2019.

<p>Drew Harwell, at The Washington Post (gift link, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lguxbx6fgc25">via Harwell himself on Bluesky</a> — which seemingly uses a ludicrously long 397-character token in the URL):</p><blockquote><p> But after poring over his live-streamed gameplay, online sleuths recently made a shocking accusation: Musk had cheated. They suspected that he had pursued a widely mocked tactic known as “boosting,” paying strangers to play his character and rake in loot so that, when he logged in, he could face challenges with the most powerful gear.</p><p> Musk fought the allegations before ultimately confessing in messages this month. “It&#39;s impossible to beat players in Asia if you don&#39;t,” he wrote. A few days later, his character could be seen chasing treasure through the game&#39;s sulfuric caverns while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/billionaires-trump-inauguration-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/">Musk was in the Capitol Rotunda, attending President Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Every cheater&#39;s story is the same: “ <em>I&#39;m not cheating, and I&#39;m offended you&#39;d accuse me.</em> ” Then, presented with incontrovertible proof, “ <em>I had to cheat because everyone else is cheating so it&#39;s the only way to win, and anyone who isn&#39;t doing it is a simp.</em> ” But the simple truth is that cheaters are rotten people, and most people naturally despise cheating.</p><blockquote><p> But watching Musk&#39;s streams, Jake began to suspect foul play. The billionaire did amateurish things, such as failing to drink mana flasks when he needed them and trying to pick up items when his inventory was full. And he made comments that struck devoted players as clueless, saying, for instance, that his character&#39;s “Hand of Wisdom and Action” gloves, which rank among the game&#39;s most valuable items, “could be better.” A normal gamer could write these off as simple flubs in the heat of battle, Jake said. But Musk was supposedly a global grand master, and gamers at that level don&#39;t make these kinds of mistakes.</p><p> “It&#39;s like if you said you&#39;re the number two truck driver in the world … and when you try to get the truck to turn on, the windshield wipers start going,” Jake said. “It just felt like there was no way this guy did this.”</p><p> When Jake posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1hwxc17/documenting_the_saga_of_elon_musks_account/">thread</a> on Reddit documenting Musk&#39;s “suspicious” gameplay, the accusations kicked up a firestorm, with “Path of Exile 2” fans scraping through the streams Musk had posted to X for clues of what some were calling his <a href="https://x.com/Diamonte916/status/1878047536336052365">“stolen valor.透明</a>[...]</p><p> By paying someone else to earn him his high-level gear, they said, he had removed most of the challenge — only to boast how quickly he had beaten others who played fair and square. One poster on a Diablo subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1hxi3vh/gamers_are_accusing_elon_musk_of_cheating_at/">called</a> it “unbelievably pathetic” that the world&#39;s richest man would feel “the need to cheat” in a video game to “claim he is good at something” most people “couldn&#39;t care less about.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s the boasting that&#39;s most revealing.</p><p> It&#39;s a trope as old as fiction itself that villains cheat at everything. Auric Goldfinger cheated at golf, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBvu-fTTIk">famously</a> . And in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moonraker-James-Bond-Ian-Fleming/dp/1612185452/?tag=df-amzn-20">Ian Fleming&#39;s <em>Moonraker</em></a> (but not the movie), the whole plot was driven by M&#39;s suspicion that mysterious millionaire (the billionaire of the 1950s) industrialist Hugo Drax was cheating at cards at their gentlemen&#39;s club. He assigned Bond to figure out how he was cheating, and Bond stumbled into Drax&#39;s plot to annihilate London. Drax, you see, is in fact a Nazi. And his industry: rocketry.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Elon Musk Cheats at Video Games’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Don&#39;t Believe Him&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/dont-believe-him" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41542</id><published> 2025-02-03T15:37:24Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T17:27:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ezra Klein in an audio essay/transcribed column at The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> That is the tension at the heart of Trump&#39;s whole strategy: Trump is acting like a king because he is too weak to govern like a president.他正试图将感知代替现实。他希望感知成为现实。只有当我们相信他时，这种情况才会发生。 [...]</p><p>特朗普希望您在所有这项活动中看到的是命令。在所有这些活动中，真正的是混乱。他们没有一些秘密的焦点库，而我们其余的人则没有。 They have convinced themselves that speed and force is a strategy unto itself — that it is, in a sense, a replacement for a real strategy.不相信他们。</p></blockquote><p> It is easy and quick, often instantaneous, to destroy things. It is hard and slow work to build new things, and often even harder and slower work to improve existing ones.</p><blockquote><p>几个月前，我与知道联邦政府如何工作以及任何活着的人进行对话。我问他，如果他看到特朗普这样做，他最让他担心。他告诉我的是，如果特朗普慢慢走，他最担心。如果他通过做使他更受欢迎并使反对派变得更虚弱和困惑的事情开始任期。如果他试图为中期增强力量，同时慢慢扩大自己的力量并在最弱的深处占领。</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s the optimistic take — Trump and his new administration are trying to manically (or is it maniacally?) punch their way to a first-round knockout. They&#39;re utterly unprepared for a 15-round grueling slog. The pessimistic take is that the first-round knockout might happen.</p><p> The ultimate power in America isn&#39;t our political or legal systems. It&#39;s our culture. Our collective attitudes. We, collectively, are quite obviously very bad at history, because we, collectively, clearly forgot how chaotic a Trump presidency is <em>after just four years</em> , and we forgot how much we dislike chaotic leadership.

<p>Parker Ortolani:</p><blockquote><p> Mastodon clients have become the new UI playground in the same way that Twitter clients used to be. But what I can&#39;t wrap my head around is the business decision of developers to lean into Mastodon clients versus Bluesky ones. Fortunately some progress seems to be starting to be made with apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740792786">PinkSky</a> that replicate the Instagram experience but using Bluesky as the backend. There are also a handful of clients like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6466340923">Skeets</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graysky-a-bluesky-client/id6448234181">GraySky</a> , but nothing that approaches the quality of some Mastodon clients or the legendary Twitter clients of old. They&#39;re okay, but they&#39;re not worth dropping the official client. Other apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1666230916">OpenVibe</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485">Reeder</a> are designed to combine feeds from multiple services and they do work with Bluesky. But they&#39;re not dedicated clients. I want Tweetbot or Twitterrific, but for Bluesky. I&#39;m not seeing that yet. The opportunity is clearly there, it has tens of millions of users making it three times the size of Mastodon.</p></blockquote><p> One thing all the existing nascent Bluesky clients lack is timeline position saving/sync — so when you leave the app and come back later (with sync, even on a different device) you can pick up reading exactly where you left off. I find it hard to imagine paying for a Bluesky client that didn&#39;t do this.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> About a month ago, Skeets developer Sebastian Vogelsang <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skeetsapp.com/post/3lfa32kfctc26">posted a thread about running into API limitations</a> trying to implement position-saving, a feature that&#39;s in beta, and available to Skeets Pro users.

<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">Editors note from The New Republic</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As The New Republic <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/191007/la-times-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trump">reported on Friday</a> , The Los Angeles Times — currently in a race to the bottom <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/188445/washington-post-bezos-trump-failure">with The Washington Post</a> to determine which of the two venerable institutions can sell out to Donald Trump the hardest — found itself in a fresh controversy after contributor Eric Reinhart accused the paper of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">making significant edits</a> to a piece of his that was largely critical of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. into one that depicted the president&#39;s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services with an “optimistic tone,” largely “suggesting that the virulent conspiracy theorist could be an answer and solution to the American public&#39;s bubbling resentment toward the health care industry.”</p><p> Reinhart exposed the shady goings-on on X (fka Twitter). “Editing out the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author&#39;s clear intent is pretty shitty,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericreinhart.bsky.social/post/3lh2ell45722u">he wrote</a> . In light of this lamentable journalistic malpractice, The New Republic has agreed to run Reinhart&#39;s piece as he intended it to be read.</p></blockquote><p> Reinhart&#39;s headline at TNR, encapsulating the intended thrust of his piece: “ <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">RFK Jr&#39;s Wrecking Ball Won&#39;t Fix Public Health</a> ”, and the closing paragraph of the column:</p><blockquote><p> Although RFK, Jr., and Luigi Mangione are both responses to the same underlying problem of US healthcare corruption, there is a major difference between them: one allegedly operated outside the law to kill one person in defense of millions, whereas the other — via his egomaniacal <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">disregard</a> for scientific evidence — seeks to use law itself to inflict preventable death on those millions.</p></blockquote><p> The headline the LA Times ran his piece under, after their editing: “ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">Trump&#39;s Healthcare Disruption Could Pay Off — if He Pushes Real Reform</a> ”, and its closing paragraphs:</p><blockquote><p> Such an approach would shift us away from overreliance on expensive medical treatments and toward public health as it should be: a project by and for <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/152/4/245/118232/Empowering-the-Extra-Ordinary">the people</a> that makes full use of government resources to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/02/24/fixing-public-health-systems-revolution-physicians-take-backseat/">empower communities</a> .</p><p> We should demand fundamental transformations in how we approach health in America, but a wrecking ball alone won&#39;t deliver what we need.</p></blockquote><p> After all the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post">shenanigans</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/owner-patrick-soon-shiong-is-tanking-the-la-times">Soon-Shiong began pulling</a> pre- <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/soon-shiong-la-times">and post-election</a> , my only question here is whether Reinhart really believed the LA Times op-ed page was going to run his piece as written.</p><h2> Super-Nerdy Bonus Material</h2><p> My original intention for this post ended above. I wanted to quote the TNR editors note that explained the situation, quote Reinhart&#39;s intended headline and closing paragraph, and contrast those with the benign gibberish headline and closing that the LA Times actually published.完毕。 But I&#39;ve got more. Turns out, the LA Times itself effectively published <em>proof</em> of its “editing” that completely perverted Reinhart&#39;s intended thrust.</p><p> I have a small arsenal of homegrown tools I use to automate the work of writing DF. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> itself is the crown jewel of them. But over the now many years I&#39;ve been doing this I&#39;ve created a whole toolbox of scripts and macros that help me do what I do faster and with fewer errors. (And I still commit plenty of errors.) One of the smaller ones that I&#39;ve never shared publicly (but probably <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/">should</a> ) is a Keyboard Maestro macro that lets me select a range of text in Safari and copy that selection as Markdown-formatted文本。 It picks up spans of italics and boldfacing, but most importantly, it picks up hyperlinks in the original text and converts them to the Markdown link style I prefer ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">defined reference links</a> ).</p><p> You will note in my blockquote above of Reinhart&#39;s intended closing paragraph, as published at The New Republic, he linked the word “disregard” to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">this January 28 report from The Washington Post</a> : “RFK Jr. Disparaged Vaccines Dozens of Times in Recent Years and Made Baseless Claims on Race”. No link to that Washington Post report appears, visually, in the butchered version of Reinhart&#39;s piece that ran in the LA Times.</p><p> But, my “Copy Markdown Blockquote” macro picked up an effectively invisible-to-the-user link to that article, in the HTML markup between their closing paragraph and Reinhart&#39;s author bio beneath it. You can view source at the LA Times website and see for yourself, but here&#39;s a screenshot:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/la-times-reinhart-html-screenshot.png" class="noborder"><img

<p>Alex Heath, writing at The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Moments after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s all-hands comments to employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/603754/mark-zuckerberg-tells-employees-to-buckle-up-in-leaked-all-hands-meeting">were widely leaked</a> , a company executive warned in an internal memo that leakers will be fired.</p><p> “We take leaks seriously and will take action,” Meta&#39;s chief information security officer, Guy Rosen, said in an internal memo I&#39;ve seen. [...] Rosen goes on to say that Meta “will take appropriate action, including termination” if it identifies leakers and that “we recently terminated relationships with employees who leaked confidential company information inappropriately and exfiltrated sensitive documents.”</p><p> During today&#39;s all-hands meeting, Zuckerberg told employees he would no longer be as transparent due to leaks. “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks,” he said. “It sucks.”</p></blockquote><p> Just about every well-run and successful company I&#39;m aware of fires leakers. Or really it&#39;s the opposite: it&#39;s difficult to succeed as a company with no institutional trust between employees. But company cultures are infused by the personalities of their founders. Meta employees have no scruples surrounding the privacy of internal communications because, by definition, they&#39;re the sort of people who never saw any problem with Meta&#39;s complete lack of regard for such things. So they don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lgykn4gqmk2v">leak what they don&#39;t like</a> . Zuck gets no loyalty because he hired an entire company of people with no convictions other than “winning” or whatever it really is that Meta sees as its central tenet.</p><p> It&#39;s not fear of getting fired that keeps employees at most companies from leaking. It&#39;s that they find themselves aligned with the company&#39;s mission. They feel like part of a team that they want to see succeed, and they naturally adopt an attitude of being a team player. Team players don&#39;t leak the playbook because they don&#39;t like the coach&#39;s play-calling or how much playing time they&#39;re getting. I&#39;ve never gotten the sense that that sort of attitude exists at Meta.</p><p> This is a company that bought a popular VPN app (Onavo) and then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat">used it to snoop on users&#39; encrypted SnapChat traffic</a> . They used it <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/10/facebook-copycatting">to snoop on users to determine the popularity of WhatsApp before purchasing it</a> . This wasn&#39;t some rogue operation in a corner of the company — it was a core strategic asset that led directly to a $20 billion acquisition. Onavo was just flat-out spyware and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/22/facebook-onavo-app-store">Apple kicked it out of the App Store in 2018</a> . For years — years — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/29/facebook-teens-vpn">Meta paid users aged 13–35 up to $20 a month to install a “Facebook Research” app</a> that let Meta study every single thing they did on their phones. An app like that couldn&#39;t be distributed through the App Store, of course, so Meta distributed it by abusing the iOS “enterprise” developer program; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facebook-and-google-offered-gift-cards-for-root-level-access-to-ios-users-data/">when Apple pulled Meta&#39;s enterprise certificate over the fiasco</a> , its employees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/30/apple-disables-facebook-internal-apps/">couldn&#39;t use their own internal apps to buy food or take a company shuttle bus</a> .</p><p> It would be a wonder if the sort of people who would do stuff like that — or go to work at a company that does things like that — were <em>not</em> incorrigible leakers of embarrassing information and communications. Zuck&#39;s exasperation over the disloyalty of his own employees is like hiring a team of pickpockets and then complaining that sandwiches keep going missing from the gang&#39;s hangout fridge.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Perfect Headline: ‘Meta Warns That It Will Fire Leakers in Leaked Memo’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/meta-warns-leakers-in-leaked-memo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The WSJ on Zuckerberg&#39;s $25 Million Payoff to Trump </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?st=mqxsa5&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/wsj-suck-trump-payoff" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41535</id><published> 2025-01-31T20:53:30Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T20:53:31Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Annie Linskey and Rebecca Ballhaus, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p><blockquote><p> “It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said in a statement. “After Meta pays to play, what does Mark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?”</p><p> Serious talks about the suit, which had seen little activity since fall 2023, began after Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s chief executive, flew to Trump&#39;s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to dine with him in November, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The dinner was one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the relationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump&#39;s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump warned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the election against him.</p><p> Toward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of the lawsuit, the people said. The president signaled that the litigation had to be resolved before Zuckerberg could be “brought into the tent,” one of the people said.</p></blockquote><p> A good reminder that self respect has no price tag.</p><blockquote><p> Weeks later, in early January, Zuckerberg returned to Mar-a-Lago for a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerberg-meta-trump-pivot-392e4a3f?mod=article_inline">full day of mediation</a> . Trump was present for part of the session, though he stepped out at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-sentencing-hush-money-new-york-9f9282bc?mod=article_inline">one point to be sentenced</a> — appearing virtually — for covering up hush money paid to a porn star, one of the people said. He also golfed, reappearing in golf clothes and talking about the round he had just played, the person said.</p></blockquote><p> Even when you own the golf course and <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/trump-drives-golf-cart-onto-green/">drive your cart right onto the green</a> like a jackass, an 18-hole round of golf still takes like three hours.

<p>Via David Smith on Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113923389557198608">who writes</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The recent work I&#39;ve been doing has required a lot of sharing files between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the ideal tool for this but I&#39;ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p><p> Instead I&#39;ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop alternative and it&#39;s been working fantastically. The only real downside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the share to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that&#39;s a tradeoff I&#39;ll happily make.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow I&#39;d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It&#39;s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229">in the App Store</a> and <a href="https://localsend.org/download">via the web</a> . No middleman in the cloud — transfers are peer-to-peer, and the whole project is <a href="https://localsend.org/community">open source with an active community on GitHub</a> .</p><p> When I dick around with my Android burner phone, I often find myself sorely missing AirDrop and Continuity. Sometimes I just want to move the contents of my clipboard from one device to the other — LocalSend makes that easier than anything else I&#39;ve seen.</p><p> I&#39;m not even sure Smith&#39;s “downside” is really a downside. I understand why AirDrop works the way it does (always-on in the background), but I wouldn&#39;t want LocalSend to work that way. I <em>like</em> the explicitness of opening it on both devices.</p><p> Just an outstanding project from developer Tien Do Nam.

<p>路透社的周一报告是在《卫报》上联合的：“微软正在谈论特朗普声称的提克托克”：</p><blockquote><p>唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）建议，微软正在谈判收购Tiktok，他希望看到对该应用程序的竞标战。当被问及微软是否正在谈论购买该应用程序时，美国总统说：“我会说是”，并补充说：“对Tiktok非常感兴趣。 Tiktok非常感兴趣。”</p><p>在周一美国总统对空军一号的记者发表评论之后，微软，蒂克托克和bytedance并未立即回应路透社在常规营业时间之外发表评论的要求。</p><p>报道的谈判标志着微软第二次在框架中获取Tiktok。在他的第一任期中，特朗普命令蒂克托克（Tiktok）以国家安全问题为由将其美国版本与兽人分开。微软在2020年成为高级投标人，但谈判很快崩溃了，几个月后，特朗普的撤资推动力结束了。</p></blockquote><p> Microsoft正在谈判从Bytedance获取Tiktok的谈话真的吗？还是唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）只是胡扯他的“我会说是”？ This report, based on nothing more than an off-the-cuff verbal answer from Trump Monday, has had absolutely zero follow-up since. Microsoft reported its quarterly earnings yesterday and there was not a word about a TikTok acquisition. And in the years since 2020, Microsoft has invested a staggering amount of capital into data centers for AI and cloud computing — their $22 billion spend last quarter and estimated $80 billion spend for the upcoming year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/microsoft-earnings-stock.html">dominated news coverage</a> and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">analysis</a> of their results yesterday.他们还以约700亿美元的价格<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">收购了Activision Blizzard</a> 。 I&#39;m not saying Microsoft couldn&#39;t afford to acquire TikTok — they could, I&#39;m sure — but it&#39;d raise a genuine question about focus. But there&#39;s <em>nothing</em> <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">in the coverage of yesterday&#39;s results</a> or the analyst call they held that suggests they&#39;re in the hunt for TikTok.</p><p> Whether you love Trump or hate him (or, bizarrely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">somehow fall in-between</a> — please see me after class if you&#39;re of that mind) we all know he&#39;s a bullshitter. He makes shit up. Either (a) there are secret talks between Microsoft and ByteDance, and Trump is privy to those talks, and he decided to blab about them, but only when asked; or (b) he just said “I would say yes” when asked because he thought it would sound good and reinforce his self image as the world&#39;s most juiced-in dealmaker. I know which seems more likely.</p><p> And even if it&#39;s <em>not</em> bullshit, if all a news report has to go on is Donald Trump saying “I would say yes”, that <em>has</em> to be filed under “Maybe this is true” <em>at best</em> .

<p>引人入胜的话题 - 几乎完全是关于出于明显原因的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">炎症话题</a>的现象。 These are mapping and metadata nerds approaching the dilemma in the very nerdiest of ways.我发现它相当舒缓，而且内容丰富，尤其是<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Minh%20Nguyen">MinhNguyễn</a>的帖子，他似乎是OpenStreetMap超级用户。<a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/55">第一的</a>：</p><blockquote><p>因此，事实证明，Ungegn实际上并不是个人倾向的决策权。他们的作用是鼓励和促进标准化。他们从字面上发布了<a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/wgGuidelines.html">有关准则的准则</a>。 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265039137_The_Naming_of_Maritime_Features_Viewed_from_an_International_Law_Perspective">在国际法中，</a>最接近海湾名称的权威是国际水文组织。自1953年以来，IHO<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_Oceans_and_Seas"><em>对海洋和海洋的极限</em></a>及时冻结，没有任何更新，这显然是因为日本和韩国无法就海上分开的海上同意。也许某个交易商可以把他们带到议价表…</p></blockquote><p> My kneejerk reaction to Trump&#39;s “Gulf of America” executive order was that mapmakers should just roll their eyes, make the jerk-off motion, and ignore it.但这是不切实际的。地图制造商试图诉诸姓名的权威。还有什么选择？ That Google and Apple (and OpenStreetMaps) serve as their own authorities on the names of topographical features and geographical points of interest?那是不对的。 So you might think, well, the Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water, so the mapmakers should appeal to an international authority.联合国！但是正如Nguyễn所引用的那样，这并不是联合国关于地理名称的专家群体所做的。</p><p> <a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/87">Another post in the thread from Nguyễn</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Ironically, Spanish-language media <a href="https://elpais.com/us/2025-01-21/de-golfo-de-mexico-a-golfo-de-america-trump-renombra-el-mapa-aunque-con-improbables-consecuencias-internacionales.html/">keeps having to explain</a> why <em>Gulf of America</em> is problematic in English. In Spanish, <em>América</em> refers to the Americas as a whole, not the US specifically. If one didn&#39;t know any better, one would think it&#39;s a gift to Cuba! Of course, this doesn&#39;t justify the attempt to rename the gulf, since the intention is abundantly clear, but it does leave the name vulnerable to others reclaiming it for themselves. A more erudite politician might&#39;ve chosen <em>Gulf of Florida</em> , which at least has a historical basis, dating to around the same time as <em>Gulf of Mexico</em> .但是我们在这里。</p></blockquote><p> And from yet another post by Nguyễn, a link to <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12881">this new report on the order&#39;s implications for the entire federal government</a> from the Congressional Research Service (a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress). Now we&#39;ve gotten more good nerds involved: librarians. And whatever the answer is, it&#39;s complicated.</p><p> I don&#39;t like this ostensible renaming (rebranding?) of the Gulf of Mexico any more than you do. It&#39;s petty and pointless, except for the trolling spite, which, of course, <em>is</em> the point. I don&#39;t know what Apple is going to do, but I suspect, ultimately, if the Department of the Interior really does make this official, Apple Maps will follow suit, but perhaps with something like “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” for users in the US.</p><p> Google should have simply done what Apple is doing, though, and remained utterly silent on the issue until and if it&#39;s actually made official. Best thing we can hope for is that the Department of the Interior stalls on making the change in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and that Trump forgets about it by then.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘OpenStreetMap Community Discussion on How to Handle the U.S. Federal Government’s Imminent Designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘Gulf of America’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/29/open-street-map-gulf-of-mexico">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/repebble" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1l" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41529</id><published> 2025-01-29T21:57:23Z</published><updated> 2025-01-30T22:05:11Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The whole tech world needs more projects that aren&#39;t trying to become billion- (let alone trillion-) dollar ideas, but are happily shooting for success as million-dollar ideas (or less!). </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Here&#39;s an addendum to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">my post yesterday</a> on the recent shake-up atop the generally stable “top free downloads” list in the App Store. Some of the shake-up is from new entrants, like the much-ballyhooed AI chatbot DeepSeek. But a lot of it is the direct result of the sudden absence of ByteDance&#39;s entire lineup of apps: TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap. Alternatives are vying to fill those voids. [ <strong>Update, one day later:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/marvel-snap-returns-to-app-store/">Marvel Snap is back in the App Store</a> , because it now has a new publisher.]</p><p> TikTok returning to operational service in the US <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">after an outage of just one day</a> has squelched the outrage surrounding its ban. The app stopped working; TikTok users, unprepared for its ban, freaked out; the app started working again the next day; and TikTok fans more or less went back to scrolling their feeds and shut up. Controversy over.</p><p> But the controversy shouldn&#39;t be over. And unless something changes, it&#39;s going to slowly simmer back to an eventual boil.</p><p> Nobody is really talking about the fact that ByteDance apps remain banned, legally speaking, in the US right now, and already-installed copies of their apps are only continuing to function because TikTok&#39;s US cloud providers, Oracle and Akamai, restored service on the word of President Trump that they won&#39;t be held accountable for doing so, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">despite being in clear violation of the PAFACA Act</a> . But neither Apple nor Google has restored any of ByteDance&#39;s apps to the App Store or Play Store. That hasn&#39;t interfered with TikTok going back to operational via copies of the app already installed on users&#39; phones, but it&#39;s an insurmountable — although incremental — problem in the long run.</p><p> The conventional wisdom is that Oracle and Akamai are being a bit reckless (“ <em>If Trump says we&#39;re good, we&#39;re good — what could go wrong, it&#39;s not like Trump has ever changed his mind...</em> ”) and Apple and Google are prudent, more staid (“ <em>We&#39;re following the letter of the law and will continue to follow the letter of the law</em> ”). And perhaps that&#39;s all there is to this. But now that we&#39;re over a week into this post-ban period, I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s purely a coincidence that these four companies split along these lines. The two cloud providers required for TikTok to function on one side, the two app store providers on the other.</p><p> With TikTok&#39;s cloud provider access shut off, it was like a guillotine. TikTok was working for everyone in the US, then boom, it was shut down for everyone. Then, just as suddenly, it was back.</p><p> Being locked out of the App Store and Play Store, on the other hand, is a slow squeeze. The first thing that comes to mind, obviously, is no new users. No growth. TikTok already has a mind-boggling number of users in the US (estimates seem to range from 120 to 170 million), but no growth is no growth.</p><p> The second thing that comes to mind is no app updates for US users. No new features. No bug fixes. No security patches. TikTok, like most popular apps, typically pushes updates to the App Store and Play Store every two or three weeks. What happens now that that&#39;s stopped for US users? Is ByteDance still going to push app updates to users in the rest of the world? TikTok obviously has a lot of American users but <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/data-drop-5-charts-on-tiktoks-growth-asia-pacific"><em>most</em> of its users live elsewhere</a> .</p><p> But the third factor is the most insidious: even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user&#39;s phone continues to function, that user can&#39;t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance&#39;s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores. Wipe and restore your phone from backup? No more TikTok.购买新手机？ No TikTok on the new phone.</p><p> Trump&#39;s reprieve was a declaration that the Justice Department wouldn&#39;t enforce the law for 75 days. If ByteDance doesn&#39;t sell TikTok — and it sure doesn&#39;t seem like they have any more intention to sell it now than they did before the ban took effect — what happens? <em>Another</em> (even more shambolically illegal) Trump extension that only keeps TikTok functioning, but not available in the app stores? Because the other side isn&#39;t budging either: China hawks like Senator Tom Cotton <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/speeches/icymi-cotton-objects-to-tiktok-ban-extension">have not shifted an inch</a> . They&#39;re tolerating Trump&#39;s 75-day reprieve but not budging from their overall “sell or you&#39;re banned” stance.</p><p> I&#39;m not saying this is a backroom plot between the administration and these companies, but I&#39;m not saying it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a backroom agreement either. Trump isn&#39;t complaining about Apple and Google not getting on board. And neither Apple nor Google seems worried about Trump&#39;s wrath for not following Oracle and Akamai&#39;s leads. The goal of the legislation isn&#39;t to pull the plug on TikTok for Americans — it&#39;s to pressure ByteDance (and really, their bosses in the Chinese Communist Party) into selling the app. Instantly banning TikTok&#39;s US operations resulted in instant and vociferous outrage from TikTok users — the pressure turned out not to be on ByteDance and the CCP, it was on the US government to give people back their beloved TikTok. So I think everyone on the US side is looking at the current detente — TikTok being available to existing users through existing copies of the app, but not being available in app stores — as a way to turn the pressure up only on ByteDance. Slowly strangle TikTok over a period of months, rather than behead it overnight.</p><p> But what happens if the CCP stands pat? If they just wait it out? If ByteDance were a normal company they&#39;d face financial pressure to capitulate and sell. But the CCP isn&#39;t under any financial pressure to allow ByteDance to sell. Say what you will about the Chinese government, but they do not lack for patience. What happens then, when word starts spreading amongst TikTok fans not to upgrade their phones, lest they lose access to the app? Apple&#39;s going to have some strong feelings about that.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ My Spitball Theory on TikTok&#39;s Current Semi-Reprieve in the US</title></entry><entry><title> Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to &#39;Gulf of America&#39;, for American Users Only </title><link href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41526</id><published> 2025-01-29T01:00:22Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T22:12:57Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Google, in an announcement on X:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps.

When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the US quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.</p><p> Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name.世界其他人都看到两个名字。 That applies here too.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-reclassifies-us-as-sensitive-country-like-china-russia-.html">Jennifer Elias, reporting for CNBC</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google&#39;s maps division on Monday reclassified the US as a “sensitive country,” a designation it reserves for states with strict governments and border disputes, CNBC has learned. [...]</p><p> Some team members within the maps division were ordered to urgently make changes to the location name and recategorize the US from “non-sensitive” to “sensitive,” according to the internal correspondence. The changes were given a rare “P0” order, meaning it had the highest priority level and employees were immediately notified and instructed to drop what they were doing to work on it.</p><p> Google&#39;s order states that the Gulf of America title change should be treated similar to the Persian Gulf, which in Arab countries is displayed on Google Maps as Arabian Gulf.</p></blockquote><p> No word from Apple on how Apple Maps will handle this. (I&#39;ve asked for comment; will update if I get an answer.) Re-renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley seems like a no-brainer for the maps to comply with. A country names its own mountains. If Obama could rename it, Trump can re-rename it.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico, though, is an international body of water, and its name wasn&#39;t even debated until Trump started talking about it a few weeks ago. Google (and perhaps Apple) having a policy where they simply follow the naming conventions of the GNIS seems not merely sensible but utterly uncontroversial ... until now.</p><p> There are three countries in the world that don&#39;t use the metric system as their official units of measure: the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar.

<p>MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass:</p><blockquote><p> Anyway, this matters because it doesn&#39;t mean that DeepSeek, an app based off of the Chinese-developed AI model of the same name, is the most popular app ever despite its current place atop the charts. Your mom probably isn&#39;t downloading it. Just as last week, your mom probably wasn&#39;t <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-042-tiktok-twitter/#:~:text=%2D%2D%20Candacce%2C,in%20social%20media.">downloading Xiaohongshu</a> (&#39; <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-043-bromo-sapiens/#:~:text=%F0%9F%95%9A%20TikTok%20Prepares,%3F%20%5BInformation%20%F0%9F%94%92%5D">Little Red Book</a> &#39;), incidentally another Chinese app that rose to the top of the charts. But it is still interesting because again, the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure, new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right now, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from Google (Google) in the top 10.</p><p> Instead, we have the aforementioned DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Paramount+, Temu, Fox Sports, Bluesky, ReelShort, and VPN rounding out the top 10. It&#39;s pretty easy to see why each of these has risen: interest in AI, interest in sports around the NFL playoffs, interest in Twitter-like social networks given <a href="https://spyglass.org/a-time-to-kill-twitter/">the Xitter situation</a> , and yes, <a href="https://spyglass.org/twittertok/">the TikTok ban</a> .</p></blockquote><p> The specific reasons are varied, but altogether it really is true that, for the moment at least, there&#39;s a serious shakeup atop the App Store top free downloads list. That&#39;s interesting for several reasons.</p><p> DeepSeek is at #1 and ChatGPT #2. That&#39;s great for “AI” but a bad look for OpenAI at the moment. I can&#39;t help but think that DeepSeek having rocketed to the top spot, seemingly ( <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1226">but not actually</a> ) out of nowhere helped drive today&#39;s stock market reaction. (Google Gemini is down at #14.)</p><p> Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple&#39;s strength in AI. Sure, Apple&#39;s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">pretty embarrassing</a> right now, even <em>with</em> its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson&#39;s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/wwdc-apple-intelligence-apple-aggregates-ai/">reinforces Apple&#39;s role as an aggregator of AI</a> . The measuring stick for consumer AI products <em>and</em> public social media networks is where they&#39;re listed on the App Store. Not app stores, lowercase. <em>The</em> App Store. Apple&#39;s. That&#39;s The Show, the Major Leagues. So sure, it&#39;d be better for Apple users and Apple shareholders, and thus better for Apple itself, if Apple&#39;s own AI was at least sort of kind of competitive, rather than the butt of jokes. Aside from the easily forgotten iTunes Ping 15 years ago, Apple hasn&#39;t even <em>tried</em> to offer its own public broadcast-style social media platform. But the iPhone is <em>the</em> place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn&#39;t matter if Comcast&#39;s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut.</p><p> Lastly, when it comes to Meta: Threads is #3 (the people arguing that Threads is a bust sure are quiet lately), Instagram is down to #16 (not great if they were hoping for a bounce from TikTok&#39;s questionable future), WhatsApp #17 (not bad on iOS in the US, where iMessage is strongest) and Facebook is ... scroll, scroll, scroll ... #32, just behind Walmart and Microsoft Teams. 32 isn&#39;t that far ahead of X, which clocks in at #41. Facebook might never die, but we seem to be watching it fade away.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Shakeup in the App Store Top Downloads List’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> CNBC: &#39;Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China&#39;s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off&#39; </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-chinas-deepseek-triggers-global-tech-sell-off.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41519</id><published> 2025-01-27T22:15:20Z</published><updated> 2025-01-28T16:51:36Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jenni Reid and Alex Harring, reporting for CNBC:</p><blockquote><p> Nvidia and other US technology firms plunged on Monday, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America&#39;s leadership in the sector.</p><p> Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, last slid 17.3%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020.</p></blockquote><p> To make a long story short, it&#39;s been broadly assumed that leading-edge model training <em>and</em> inference requires the highest of high-end hardware — which hardware, especially for training, pretty much exclusively comes from Nvidia. The assumption was that any company trying to compete in this fiercely competitive field — a field with massive implications for industry, culture, and national security — must get in line to buy (or rent) enormous amounts of computational power exclusively available on the very best systems from Nvidia. That hardware isn&#39;t available (at least legally) to Chinese companies, because of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/u-s-targets-china-with-new-ai-curbs-overriding-nvidias-objections-d1e06807">the Biden administration&#39;s export bans</a> . DeepSeek engineers found and implemented multiple massive efficiency improvements that allowed the company to train its latest models at far lower prices using far-less-capable hardware, and perform <a href="https://www.vectara.com/glossary-of-llm-terms#llm-inference">inference</a> under heretofore unprecedented memory constraints. DeepSeek&#39;s achievements render obsolete several prior planks of conventional wisdom regarding the state of AI. My link a few sentences prior in this paragraph is to a WSJ report from 14 days ago that now feels like it dates from at least 14 <em>months</em> ago.</p><p> The most shocking result has been a 17 percent hit to Nvidia&#39;s stock price today, knocking somewhere around $350 <em>billion</em> off their market cap. Google is down about 4 percent, and Microsoft down 2 percent — but Meta is up 1 percent and Apple is up a little over 3 percent. I think the market is reacting pretty sensibly:</p><ul><li><p> Nvidia has taken an unprecedented beating. $350 billion is more than the combined market caps of Verizon <em>and</em> AT&amp;T (each worth roughly $170 billion). But Nvidia has been — and even with these breakthroughs from DeepSeek, remains — in an unprecedented position. Nvidia&#39;s high-flying valuation reflects its unprecedented position as <em>the</em> essential hardware company for AI. Nvidia&#39;s position, post-R1, remains essential — just not <em>as</em> essential as everyone thought. Hence the haircut. But Nvidia <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">remains</a> the third-most-valuable company in the world — it took a massive plunge today but in no way collapsed.</p></li><li><p> TSMC and Broadcom both took big hits today too (-13% and -17%, respectively). Being a “chip company” doesn&#39;t look as sweet today as it did last week.</p></li><li><p> If OpenAI were publicly traded, I suspect it might have collapsed — the sell-off it would have faced today might have triggered emergency measures that halted trading.</p></li><li><p> Microsoft has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/">distancing itself from OpenAI</a> , but is still intertwined with them like no other company. (Recall that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/28/wsj-openai-apple">Apple walked away from a big investment in OpenAI</a> just four months ago.) A -2% hit feels about right.</p></li><li><p> The broadest implication of DeepSeek&#39;s achievements is that really good AI is going to be even cheaper and more openly available than expected — sooner than expected. That&#39;s bad news for Google, whose entire enterprise value is based around their having an unassailable and sustainable lead in these areas. Google doesn&#39;t have to worry about <em>a</em> competitor coming along to rival them in search. They have to worry that the entire field of “search” is on the cusp of being commoditized. Thus the -4% hit.</p></li><li><p> Meta, the thinking goes, benefits as generative AI becomes cheaper. That&#39;s why Meta&#39;s own AI efforts are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40078025">sorta-kinda open source</a> . Meta has nothing to do with DeepSeek, but DeepSeek&#39;s achievements seem perfectly aligned with Meta&#39;s own interests in AI.</p></li><li><p> Apple benefits, indirectly, in at least two ways from DeepSeek&#39;s breakthroughs. First, a vast increase in the inference capabilities of RAM-constrained hardware strongly suggests that Apple&#39;s consumer devices will soon be able to perform far more AI computation locally. Apple Silicon&#39;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686">shared memory architecture</a> is perfect for this — and still un-replicated by anyone else in the industry. Second, Apple&#39;s decades-long <a href="https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/10/13/apple-vs-nvidia-what-happened.html">standoffish relationship with Nvidia</a> suddenly looks like less of a problem.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘CNBC: ‘Nvidia Drops 17 Percent as China’s Cheaper AI Model DeepSeek Sparks Global Tech Sell-Off’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/nvidia-deepseek-haircut">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Ben Thompson&#39;s DeepSeek FAQ </title><link href="https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41518</id><published> 2025-01-27T21:19:29Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T21:45:54Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Chinese AI lab DeepSeek <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/">made waves last week</a> when they dropped their new “open reasoning” LLM named R1. But over the weekend the full repercussions of their achievements (plural) began to sink in across the industry. My partner-in-Dithering Ben Thompson has written an extraordinarily helpful FAQ-style explanation at Stratechery today. If you, like me, were looking at the news today and thinking “Jeebus what the hell is going on with this DeepSeek thing?”, read Thompson&#39;s piece first. Two choice excerpts, first regarding OpenAI:</p><blockquote><p>但是，R1是值得注意的，因为O1独自一人是市场上唯一的推理模型，并且是Openai是市场领导者的最明显迹象。</p><p> R1以几种重要的方式撤消了O1神话。首先，它存在的事实。 Openai没有某种无法复制的特殊酱汁。其次，R1（与DeepSeek的所有模型一样）具有开放权重（说“开源”的问题是我们没有创建它的数据）。这意味着，您可以在选择的服务器上甚至在本地以较低的成本在选择的服务器上运行R1，而不是支付OpenAi来获得推理。</p></blockquote><p> Second, regarding DeepSeek&#39;s use of <a href="https://snorkel.ai/blog/llm-distillation-demystified-a-complete-guide/">distillation</a> (using existing LLMs to train new smaller ones):</p><blockquote><p> Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1.不过，这本身就是一个重要的收获：我们有一种情况，AI模型正在教授AI模型，而AI模型正在自学。我们正在观察AI起飞场景的组装。</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ben Thompson’s DeepSeek FAQ’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/deepseek-faq">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Removes &#39;2024&#39; Timeframe From Next-Generation CarPlay Page </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-removes-2024-from-next-gen-carplay-page/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41517</id><published> 2025-01-27T16:58:16Z</published><updated> 2025-01-27T16:58:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>10 years ago I ran a sponsorship from Meh, a then-new daily deals site from the founders of Woot (the OG daily deals site). In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/07/meh">my thank-you post to Meh a decade ago</a> , “I&#39;ve been selling weekly DF RSS feed sponsorships since 2007 — just a hair under 400 consecutive weeks. I&#39;ve never had one quite like this week&#39;s.” I&#39;m now up to 17 years of weekly DF sponsors, 887 weeks and counting, and while Meh has sponsored multiple times in the ensuing years, it remains true that there&#39;s never been another DF sponsor quite like (or maybe even <em>at all</em> like)嗯。</p><p> For their sponsored entry in last week&#39;s feed, Meh co-founder <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@_">Dave Rutledge</a> decided to re-run the exact same post they ran the first time 10 years ago.这里是：</p><blockquote><p> Fucking Amazon</p><p> I sold Woot to Amazon and they made it shitty.

<p>Jessica Lessin, writing for The Information back in 2014:</p><blockquote><p> Ms. Vorrath, who has worked on all seven iOS releases, generally operates by asking lots of questions of engineers, sticking to the facts and getting them to explain in plain English why a particular feature should be included in the operating system. She&#39;s easy to get along with, say former colleagues, who recall playfully mocking her 1990s feathered hairstyle and late 1980s fashion sense.

<p>Mark Gurman has an interesting scoop at Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.</p><p> Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple&#39;s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She&#39;ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn&#39;t been announced publicly. [...]</p><p> Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple&#39;s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow Vorrath&#39;s name has never before appeared on Daring Fireball, but she&#39;s renowned within Apple, legendary even, for her leadership role in managing the creation and development of the software for the original iPhone, effectively serving as Scott Forstall&#39;s chief of staff. Her reputation is that she&#39;s a great manager — she gets shit done, knows how to ship, and talented people enjoy and thrive working for her. But outside Apple she&#39;s largely flown under the radar — which only emphasizes how much of an Apple person&#39;s Apple person she is.</p><p> I checked with a source who&#39;s worked with Vorrath for years, and their comment says it all: “She kicks all the asses.”</p><blockquote><p> The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.</p></blockquote><p> My sense is that it&#39;s less about Siri and Apple Intelligence being more important than VisionOS, and more about Siri being a mess. More about urgency than importance. But perhaps it&#39;s <em>both</em> more urgent and more important long-term. Either way, assigning Vorrath — perhaps Apple&#39;s best fixer — makes sense. As <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">my piece yesterday illustrated</a> , something is rotten in the state of SiriLand.</p><p> Also very interesting: Gurman citing “a longtime Apple executive” as his source. Not “a source familiar with the matter”, but “a longtime Apple executive”. No “former” in there either. Apple generally doesn&#39;t want personnel changes made public, but this one, I think is an exception. Siri is terrible, far behind the competition, and everyone from Cupertino to Wall Street knows it.</p><p> Apple sending in Kim Vorrath is like Marsellus Wallace sending in Winston Wolfe.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Moves Kim Vorrath to Siri / Apple Intelligence Team’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/24/vorrath-siri-apple-intelligence">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w10" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/01/fucking_amazon_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41508</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-01-23T00:05:39Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:05:40Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>苹果：</p><blockquote><p> Click the amount you wish to contribute, then click Donate and Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires.</p></blockquote><p> Apple has prominent links to its Red Cross donation form on the web and in the App Store. They&#39;ve been doing this after catastrophes and disasters <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/27/nepal-red-cross-itunes">around the world</a> for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/13/red-cross">a long time</a> . On the surface, it&#39;s great because it&#39;s so easy. Apple already has your saved credentials so it takes just a few taps or clicks to donate. You can measure the time to donate in seconds, not minutes.</p><p> But an under-appreciated aspect of Apple acting as a front-end to the Red Cross is that your donation remains completely private. There&#39;s quite a lot of small print on the donation screen, which starts:</p><blockquote><p> Because Apple is not sharing your personal information with the American Red Cross, the American Red Cross is unable to further acknowledge your donation. You will receive an email receipt from Apple, which will serve as the only record of your donation. The donation will also appear on your credit card statement as a transaction with Apple. You do not purchase any goods or receive any services from Apple by making a donation. Any donation collected by Apple is collected in the name, and on behalf, of the American Red Cross. This donation may not qualify for any tax deduction or other tax benefits. By donating through Apple, you acknowledge that any tax consequences to you in making the donation (including, but not limited to, ensuring you have sufficient documentation to claim any applicable tax deduction) shall be your responsibility. Apple Account credit cannot be used to make a donation. Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern California wildfires (including Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Kern, Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial Counties).</p></blockquote><p> This sounds like a bunch of ignorable legalese but what it really means is quite interesting. You&#39;re not giving to the Red Cross through this. You&#39;re giving money to Apple, and Apple will then transfer 100 percent of it to the Red Cross. I&#39;m almost certain, for example, that Apple is covering the cost of the card transaction fees.</p><p> By donating this way, you will never get junk mail, email, or text messages from the Red Cross, or from any “partner” of the Red Cross, soliciting additional donations, because the Red Cross will never get your name, address, or数字。 All they get is your money.</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/28/messages-political-spam">Back in August I wrote about</a> how my political solicitations via SMS had gotten so out of control, so downright annoying, that my wife and I had scaled back our donations to political campaigns, because it was obvious that previous campaigns we had donated to had shared or sold our information. We&#39;d been put on a Suckers List.</p><p> The same thing, sadly, happens with charities. People generally don&#39;t want to admit to selfishness, but I will. When I give money to a charitable cause, I always look for the checkboxes to opt out of being contacted by them in the future. When it happens anyway, I get annoyed, and I become reluctant to give to that charity again. And because it has happened repeatedly, it&#39;s made me at least somewhat more reluctant to give to <em>any</em> charitable cause in the first place. I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling that way.</p><p> When you donate to the Red Cross via Apple, that concern is off the table. Apple won&#39;t emphasize that aspect of this, because they don&#39;t want to throw the Red Cross under the proverbial bus, but I will. An underrated aspect of privacy is the desire simply not to be annoyed.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Southern California Wildfire Relief: Consider Donating to the Red Cross Through Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/apple-red-cross-socal-fire-relief">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>从顶部泄漏的船回来了</title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.rE4.mJTz.1TTdhPOAPRw-&amp;smid=url-share" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41506</id><published> 2025-01-22T21:41:08Z</published><updated> 2025-01-23T00:53:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From a multi-byline profile of Stephen Miller in The New York Times last week:</p><blockquote><p> Mr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J. Trump&#39;s terms. He made clear that Mr. Trump would crack down on immigration and go to war against the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, culture that had been embraced by Meta and much of corporate America in recent years.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg was amenable. He signaled to Mr. Miller and his colleagues, including other senior Trump advisers, that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda, according to three people with knowledge of the meeting, who asked for anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would instead focus solely on building tech products.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees&#39; self-expression in the workplace, according to one of the people with knowledge of the meeting. He said new guidelines and a series of layoffs amounted to a reset and that more changes were coming.</p></blockquote><p> This account of the meeting clearly leaked from Trump&#39;s side, not Meta&#39;s side. The tone of it is that Miller told Zuckerberg to jump, and that Zuck obsequiously and gladly responded “How high?”</p><p> Zuckerberg scrambled for cover, posting a “Sheryl did amazing work at Meta and will forever be a legend in the industry [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DE8CZDKSPkw">tweet to Threads</a> , followed by a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lfxlauieic2f">coordinated</a> “Thank you, @zuck. I will always be grateful for the many years we spent building a great business together [...]” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/DE8GHndSWq4">reply from Sandberg</a> . (Sandberg, who left Meta in 2022, only posted <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sherylsandberg/post/C6OdV4Zr6pf">once</a> to Threads in all of 2024. There&#39;s a good chance this will be her only post in 2025.)</p><p> Zuckerberg, politically, seems in way over his head. The first Trump administration was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-trump-aide-says-witnessed-kellyanne-conway-leaking-information-media-220749233.html">infamous for its leaks</a> . They barely hid it. The whole Trump brand is about brazenness. For decades, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/13/trump-john-miller">Trump was known to call reporters in New York under the guise of “John Miller” or “John Barron”</a> , who were ostensibly public relations spokesmen representing Trump. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_used_by_Donald_Trump">it was just him</a> — and he didn&#39;t even disguise his voice. He just did it.</p><p> So of course Stephen Miller (or Miller&#39;s equivalent of John Barron) leaked the confidential nature of his discussion with Zuckerberg to The New York Times, because it made Miller look dominating and Zuckerberg look dominated. Even though it&#39;s painfully obvious to anyone who sees this story that anything confidential they tell Stephen Miller might get leaked if it makes Miller look good. It&#39;s like a perversion of your Miranda rights, a Miranda <em>wrongs</em> if you will: Anything you say to anyone in the Trump administration can and will be used against you in leaks to the media.</p><p> You don&#39;t see stories like this about Cook or Nadella or Bezos, because I think those guys have the good sense to keep their mouths shut and just nod their heads. (Not Musk, though. When Trump and Musk eventually divorce in a spectacular flame-out, we&#39;ll be deluged with stories about what Musk said in supposed confidence.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Ship That Leaks From the Top Is Back’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/the-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top-is-back">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Legal Nerdery on Trump&#39;s TikTok Executive Order </title><link href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump's-tiktok-executive-order-and-the-limits-of-executive-non-enforcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/legal-nerdery-on-trumps-tiktok-executive-order" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41505</id><published> 2025-01-22T20：37：49Z</published><updated> 2025-01-22T20：37：49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Alan Rozenshtein, writing for Lawfare:</p><blockquote><p> While Apple and Google maintained their compliance, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online">Oracle and Akamai made the remarkable decision to resume services</a> , despite facing potentially catastrophic liability rates. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump followed through by <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-orders-75-day-pause-on-tiktok-law-enforcement">issuing an executive order</a> that suspended PAFACAA enforcement for 75 days and attempted to provide retroactive protection for any violations before and during the nonenforcement period.</p><p> TikTok&#39;s tech partners face a key executive power question: Can they rely on Trump&#39;s promises not to enforce PAFACAA? If companies continue providing services to TikTok, can Trump later change his mind and pursue enforcement actions against them for all accumulated violations? Could a future administration enforce these violations regardless of Trump&#39;s current promises? The stakes are enormous — nearly a trillion dollars in potential liability.

<p>From Apple&#39;s developer release notes for iOS 18.3, now at release candidate (RC) status:</p><blockquote><p> For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding.设置设备后，用户将可以访问Apple Intelligence功能。为了禁用Apple Intelligence，用户将需要导航到Apple Intelligence＆Siri设置窗格并关闭Apple Intelligence切换。这将禁用其设备上的Apple Intelligence功能。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes">Same for MacOS 15.3</a> Sequoia, which is also at RC status and expected next week.</p><p> I have mixed feelings about this decision. It&#39;s pretty obvious that Apple Intelligence has a slew of shortcomings. It&#39;s the nature of the beast, though, that it&#39;s always going to have some shortcomings. <em>Human</em> intelligence, which to date remains the gold standard for intelligence in general, has some pretty glaring shortcomings, so it&#39;s unsurprising that all artificial intelligence systems still do too. (Perhaps that&#39;s a good metric for defining the next inflection point, now that the Turing Test has been passed: When humans need to ask AI systems to explain their own shortcomings, because we&#39;re no longer smart enough to detect them ourselves.)</p><p> So the bar shouldn&#39;t be “has obvious shortcomings”. It&#39;s whether Apple Intelligence is good enough. Compared to other systems, like ChatGPT, no, it&#39;s not good enough. But Apple has been enabling Siri by default since 2011. And Siri, today, is arguably worse than it&#39;s ever been when compared to the state of the art. A friend just sent me <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/siri-or-your-own-lii-ing-eyes.jpeg">this screenshot</a> after asking Siri “Who won Super Bowl 13?” and getting this answer: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. In addition to wrongly casing the Roman numerals, LII is 52, not 13. The only way Siri could have been more wrong would be if the Eagles hadn&#39;t even won Super Bowl 52. I just tried the same question — “Who won Super Bowl 13?” — on both my iPhone running iOS 18.3 RC1 and my Mac running MacOS 15.1.1, and Siri gave me the same wrong answer, on both devices, both when the question was spoken aloud and when it was typed: “Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl Lii • Winner”. Siri, today, is an unfunny joke.</p><p> But so I think it&#39;s reasonable to ask whether Apple Intelligence is as good as Siri. I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s about how good Apple Intelligence is. In fact, I&#39;d say several of the Apple Intelligence features — Clean Up in Photos, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">notification summaries</a> — are <em>better</em> than Siri. So if Siri has been on by default for over a decade, sure, Apple should go ahead and turn Apple Intelligence on by default too.</p><p> I think there could be significant benefit to turning it on by default, sort of in the spirit of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">dogfooding</a> . Enabling Apple Intelligence features by default will increase the pressure on Apple to keep improving it at a fast clip. It&#39;s also the case that none of Apple Intelligence&#39;s features, with the possible exception of notification summaries, are in the user&#39;s face at all. You have to invoke them to use them. If you don&#39;t want them — or don&#39;t even know about them — you won&#39;t notice anything different once they&#39;re enabled by default. Apple may or may not be <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171226-00/?p=97655">over-indexing</a> on Apple Intelligence, but, thankfully, they&#39;re <em>not</em> shoving it in users&#39; faces.</p><p> But, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">as I wrote two weeks ago</a> , enabling it by default for all users really puts the lie to their claim that all of Apple Intelligence is “beta”. If it&#39;s not just merely shipping to all users, but now enabled by default, that&#39;s not beta. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/beta-is-not-an-excuse-archive">That&#39;s just buggy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Next Week’s iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Updates Will Enable Apple Intelligence During Onboarding’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/22/ios-18-3-macos-153-apple-intelligence-default-onboarding">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Support: &#39;About Availability of TikTok and ByteDance Ltd.

<p>Apple Support document, which is linked from the App Store if you search for any of the apps from ByteDance:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025. [...]</p><p> If you already have these apps installed on your device, they will remain on your device. But they can&#39;t be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device. In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.</p><p> Users in the United States won&#39;t receive updates for these apps, which could potentially impact performance, security, and compatibility with future versions of iOS and iPadOS, and some app functions might become limited or stop working since the app can&#39;t receive updates 。</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">My take from Sunday</a> on Trump&#39;s reprieve-by-executive-fiat seems correct: it has no bearing on the law. Really, all his executive order does is instruct the Justice Department (or as he would call it, <em>his</em> Justice Department) not to enforce the law for 75 days, and to promise any company that violates the PAFACA law that they won&#39;t be prosecuted为此。 There&#39;s really no question about it: Oracle and Akamai are violating the law by providing services to TikTok users in the United States. They&#39;re simply taking Trump at his word that the law will not be enforced and they will not face penalties for violating it during Trump&#39;s completely arbitrary 75-day grace period.</p><p> That&#39;s not like a pardon. Trump&#39;s executive order yesterday carries no more legal weight than a Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” card. I don&#39;t think it will happen but there&#39;s nothing that would stop the Trump Justice Department from changing its mind and prosecuting Oracle and Akamai for these violations.

<p>Wesley Hilliard, writing for AppleInsider regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">Edits</a> , Meta&#39;s pre-announced mobile-first video editing app:</p><blockquote><p> Despite that, many apps and features on iPhone toe the line between fun tool and social platform. One of those tools was Clips, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/06/apple-launches-new-social-focused-clips-video-editing-app-for-iphone-ipad">arrived in 2017</a> to little fanfare and has been forgotten since.</p><p> Meta and ByteDance have a reason to push their respective video editing apps — brand synergy. More users mean more data, more content, and more ad revenue. Apple, however, doesn&#39;t have the same motivation.</p><p> While Apple would likely love to see users flock to Clips, it would mean entering a race to satisfy a wave of several million customers in an app and interface that was never really more than a proof of concept. It would be a money pit with very little reward as Apple doesn&#39;t have a social platform to drive users to or a way to monetize the app.</p></blockquote><p> I completely agree with Hilliard that the announcement of Edits is the perfect time to mention Clips. I completely disagree with him that Apple has no motivation to dedicate itself to the task of making Clips incredible.</p><p> A mobile-first video editor isn&#39;t a “money pit”.这是一个应用。 Apple makes a lot of apps, and they could easily afford to assign a team to make Clips truly great. It&#39;s no different than 20–25 years ago, when Apple dedicated itself to making iMovie and Final Cut both great apps. It&#39;s no different than the motivation to create GarageBand. The monetization wouldn&#39;t be direct; it would be downstream of the general idea that if you&#39;re editing videos for social media on your phone, the best app to do it with is from Apple and it&#39;s exclusively available on iPhone. The idea is that Apple doesn&#39;t just make the best computing devices for artists, writers, and creators, but they also make some of the best apps for those fields too.</p><p> There are actually a lot of interesting UI ideas in Clips. But if Apple isn&#39;t interested in making Clips truly great for people who actually love editing videos using their phones, they should just abandon it. Make it great or give up. Keeping it around as an also-ran that no one uses is a bad look. This is the sort of thing Apple should pride itself on: best-of-breed creative tools.</p><p> I don&#39;t know if Edits is a rip-off of CapCut or not, but it&#39;s definitely not a rip-off of Clips. It&#39;s a good rule of thumb that when Apple succeeds at something, it gets ripped off. The better the Apple product, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/22/byford-china-android-forks">the more shamelessly it gets copied</a> . Apple should make Clips into an iOS video editing app that everyone rips off shamelessly.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Remember Clips?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Meta Teases &#39;Edits&#39;, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347358/instagram-edits-capcut-video-app-tiktok-ban" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41499</id><published> 2025-01-21T00:34:09Z</published><updated> 2025-01-21T00:34:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wes Davis, writing at The Verge, under the headline “Instagram Announces a Blatant CapCut Clone”:</p><blockquote><p> Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBIzLAynIQ/">just announced</a> a video editing app called Edits. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFBNqdGSee4?xmt=AQGzCOMan-oc70fxP0uSA3x3sZd58_GJeUpjK1AD4X30tA">Mosseri said</a> the app is meant to rival CapCut, a video editing app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">went offline along with TikTok</a> . Edits is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378">preorder on the iOS App Store</a> .</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t use CapCut (and can&#39;t download it now), so I can&#39;t judge whether the screenshots of Edits indicate that it&#39;s a copycat of CapCut (say that five times fast), which would be pretty funny coming so closely on the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/">Zuckerberg&#39;s claim on Joe Rogan&#39;s show</a> that Apple hasn&#39;t invented anything new since the iPhone, or if it&#39;s just a different take on a video editing app for phones. Adobe InDesign was absolutely designed to make QuarkXPress users feel at home, but it wasn&#39;t a rip-off or clone. It was (and remains) an Adobe take on Quark-style page layout. I&#39;m curious what those familiar with CapCut think.</p><p> Glad to see The Verge warming up to calling blatant clones “blatant clones”, though, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-ripoff">rather than</a> “not exactly hiding where it got its inspiration from” and “that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing!”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Meta Teases ‘Edits’, an Upcoming Video Editing App to Rival CapCut’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Dedicates Homepage to the Leader the US Is Celebrating Today </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w0o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41496</id><published> 2025-01-20T16:45:00Z</published><updated> 2025-01-20T19:18:20Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Interesting selection of Martin Luther King Jr. quotes they&#39;ve chosen for the homepage ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/apple.com-mlk-2025.pdf">PDF archive for posterity</a> ):</p><blockquote><ul><li> “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.”</li><li> “You must decide to speak for yourself; nobody else can speak for you.”</li><li> “We cannot preserve self without being concerned about preserving other selves.”</li></ul></blockquote><p> Read into those quotes what you will, given today&#39;s other national significance. I think there&#39;s an implied message here, but it&#39;s subtle. I&#39;ll pick a different quote from King, one that I believe better speaks to the current moment:</p><p> “The great majority of Americans are suspended between these opposing attitudes. They are uneasy with injustice but unwilling yet to pay a significant price to eradicate it.”</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Dedicates Homepage to the Leader the U.S. Is Celebrating Today’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
