<p>Ploum 在一篇题为“如何杀死去中心化网络（例如 Fediverse）”的文章中：</p><blockquote><p> 2013 年，Google 意识到大多数 XMPP 交互都是在 Google Talk 用户之间进行的。他们并不关心遵守他们无法100%控制的协议。因此他们终止了合作并宣布不再结盟。并开始了漫长的探索，以创建一个即时通讯工具，从 Hangout 开始（随后是 Allo、Duo。之后我就记不清了）。 [...]</p><p>虽然 XMPP 仍然存在并且是一个非常活跃的社区，但它从未从这次打击中恢复过来。对谷歌采用的过高期望导致了巨大的失望，并悄然被遗忘。 XMPP 成为利基市场。如此小众，以至于当群聊风靡一时（Slack、Discord）时，自由软件社区重新发明了它（Matrix）以进行竞争，而群聊已经可以通过 XMPP 实现。 （免责声明：我从未研究过 Matrix 协议，所以我不知道它在技术上与 XMPP 相比如何。我只是相信它解决了相同的问题并与 XMPP 在相同的空间中竞争）。</p><p>如果 Google 从未加入 XMPP 或从未被视为其中的一部分，今天的 XMPP 会有所不同吗？没有人能说。但我相信它会生长得更慢，也许更健康。它将比今天更大、更重要。它将成为默认的去中心化通信平台。有一点是肯定的：如果 Google 没有加入，XMPP 不会比今天更糟糕。</p></blockquote><p>这是在<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/more_on_preemptively_blocking">Mastodon 和 Facebook 即将推出的“Threads”项目的背景下</a>，以及 Mastodon 实例管理员的子集承诺先发制人地阻止它。基本上，这是一个论点，即谷歌应用了微软旧的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">拥抱、扩展、熄灭策略</a>来杀死 XMPP，因此在争论大规模联合协议是否应该允许大型企业实例加入时，XMPP 是一个比电子邮件更好的例子。</p><p>我不买。 XMPP 是一种即时消息传递协议。即时通讯实际上已经死了。 AIM 已经消失了，我在写这篇文章时才了解到 ICQ 显然仍然存在。所有现代消息传递协议都具有某种形式的消息持久性；即时通讯没有。使用即时消息传递，您只能在某人登录并且客户端应用程序打开并运行时向他们发送消息。你无法证明是否定的，但我认为无论 Google 十年前的决定如何，XMPP 在今天都没有任何相关性。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“抱歉，XMPP 注定要失败，而不是被 Google 消灭”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/26/xmpp-google">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/ftc_amazon_prime" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw8" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40040</id><published> 2023-06-27T00:22:54Z</published><updated> 2023-06-27T01:02:14Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我完全赞成联邦贸易委员会追求和执行法律，要求“所有”订阅服务都具有清晰、可发现的在线取消选项。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Neil Long 在 Mobilegamer.biz 上撰文，对 Phillip Shoemaker 进行了一次有趣的采访，后者曾于 2009 年至 2016 年在 Apple 负责 App Store 审核：</p><blockquote><p>苹果的应用程序审查流程对于移动游戏制造商来说仍然是一个大问题，因为他们需要遵循模糊的指导方针和不一致的裁决。因此，我们询问了 Shoemaker 对于苹果如何解决这个问题的想法：</p><p> “解决这种不一致的方法——我不想这么说——是：让我们借鉴谷歌的经验，”他告诉我们。 “尤其是现在有了人工智能工具。你大概可以完成审核团队 80% 的工作。”</p></blockquote><p>在应用商店时代，很明显，苹果的<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/03/teabot-data-steal-google-play/">恶意软件泄露问题</a>比<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-password-stealing-malware-infects-100-000-google-play-users/">谷歌的</a>要少。据我所知，没有哪个 iOS 开发者不认为 App Store（尤其是审核）可以而且应该在很多方面进行改进。但“<em>让它更像 Play 商店</em>”和“<em>使用人工智能进行审核</em>”对我来说听起来都不对。</p><p>此外，自 Shoemaker 于 2016 年离开 Apple 以来，App Store 审核时间已从平均约 5 天减少到 1 天。（我的理解是，新的自动化工具是流程改进的重要组成部分。Shoemaker 对 App Store 审核的抱怨似乎停留在2016年。）</p><blockquote><p>与苹果高级副总裁 Eddy Cue、Greg &#39;Joz&#39; Joswiak 和 App Store 副总裁 Matt Fischer 相比，席勒似乎是最后一个坚持自动化应用审核的人。 “我认为从根本上改进 App Store 的方法是让 Phil 成为 Apple 员工，让他不再涉足 App Store，”Shoemaker 说。 “这才是他们真正需要做的。艾迪更进步，乔兹更进步，我们知道马特也是如此。菲尔只需要把他的肉爪子从 App Store 上撤下来就可以了。”</p><p> “如果菲尔不退后一步，法院绝对会做出改变，”舒梅克继续说道。</p></blockquote><p>如果我在苹果公司工作，我会打印一个“Meaty Paws”标志并将其贴在席勒的门上。</p><blockquote><p> “菲尔需要退后一步，我认为这是主要的事情——需要新鲜血液加入并做出一些改变，因为降低价格和开放指导方针以允许新的有趣的事物将是至关重要的。”</p></blockquote><p>当然，菲尔·席勒 (Phil Schiller) 就是<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">在 2011 年的一份备忘录中建议降低苹果公司佣金的</a>高管。</p><blockquote><p> “为菲尔工作很艰难……他是那些喜欢侮辱别人的人之一，对吧？我的意思是他没有界限——他会侮辱你的孩子，你会想：‘我为什么又在这家公司工作？’”</p><p>舒梅克会定期从他的孩子那里获取有关应用程序和游戏的反馈，并在 ERB 会议中使用这些反馈。 “菲尔会说，哦，这样说真是愚蠢，你的孩子有那么笨吗？你就像，你在开玩笑吗？</p></blockquote><p>看来两个菲尔斯相处得并不好。 Shoemaker 也没有透露<a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/apple-fart-apps/">iWiz 是否会重返 App Store</a> 。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“前应用商店审核主管 Phillip Shoemaker 似乎对 Phil Schiller 有一种奇怪的个人恩怨”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/shoemaker-schiller">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>为什么乳齿象的采用停滞不前？ </title><link href="https://blog.bloonface.com/2023/06/12/why-did-the-twittermigration-fail/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw1" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40033</id><published> 2023-06-23T19:05:11Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T19:05:12Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Kev Quirk, co-founder of Fosstodon (a <a href="https://fedidb.org/network/instance/fosstodon.org">60,000-user</a> Mastodon instance):</p><blockquote><p> Truth is, there isn&#39;t that much info out there on how this thing will actually work, or what it will be capable of. Lots of people seem to be concerned about Facebook “getting their info”. Fact is, they can do that now if they really want to — it would be trivial for Facebook to stand something up that hoovers up all the public data that&#39;s on the Fediverse, via API.</p><p> And that&#39;s the clincher here — <em>it&#39;s all public data</em> . So the best advice I can give if you&#39;re concerned about your data, is lock down your account and don&#39;t post publicly.</p><p> All that being said, here&#39;s what we plan to do <em>if</em> this thing ever sees the light of day:</p><ul><li> As a team, we will review what the service is capable of and what advantages/disadvantages such a service will bring to the Fediverse</li><li> We will then make a determination on whether we will defederate that service</li><li> We will <em>NOT</em> jump on the bandwagon, or partake in the rumour mill that seems to be plaguing the Fediverse at the moment</li></ul><p> It&#39;s important to say that neither myself or Mike like anything that Facebook stands for.

<p>Mike Masnick, back in 2019:</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;ve argued for years that while many people like to say that content moderation is <em>difficult</em> , that&#39;s misleading. Content moderation at scale <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=content+moderation+at+scale">is impossible to do well</a> . Importantly, this is <em>not</em> an argument that we should throw up our hands and do nothing. Nor is it an argument that companies can&#39;t do <em>better jobs</em> within their own content moderation efforts. But I do think there&#39;s a huge problem in that many people — including many politicians and journalists — seem to expect that these companies not only can, but should, strive for a level of content moderation that is simply impossible to reach.</p><p> And thus, throwing humility to the wind, I&#39;d like to propose Masnick&#39;s Impossibility Theorem, as a sort of play on Arrow&#39;s Impossibility Theorem. <em>Content moderation at scale is impossible to do well</em> . More specifically, it will always end up frustrating very large segments of the population and will always fail to accurately represent the “proper” level of moderation of anyone.

<p>My brief “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">Not That Kind of &#39;Open&#39;</a> ” piece yesterday <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230620/p9#a230620p9">struck a chord</a> for some.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@chrismessina/110573508557787120">Chris Messina</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Not federating is certainly a choice admins can make, but it&#39;s unlikely to have an impact considering that Threads is being bootstrapped off the Instagram social graph.</p><p> Would you rather keep the fediverse restricted to its current population of ~8M people or scale it to ~2.35B+?</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t think most Instagram users will even try Threads (or whatever it&#39;s going to be called). But a lot might. And “just sign in using your existing Instagram identity” is a powerful enticement. If you already have an Instagram account, you&#39;ll be able to jump right in. How to get started with Mastodon (or any of the other ActivityPub “Fediverse” platforms) has been an enormous obstacle to adoption. People find it confusing, and people don&#39;t like being confused. “Just use your Instagram identity” is not confusing at all.</p><p> I think there are a lot of long-time Mastodon users who <em>like</em> the fact that it isn&#39;t gaining mainstream traction, and want to keep it that way. But then don&#39;t call it “open”.</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110573756551776352">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s a weird own goal for various Mastodon admins who are running a decentralized social network based on interoperable protocols to pledge that they won&#39;t interoperate with services from existing social networks if built on the same open protocols.</p><p> It&#39;s not even the hypocrisy, it&#39;s just dumb and undermines the entire point of interoperable protocols.</p></blockquote><p> The hypocrisy irks me, but I think he&#39;s right that it&#39;s foolish too. The Mastodon server admins who are preemptively promising to defederate Threads are effectively guaranteeing that users on their instances will be isolated from a potential majority of users on the overall platform.</p><p> <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/19.html">Dave Winer, at Scripting News</a> :</p><blockquote><p> They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is — who&#39;s being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn&#39;t mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn&#39;t one of them. You have to <em>think</em> .</p><p> But here&#39;s some good news. There&#39;s no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it&#39;s probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is “really simple” and the benefit of federation is well known <em>to users</em> . That&#39;s been what&#39;s kept it from being pwned by bigco&#39;s all these years.</p></blockquote><p> I cited email as an example yesterday of big companies running big instances and not extinguishing the openness that made the platform great. Podcasting is maybe an even better example. I don&#39;t take podcasting&#39;s future for granted, but 20 years in, it&#39;s still thriving as an open medium, despite the presence of titanic players like Apple, Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify. Ultimately the involvement of these big companies has made <em>open</em> podcasting far more popular and enduring than I ever would have imagined 20 years ago, because they brought podcasting to the mass market. And there are some roles that we need big centralized players to play even on an open platform. Apple&#39;s iTunes podcast directory, for example. Facebook&#39;s Threads app could be something akin to Apple Podcasts for Mastodon.</p><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TNLNYC/110576140169004056">Tristan Louis</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The anti-Meta #Fedipact can only achieve one thing: make sure that #ActivityPub loses to the Bluesky protocol. Is that what people here want?</p><p> As an #openweb advocate, I don&#39;t.</p><p> Meta joining the Fediverse is like AOL joining the internet: something that will bring a mass amount of people in, create some friction, but ultimately make the net better as more people federating on #Mastodon, #kbin, #lemmy, #pixelfed and other parts of the Fediverse make open protocols that much stronger.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://kbin.social/">Kbin</a> and <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> are to Reddit what Mastodon is to Twitter. Unsurprisingly, they&#39;re <a href="https://kbin.fediverse.observer/stats">both</a> <a href="https://lemmy.fediverse.observer/stats">seeing</a> an infusion of new users this month, but are both still tiny compared to Reddit.</p><p> One controversial aspect to this story is that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384207">Meta apparently invited the admins from several top Mastodon instances to brief them on their plans</a> , under NDA. <a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/110573363201929310">Tim Bray</a> :</p><blockquote><p> My take:</p><ol><li> The Fedi folks shouldn&#39;t have taken the NDA&#39;d meeting. Transparency is essential.</li><li> It is not reasonable to expect ethical behaviour from Meta. It should be assumed that that if they can profit by disemboweling the Fediverse, they will.</li><li> There is an opportunity to attract some of the ordinary decent humans on Meta because they don&#39;t know anything better exists.</li></ol><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t de-federate. But only by about 51/49.</p></blockquote><p> Of course such a meeting would be under NDA, for now. It&#39;s an unreleased and as-yet unannounced product. Meeting with Facebook under NDA isn&#39;t ipso facto wrong — although I do think the fact that they were invited shouldn&#39;t itself be part of the NDA. Transparency is essential, but transparency can come after Threads is actually announced. The idea that NDAs are inherently nefarious is just conspirational tinfoil-hat nonsense. (Tinfoil hat nonsense is, alas, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470">having a moment</a> .)</p><p> On point 2, I&#39;m fine with starting Facebook with two strikes against it. Put them on a short leash. They start fucking around, Mastodon instances should start de-federating from their product. I just don&#39;t see why they should be blocked preemptively. The whole point of an open protocol like ActivityPub is that no one can own it. I&#39;ll close this post with the same question I did <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">yesterday</a> : Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer. Others clearly disagree.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ More on Preemptively Blocking Facebook&#39;s Imminent ActivityPub Entry</title></entry><entry><title> Regulation for Thee, but Not for Me </title><link href="https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvm" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40018</id><published> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</published><updated> 2023-06-21T00:36:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Billy Perrigo, reporting for Time:</p><blockquote><p> The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, has spent the last month touring world capitals where, at talks to sold-out crowds and in meetings with heads of governments, he has repeatedly spoken of the need for global AI regulation.</p><p> But behind the scenes, OpenAI has lobbied for significant elements of the most comprehensive AI legislation in the world — the EU&#39;s AI Act — to be watered down in ways that would reduce the regulatory burden on the company, according to documents about OpenAI&#39;s engagement with EU officials obtained by Time from the European Commission via freedom of information requests.</p></blockquote><p> I think concerns about the current state of AI are overwrought, and that regulation is not called for. But what Altman seems to be pushing for isn&#39;t a hands-off approach from regulators — instead he just wants it enshrined in law that OpenAI and only OpenAI is exempt from regulations.</p><p> A very interesting and cogent paper leaked out of Google a few weeks ago, with the title “ <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">We Have No Moat, and Neither Does OpenAI</a> ”. The basic argument in the paper is that open-source AI will outcompete Google and OpenAI&#39;s proprietary approaches. Ever since I read this leaked paper, it&#39;s seemed clear to me that Sam Altman believes this as well, and so he&#39;s been devoted to creating a <em>regulatory</em> moat to protect OpenAI.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Regulation for Thee, but Not for Me’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><link href="https://l.kolide.co/3JWbXEv" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uw2" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/06/kolide_zero_trust_for_okta_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/feeds/sponsors//11.40034</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2023-06-20T23:55:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-23T23:56:06Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#39;s an uncomfortable fact: at most companies, employees can download sensitive company data onto any device, keep it there forever, and never even know that they&#39;re doing something wrong.</p><p> Kolide&#39;s new report, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3I7025A">The State of Sensitive Data</a> , shines a light on an area of security that is often ignored, but is nevertheless a massive hole in many companies&#39; Zero Trust fortress. </p><p><img

  alt="Study results showing that companies have poor policies for requiring user authentication to access sensitive data (65%); prohibiting downloading sensitive data onto personal devices (46%); ensuring plain-text access credentions are not stored on employee devices (38%); setting a specified time period sensitive data can reside on an employee device (16%)."
/></p><p> These findings are particularly alarming given the overall state of device security. IT teams routinely struggle to enforce timely OS updates and patch management, meaning that end users are storing your most sensitive data–things like customer records, confidential IP, and plain-text access credentials–on devices that are vulnerable to attack.</p><p> This problem has gone unaddressed because until now there hasn&#39;t been a good solution for it. <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3lch4WK">MDM solutions are too blunt an instrument</a> for dealing with sensitive data, and <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3DTTpRA">DLP tools are too extreme and invasive</a> for most companies. After all, you&#39;re not trying to ban downloads together, nor regard every download as suspicious. You&#39;re just trying to make sure employees aren&#39;t keeping data for longer than they need or keeping it on an unmanaged or un-secure device.</p><p> Kolide offers a more nuanced approach to setting and enforcing sensitive data policies.</p><p> <em>Our premise is simple: if an employee&#39;s device is out of compliance, it can&#39;t access your apps.</em></p><p> Kolide lets admins run queries to detect sensitive data, flag devices that have violated policies, and enforce OS and browser updates so vulnerable devices aren&#39;t accessing data.</p><p> Our unique approach makes device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn&#39;t compliant, users can&#39;t log in to their cloud apps until they&#39;ve fixed the problem.

<p>Tim Hardwick, on a tweaked feature in iOS 17 beta 1:</p><blockquote><p> Apple in iOS 13 decided to redesign QR code scanning so that the link appeared as a yellow button within the camera viewfinder itself. However, in doing so, it created a new problem: The button would rove around in the viewfinder if the camera lens was also in motion, which made tapping it even more tricky than before.</p><p> Thankfully, in iOS 17, Apple has made another small, and this time welcome, change that improves the situation immeasurably. Now when you scan a QR code, the link button automatically appears at the bottom of the Camera interface. So instead of chasing the dancing link around the viewfinder, you can simply tap its fixed location above the shutter button.</p></blockquote><p> My tip for scanning QR codes is not to use the Camera app at all. Instead, enable iOS&#39;s hidden built-in Code Scanner app in Contol Center. Go to Settings → Control Center, and under More Controls, enable Code Scanner. (This is also a good reminder that you can disable Control Center items you seldom use.) Now when you encounter a QR code, just pull down Control Center and use the Code Scanner app.</p><p> Worth keeping in mind, too, that when you use the regular Camera app to scan a QR code, if you open the link, it opens in Safari. With the Code Scanner app in Control Center, links open in a sandboxed in-app web view, which is more private. The only downside is that if you want to keep the opened page around, you&#39;ll need to open it in Safari from within Code Scanner.</p><p> Code Scanner is a fantastic little “do one thing and do it well” app, but because you can only get to it via Control Center but it&#39;s not shown in Control Center by default, most people don&#39;t even know it exists. It&#39;s truly a hidden gem.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Turns out you can also launch the Code Scanner app <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/code-scanner-via-search.jpeg">by searching for it on the iOS home screen</a> . Also, you can tell Siri “scan a QR code” or “open QR Code Scanner” and it&#39;ll open.好的！</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘On Scanning QR Codes With Your iPhone’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/qr-codes-iphone">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Not That Kind of &#39;Open&#39; </title><link href="https://fedipact.online/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvk" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40016</id><published> 2023-06-19T22:27:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-19T23:08:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The Anti-Meta Fedi Pact:</p><blockquote><p> “i am an instance admin/mod on the fediverse. by signing this pact, i hereby agree to block any instances owned by meta should they pop up on the fediverse. project92 is a real and serious threat to the health and longevity of fedi and must be fought back against at every possible opportunity”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jw4o5d45v22a">Yours truly, on Bluesky a month ago</a> (which, ironically, is not yet open itself, so <a href="https://skeeet.xyz/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jw4o5d45v22a">here&#39;s an open preview</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Masto zealots: We&#39;re open, federate with us!</p><p> Instagram: Great, we&#39;re building a new thing to join you.</p><p> Masto zealots: Not that kind of open!</p></blockquote><p> It should go without saying that I&#39;m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/facebook+criminal+enterprise">no fan of Meta/Facebook</a> . But the idea that administrators of Mastodon/Fediverse instances should pledge to preemptively block Facebook&#39;s imminent Twitter-like ActivityPub service ( <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">purportedly named Threads</a> ) strikes me as petty and deliberately insular. I don&#39;t like Facebook, the company, and I&#39;ve never seen the appeal of Facebook, the product (aka “the blue app”). But there are literally <em>billions</em> of good people who use their services. Why cut them off from the open ActivityPub social world? Large swaths of Mastodon seem to relish the fact that it&#39;s confusing how to get started, and that this confusion is keeping Mastodon small.</p><p> The whole point of ActivityPub as an open protocol is to turn Twitter/Instagram-like social networking into something more akin to email: truly open. If Facebook were on the cusp of launching a Gmail-like email service, would you preemptively declare that your email server would block them? To me that&#39;s what this “Anti-Meta Fedi Pact” <a href="https://g33ks.coffee/@tiesselune/110569596742983089">is arguing for</a> .</p><p> Maybe I&#39;m wrong! I certainly don&#39;t think the “ <em>let&#39;s pledge to block Facebook before their Fediverse thing even starts</em> ” people are nuts. But to me this feels like convicting Facebook of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">pre-crime</a> . Is the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness? I think openness is the answer. Others clearly disagree.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Not That Kind of ‘Open’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://l.kolide.co/3JWbXEv" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvj" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/18/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40015</id><published> 2023-06-18T20:29:47Z</published><updated> 2023-06-18T20:29:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for their continuing sponsorship support here at DF — they sponsored Daring Fireball last week, and they were the presenting sponsor <a href="https://youtu.be/DgLrBSQ6x7E">at the upcoming The Talk Show Live From WWDC</a> . They&#39;re a great company with a great product.</p><p> Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta. Kolide&#39;s unique approach works with Okta to make device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn&#39;t compliant, users can&#39;t log in to their cloud apps until they&#39;ve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for your IT team, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.</p><p> Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon. <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3XlSqAq">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more and see it in action.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/18/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;An Extra Kick in the Nuts&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/06/17/ep-379" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvi" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/17/the-talk-show-379" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40014</id><published> 2023-06-17T23:28:00Z</published><updated> 2023-06-17T23:28:00Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Abner Li, reporting for 9to5Google:</p><blockquote><p> In an <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/squarespace-enters-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-google-domains-assets-301852507.html?tc=eml_cleartime">unexpected announcement</a> today, <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a> is “winding down following a transition period,” with Squarespace taking over the business and assets.</p><p> Squarespace announced today that it “entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Google, whereby Squarespace will acquire the assets associated with the Google Domains business.” This includes “approximately 10 million domains hosted on Google Domains spread across millions of customers.”</p><p> Google cited “efforts to sharpen our focus” in selling the Google Domains registrar business, which <a href="https://9to5google.com/2014/06/23/google-announces-new-domain-registration-service-currently-invite-only/">launched in 2014</a> as a big proponent of HTTPS and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/10/02/google-page-tld-registry/">top-level domains (TLDs)</a> as of late. The service <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/03/15/google-domains-discount/">exited beta in 2022</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Funny enough, I just used Google Domains for the first time two weeks ago to register a <a href="https://icannwiki.org/.foo">.foo</a> domain name <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo">to use with Bluesky</a> . ( <a href="https://skeeet.xyz?url=https://staging.bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jyd4zjd5ox2y">Very easy to do</a> , and one of Bluesky&#39;s best and most innovative features.) I went to check on it when I saw this news that Google Domains is shutting down, and I had an alert that the new domain name I registered would be put on “hold” <em>today</em> if I didn&#39;t verify the email address I used to register it. I hadn&#39;t seen any verification emails from Google about it. I told Google Domains to send another verification email. Still didn&#39;t see it. Turns out that even though I used an @gmail.com address to register the domain, every single email from Google Domains was being flagged as spam. So Google&#39;s own email service considers all emails from Google&#39;s own domain name service to be spam.</p><p> So, yeah, I&#39;d say Google needs to focus.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Domains Shutting Down, Assets Sold to Squarespace’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/16/google-domains">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jay Peters Interviews Reddit CEO Steve Huffman for The Verge </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762868/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvg" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/16/peters-huffman-interview" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40012</id><published> 2023-06-16T21:50:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-16T21:56:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Christina Warren, writing at Inverse:</p><blockquote><p> But buried in the keynote was a macOS feature that Apple <em>should</em> have called out with more fanfare: DirectX 12 support for macOS. As PC gamers already know, this software support means the floodgates are open for some <em>real</em> games — not that casual <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/what-the-car-first-impressions-triband-apple-arcade">Apple Arcade stuff</a> — on Mac. Maybe, just maybe, this is the beginning of the end to the old joke that Macs can&#39;t play AAA games. [...]</p><p> DirectX 12 support within the Game Porting Toolkit skips right over all of these translations. With zero need to modify any game code, games such as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> , <em>Diablo IV</em> , <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-review">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em> , and <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hogwarts-legacy-unforgivable">Hogwart&#39;s Legacy</a></em> can now run on Apple silicon Macs <em>almost</em> as if they&#39;re native.

<p>David Pierce for The Verge, “Every Smartphone Should Be a Flip Phone, Starting Right Now”:</p><blockquote><p> Okay, so I&#39;ve convinced you, right? Flip phones forever! Here&#39;s the problem: none of the flip phones currently on the market live up to this promise. There aren&#39;t even many to choose from. The Z Flip 4 gets a lot of things right, but it&#39;s held back by a too-small front screen and a just-fine camera setup. The new Razr Plus looks really promising, particularly because of its larger front screen, though its processor and durability ratings aren&#39;t particularly impressive. It also gets the software wrong, I think; letting me run full apps on the front screen isn&#39;t just silly — it runs against the whole appeal of a flip phone.</p><p> What we need is competition. That&#39;s going to take the rest of the smartphone world, from Apple and Google to Huawei and Oppo to Nothing and OnePlus, to all decide that flip phones are the future. They can and should keep working on slab phones and foldables because those have their place and their users. But we had it right in 2003: the best kind of phone is a flip phone. Phones got smarter, and their shape got worse. It&#39;s time for us to finally get the best of both worlds.</p></blockquote><p> I enjoy an honest contrarian take as much as the next person, but I legit don&#39;t get why any company makes one of these, let alone why Pierce would suggest they might go mainstream. Foldables I sort of get, in terms of potential — you carry a double-thick rectangular phone in exchange for a tablet-sized large screen when unfolded. I&#39;ve yet to see one that seems good, but I get the potential for the basic concept — bigger screens are better, all things considered. <em>Westworld</em> ’s super-thin tablets that fold into pocketable phones are the best vision for this I&#39;ve seen, and the best examination of <em>Westworld</em> ’s tablets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek">was published by ... The Verge, back in 2018</a> .</p><p> But a flip phone that folds into a double-thick square? I don&#39;t get it. You gain no reduction in volume or weight, and no increase in usable screen real estate. But now you have an extra step each time you want to use your phone, an additional point of mechanical failure on the device, and a form factor that isn&#39;t compatible with putting your phone in a protective case.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Counterpoint: Flip Phones Are a Dumb Idea’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/flip-phones-dumb-idea">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Time Flies, Reddit-Scale </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uvd" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/14/time-flies-reddit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40009</id><published> 2023-06-14T23:38:58Z</published><updated> 2023-06-15T02:22:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> With just a few taps, you can create links between notes, making it easy to jump from one idea to another.

Tapping it lets you link to another note by searching its title or entering a URL.</p><p> You can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just stick with the original title for clarity.

<p>My thanks to Retool for sponsoring last week at DF. Programming hasn&#39;t fundamentally changed in a long time. Building an app usually means searching for the right component library, debugging dependencies, rewriting a lot of boilerplate code, and figuring out where and how to deploy. Everything but solving the problem at hand.</p><p> Retool is a new approach, unifying the ease of visual programming with the power and flexibility of real code. Connect to any database or API. Use drag-and-drop to design your UI while simultaneously live-programming it. Deploy instantly and scale as you grow. You can use Retool to build web apps, native iOS and Android apps, and automated workflows to help your business run.</p><p> Retool&#39;s customers use it to solve all kinds of business problems 10× faster: Plaid uses Retool to manage integration product support. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. You, too, can use it to manage users and orders, analyze data, run developer operations, or build any other business-critical application, fast. <a href="https://retool.com/?utm_source=sponsor&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball">Start building for free today</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Retool’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/11/retool">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/the_talk_show_live_from_wwdc_2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv8" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40004</id><published> 2023-06-10T18:37:49Z</published><updated> 2023-06-12T00:20:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Back in San Jose&#39;s historic California Theatre for the first time since 2019, special guests John Ternus, Mike Rockwell, Craig Federighi, and Greg Joswiak join me to discuss the news and announcements from WWDC 2023. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The moderators of the popular r/iPhone are taking it private:</p><blockquote><p> Q: <em>What does making r/iPhone private mean, in this case?</em></p><p> A: Taking r/iPhone private means that no-one, except moderators and approved submitters, can see the subreddit&#39;s front page. When attempting to access the subreddit, you will be met with a blank screen stating “r/iPhone has been set to private by its subreddit moderators.”</p><p> Q: <em>What does indefinite mean in this case?</em></p><p> A: Originally, the protest was planned to be 48 hours. However, after a shambolic AMA held by Reddit&#39;s CEO, it has become clear to us that Reddit doesn&#39;t intend to act in good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread libellous claims about another third-party developer, and then try double down by vilifying them, again, in an AMA, despite being proven as a liar by the developer through audio recordings, that&#39;s when we knew what we were up against. Therefore, the subreddit will be privatised until such time as a reasonable resolution is proposed.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/145vns0/the_future_of_rvideos/">The moderators at r/Videos are doing the same</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Q: <em>Won&#39;t Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?</em></p><p> A: This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the “health” of their site is more important to them. We as a team are prepared for this, none of us want to continue to volunteer for a company that disrespects the people who helped build it into the front page of the internet.</p><p> Q: <em>An indefinite lockdown? I thought this was only supposed to be for 48 hours?</em></p><p> A: Originally it was our intention to spread awareness of these issues, but over the past week it has become clear that Reddit doesn&#39;t intend to act in good faith, and our role in the protest became clear. The owners of Reddit have taken their users, community developers, and their moderator teams for granted and used them to build up a multimillion dollar company which is now focused not on the community, but on how many commas they can get out of Silicon Valley investors.</p></blockquote><p> For posterity: screen captures of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/r-iphone-boycott.pdf">r/iPhone</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/06/r-videos-boycott.pdf">r/Videos</a> threads.</p><p> **Update: <a href="https://reddark.untone.uk/">Live-updated list of subreddits going dark or read-only on Monday</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reddit Users Revolt’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/10/reddit-users-revolt">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apollo Is a Work of Art </title><link href="https://mastodon.social/@christianselig/110509739563895220" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv6" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-work-of-art" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40002</id><published> 2023-06-09T23:15:35Z</published><updated> 2023-06-09T23:15:35Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>It&#39;s worth perusing the replies to Apollo developer Christian Selig&#39;s sunsetting announcement <a href="https://mastodon.social/@christianselig/110509739563895220">on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1666857672489189376">Twitter</a> (as well as the long thread <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/">on Reddit itself</a> ).

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> I gotta be honest, this Huffman guy sure looks like a lying creep, and all of Reddit&#39;s public statements about honoring third-party apps seem like an attempt to lie to Redditors so they don&#39;t look like the bad guys. But the bottom line is that Reddit repriced its API in order to bankrupt third-party apps. (Selig says he&#39;ll lose $250,000 in the shutdown.)</p></blockquote><p> It seems pretty clear that all of Huffman&#39;s recent decisions are driven by Reddit&#39;s hoped-for IPO. On one front is the ugly fact that Reddit&#39;s valuation is sinking. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/fidelity-reddit-valuation/">TechCrunch reported last week</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Fidelity, the lead investor in Reddit&#39;s most recent funding round in 2021, has slashed the estimated worth of its equity stake in the popular social media platform by 41% since the investment. [...]</p><p> This devaluation, part of a broader trend that has hit a variety of growth stage startups across the globe in the past year, raises uncertainties about whether Reddit will maintain its initial intent to reportedly go public at a valuation around $15 billion.</p></blockquote><p> On the other front is OpenAI, currently buoyed by a sky-high valuation, and which used Reddit content as part of its massive training data. The whole point of going from free-of-charge to very-expensive with these APIs is to get OpenAI and similar companies to pay for them. It&#39;s a pipe dream. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-openai-chatgpt-ipo-valuation-karma-2023-6">Julie Bort at Insider</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable. But we don&#39;t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free,” said Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit.</p><p> I asked ChatGPT if it is going to pay for Reddit data. It told me its training data cut-off was September 2021 so it didn&#39;t know what was happening after that date.</p></blockquote><p> Reddit already gave all its data to large companies for free. Huffman is trying to charge now for horses that were let out of the barn years ago. And he obviously doesn&#39;t care about Apollo or other third-party Reddit clients, or what these moves do to Reddit&#39;s reputation as a platform vendor. He&#39;s just trapped in a fantasy where investors are going to somehow see Reddit as a player in the current moment of AI hype.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reddit’s Hoped-For IPO and Pipe Dream of Cashing in on OpenAI’s Hype’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/reddit-ipo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Facing Reddit&#39;s Exorbitant API Pricing, Christian Selig Is Shutting Down Apollo </title><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/apollo-reddit-demise" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40000</id><published> 2023-06-09T17:37:06Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T00:49:49Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Christian Selig, writing in r/apolloapp:</p><blockquote><p> Eight years ago, I posted in the Apple subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/">about a Reddit app I was looking for beta testers for</a> , and my life completely changed that day. I just finished university and an internship at Apple, and wanted to build a Reddit client of my own: a premier, customizable, well-designed Reddit app for iPhone. This fortunately resonated with people immediately, and it&#39;s been my full time job ever since.</p><p> Today&#39;s a much sadder post than that initial one eight years ago. June 30th will be Apollo&#39;s last day.</p><p> I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people, and come to terms with this over the last weeks as talks with Reddit have deteriorated to an ugly point, and in the interest of transparency with the community, I wanted to talk about how I arrived at this decision, and if you have any questions at the end, I&#39;m more than happy to answer. This post will be long as I have a lot of topics to cover.</p><p> Please note that I recorded all my calls with Reddit, so my statements are not based on memory, but the recorded statements by Reddit over the course of the year. One-party consent recording is legal in my country of Canada. Also I won&#39;t be naming names, that&#39;s not important and I don&#39;t want to doxx people.</p></blockquote><p> Given what we knew about Reddit&#39;s stance on this API pricing a week ago, this isn&#39;t surprising, but it still feels tragic. Apollo — like Tweetbot and Twitterrific before it — isn&#39;t merely a nice client for a particular service. It&#39;s one of the best apps ever made, full stop.</p><p> Let&#39;s stop attributing this shutdown to “Reddit” the company, though, and pin responsibility where it truly lies: on Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman, personally. When Twitter killed third-party clients everyone naturally and correctly pinned responsibility on Elon Musk, because Musk is very famous and very much public in his stewardship of Twitter now that he owns it.</p><p> I&#39;ll bet many of you reading this, even Reddit users, couldn&#39;t recall Reddit&#39;s CEO&#39;s name before I named Huffman above. But it&#39;s clear from Selig&#39;s description — and his receipts, as it were — that Huffman is intimately involved in this decision, and is not only responsible, but is actively besmirching Selig with provably false accusations of both extortion <em>and</em> shoddy engineering.</p><p> Reddit didn&#39;t kill Apollo. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman did.</p><p> Let&#39;s see if Huffman has the courage to go through with <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/">this planned AMA today to discuss Reddit&#39;s API policy changes</a> .

<p>MG Siegler:</p><blockquote><p> Earlier today, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-inter-miami-mls.html">announced</a> that Lionel Messi, the world&#39;s greatest soccer player, would be leaving Europe behind and joining Inter Miami. This matters because the biggest name in <a href="https://500ish.com/a-most-beautiful-game-e3a3dcbd228d">fútbol</a> (soccer), and arguably in all sports, is coming to America. But it also matters because he&#39;s coming to play in the MLS. A league that has an exclusive television deal with Apple. And as such, Apple apparently helped lure Messi over with an extraordinary offer: a cut of revenue from new subscribers to their Season Pass service.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d be very curious to learn just how big a revenue share Messi is getting from Apple, but regardless of the details, this is simply an extraordinary coup for both MLS and Apple TV+. There are only a handful of athletes who are so good, and so beloved, that they can singlehandedly elevate an entire <em>league</em> in a team sport. Lionel Messi is one of them.</p><blockquote><p> Of the people who got early looks at Vision Pro, there&#39;s seemingly universal praise for the NBA court-side and MLB dugout demos. These were apparently shot with special cameras which Apple manufactured to be able to capture footage that could take full advantage of the viewing experience on the new device. It will likely take a bit for this type of content to become more widespread and accepted amongst the leagues. You know where it won&#39;t be? MLS. <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666535803068256259">I fully expect</a> Apple to be filming games with their new Spatial Cameras (I made up the name, but it seems like something they might use… ) soon, if they haven&#39;t started already! Apple isn&#39;t undercutting any other TV rights here (as they might be with say, the NBA), <a href="https://mgs.blog/skating-to-where-the-soccer-ball-will-be-bc889b8c368">they have exclusive rights</a> . To display any game, any time, <em>anywhere</em> on any device.</p></blockquote><p> It occurred to me after my demo with Vision Pro that it was slightly surprising that Apple included spatial presentations of NBA basketball and MLB baseball, but not MLS soccer — the sport TV+ is most all-in on. (Apple does of course have weekly national broadcasts of MLB with Friday Night Baseball.) But I&#39;ll eat my hat if Apple isn&#39;t planning to broadcast entire MLS games with this technology.</p><blockquote><p> And finally, fifth, much like Apple used AT&amp;T as their exclusive carrier for the iPhone when it launched,</strong"> <a href=”https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1666536683251339272<strong>I could see them</a> using their MLS deal in a similar manner. That is, work with a league/carrier that is willing to break norms and allow Apple to be in control of the product and offering. And when it&#39;s a success, watch the other leagues/carriers trip over themselves to get in line. It worked with the iPhone. Will it work here? Feels like a pretty good bet to make.</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly what I was thinking when I mentioned <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos#fn2-2023-06-07">in a footnote in my first impressions piece this week</a> that the NFL in particular might have made a colossal mistake signing a long-term deal with Google for Sunday Ticket broadcast rights. Siegler&#39;s comparison to how Apple leveraged its initial exclusivity deal with AT&amp;T with the iPhone seems apt.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Apple also announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-scores-with-documentary-series-featuring-legendary-football-champion-lionel-messi-and-his-fifa-world-cup-career-culminating-in-his-dramatic-qatar-2022-win/">a four-part docuseries on Messi&#39;s career</a> coming to TV+.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Lionel Messi Is Coming to MLS, With a Revenue Sharing Deal From Apple’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/09/messi-apple">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uv2" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39998</id><published> 2023-06-07T18:21:22Z</published><updated> 2023-06-10T03:41:45Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I got to spend about 30 minutes Monday afternoon using a Vision Pro and VisionOS at Apple Park, in a temporary “field house” building Apple constructed specifically for this experience. This was a one-on-one guided tour with someone from the Vision product marketing team, with the ground rules that I&#39;m allowed to talk about everything I experienced, but photos and videos were not permitted.</p><p> It was a very fast 30 minutes, and the experience was, in a word, immersive. I&#39;d pay good money just to run through the exact same 30 minutes again.</p><p> It was nowhere near enough time, nor was I able to wander far off the rails of the prepared demos. It&#39;s very clear that the OS and apps are far from finished. But even given the brevity of the demo and constraints of the current state of the software, there are a few things I feel confident about describing.</p><p> First: the overall technology is extraordinary, and far better than I expected. And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">like my friend and Dithering co-host Ben Thompson</a> , my expectations were high. Apple exceeded them. Vision Pro and VisionOS feel like they&#39;ve been pulled forward in time from the future. I haven&#39;t had that feeling about a new product since the original iPhone in 2007. There are several aspects of the experience that felt impossible.</p><p> Is it a compelling <em>product</em> , though? It&#39;s a famous Steve Jobs axiom that technology is not enough, that you don&#39;t make compelling products — let alone entire platforms — starting from advanced technology and working backward. You start with a vision for the product and platform experience and then create new technology to make it real. I simply can&#39;t say whether Vision Pro is going to be a compelling product. I spent too little time with it, the software as of today is too far from complete, and, most importantly, the whole experience is too entirely new and mind-bending to render any such conclusion.</p><p> But the potential for Vision Pro to be a compelling product, across several use cases, is obvious. This might be great. And without question it is interesting, and I think the fundamental conceptual bones Apple has designed for VisionOS lay the groundwork for a long future. The first generation Vision Pro may or may not be a successful product — I simply don&#39;t want to speculate on that front yet. But even just a small taste of VisionOS made me feel confident that it is going to be the next major platform for Apple and Apple developers, alongside MacOS and iOS/iPadOS. <sup id="fnr1-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn1-2023-06-07">1</a></sup></p><hr /><p> A few years ago I stopped wearing contact lenses and have since worn corrective eyeglasses full-time. Before my demo, a rep from Apple took my glasses and used a device to measure my lenses to provide corrective lens inserts for my demo unit. It only took about 3 or 4 minutes. When Vision Pro goes on sale next year, buying corrective lens inserts will probably work like buying eyeglasses online from a retailer like Warby Parker — you&#39;ll provide a copy of your prescription from your eye doctor. It&#39;ll be a slight hassle for us glasses wearers, but not much, and it&#39;s unavoidable. (I see pretty well close up without glasses, so I&#39;m curious how well I might see using Vision Pro without corrective lenses.) After the lens measurement I used an iPhone to do a brief facial scan akin to registering for Face ID (look at the phone, turn your head in a circle), and an ear scan. This test was for identifying a light seal that would best block light, and calibrating the speakers.</p><p> My demo was conducted in a relatively spacious living room. I sat on a couch. My tour guide, as it were, from product marketing sat on an arm chair next to the couch. We took a few minutes to go through the strap adjustments to make it comfortable on my face. My light seal was good, but not perfect. The single biggest downside from my demo experience is that Vision Pro feels heavier on your face than I had hoped it would. It&#39;s not uncomfortable — at least not for 30 minutes — but I never forgot it was there, and it just makes your head feel a bit front-heavy.</p><p> The first run experience wearing Vision Pro requires a few minutes of very simple eye-tracking calibration exercises. You hold your head still, and VisionOS shows a series of dots in front of you, on a pure black background. Moving only your eyes, not your head, you simply look at each dot in front of you as they appear. After a minute or two of that, boom, you&#39;re in.</p><p> What you see at first is just ... your world. You just see the room you&#39;re in. There&#39;s no status information, no metadata, no indicators. Just input from the cameras on the front of the headset, presented on the displays in front of your eyes. It does not magically look indistinguishable from real life, but it does not feel like looking at a screen <em>at all</em> . I perceived absolutely no latency. I definitely could not see pixels — the experience is “retina” quality. Apple is not yet stating what frame rate Vision Pro runs at, but I&#39;m guessing it runs at 90 frames per second, if not higher.</p><p> Again, it doesn&#39;t look at all like looking at screens inside a headset. It looks like reality, albeit through something like a pair of safety glasses or a large face-covering clear shield. There is no border in the field of vision — your field of view through Vision Pro exactly matches what you see through your eyes without it. Most impressively, and uncannily, the field of view seemingly <em>exactly</em> matches what you see naturally. It&#39;s not even slightly wider angle, or even slightly more telephoto. There is no fisheye effect and no aberrations or distortion in your peripheral vision. What you see in front of your face exactly matches what your own eyes see when you lift the Vision Pro up over your eyes. Imagine a set of safety glasses that used a glass treatment that gives the world a slight bit of a “film look”. A slight tint (that tint might get dialed in closer to reality by next year — to me it felt ever so slightly warm, color-wise), and a slight bit of visually flattering smoothness to everything.</p><p> To do anything in VisionOS, you start by single-pressing the digital crown button above your right eye. (The other top button, on the left, will be used to capture spatial photos and videos, but that button was disabled on our demo units yesterday). Press the digital crown button and boom, your home screen of app icons appears in a plane in front of you. Long-press the digital crown button and it re-centers your virtual world in front of whatever you&#39;re now looking at.</p><p> The navigation model of VisionOS is a breakthrough of conceptual simplicity. You simply look at something and tap your index finger and thumb, on either of your hands. I&#39;ll call this “tapping” for lack of a better verb. When you look at any tappable UI element in VisionOS, it is visually highlighted. This highlighting is extremely similar to the hover effect in iPadOS when using a trackpad or mouse. In iPadOS, if you move the mouse pointer circle to a button or icon, that button/icon pops a bit, visually. If you look at a button or icon in VisionOS, that button/icon pops a bit. Some apps have toolbars with a dark background and gray button icons. Look at a button and that button will turn white. Tap your finger and thumb while looking at it and it activates.就是这样。 Incredibly simple, surprisingly effective.</p><p> At first I found myself reaching out to pinch the icons and buttons I saw in front of me. Like if I wanted to activate Safari I&#39;d reach my hand toward the Safari icon and pinch it. That works fine. But it&#39;s completely unnecessary. You really can just leave your hands on your lap. It works when you try to pinch the actual virtual icon in your field of vision because you are looking at the icon, and your finger and thumb do tap, but your hands can be anywhere. All that matters is what you&#39;re looking at. It started feeling natural within just a minute or two, and I could feel myself navigating the interface faster as the demo went on.</p><p> The next most striking aspect of the experience is that everything in VisionOS is completely stable in space. Let&#39;s say you open a Safari window, then open a Messages window next to it. (You can move windows around the room by pinching and dragging on a “Window Bar” that hovers underneath every window. You can move windows left/right, up/down, <em>and</em> closer/further away from you.) Then you turn your head 90 degrees to your side, then turn your head to the other side, and then return your gaze to the center. Those windows for Safari and Messages do not move at all, relative to the real world.一点也不是。 You know how when you use AR on an iPhone or iPad — the built-in Measure app is a perfect example — and virtual UI elements or items move around a little bit relative to reality as you pan and rotate the iPhone or iPad? There&#39;s nothing like that in VisionOS. Virtual elements are utterly stable. Obviously that&#39;s what you <em>want</em> in an XR experience, but to my knowledge no other headset can achieve this stability. My understanding is that this profound stability — this palpable <em>realness</em> of virtual elements — is thanks to the extraordinary precise eye-tracking that Vision Pro achieves. <em>Uncanny</em> is often a pejorative — eg with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> — but in this case I use it as strong praise. It is simply uncanny how Vision Pro makes virtual elements as spatially stable as the walls and furniture and people in the room around you.</p><p> There&#39;s also a top-level “Environments” tab on the left side of the home screen. Everything I&#39;ve described thus far took place in the de facto default “environment” which is your actual surroundings. But the Environments tab allows you to switch from pass-through camera reality to a virtual reality. One of the locations I experienced was Mount Hood. Choose it and it&#39;s like you&#39;re there. These environments are incredibly immersive, 360 degrees. And so instead of catching up on Mail and Messages in floating windows in your living room, you can do it while it appears like you&#39;re atop a mountain, or on a beach, or, well, anywhere. It&#39;s beautiful, and every bit as stable spatially as pass-through reality. When you&#39;re in an immersive environment, you can turn the digital crown to adjust how far it wraps around your field of vision. Fully immersive means you don&#39;t see anything from your actual physical environment; partial immersion dials it back from your periphery to the center, with blurred dream-like edges.</p><p> Lastly, “breakthrough” is Apple&#39;s term for a feature that identifies real human beings who approach you while immersed. They sort of fade in, as transparent ghosts. But not spooky ghosts. It&#39;s a seamless feature, and given my experience with other VR headsets, a necessary one to avoid being isolated from the people around you once you&#39;re immersed. You see someone fade into view, and you can turn the digital crown to dial back the degree of immersion and truly look at them.</p><hr /><p> Apple is <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1665806600261763072">promoting</a> the Vision Pro announcement as the launch of “the era of spatial computing”. That term feels perfect. It&#39;s not AR, VR, or XR. It&#39;s spatial computing, and some <em>aspects</em> of spatial computing are AR or VR.</p><p> To me the Macintosh has always felt more like a <em>place</em> than a <em>thing</em> . Not a place I go physically, but a place my mind goes intellectually. When I&#39;m working or playing and in the flow, it has always felt like MacOS is where I <em>am</em> . I&#39;m in the Mac. Interruptions — say, the doorbell or my phone ringing — are momentarily disorienting when I&#39;m in the flow on the Mac, because I&#39;m pulled out of that world and into the physical one. There&#39;s a similar effect with iOS too, but I&#39;ve always found it less profound. Partly that&#39;s the nature of iOS, which doesn&#39;t speak to me, idiomatically, like MacOS does. I think in many ways that explains why I never feel <em>in the flow</em> on an iPad like I can on a Mac, even with the same size display. But with the iPhone in particular screen size is an important factor. I don&#39;t think <em>any</em> hypothetical phone OS could be as immersive as I find MacOS, simply because even the largest phone display is so small. Watching a movie on a phone is a lesser experience than watching on a big TV set, and watching a movie on even a huge TV is a lesser experience than watching a movie in a nice theater. We humans are visual creatures and our field of view affects our sense of importance. Size matters.</p><p> The <em>worlds</em> , as it were, of MacOS and iOS (or Windows, or Android, or whatever) are defined and limited by the displays on which they run. If MacOS is a place I go mentally when working, that place is manifested physically by the Mac&#39;s display. It&#39;s like the playing field, or the court, in sports — it has very clear, hard and fast, rectangular bounds. It is of fixed size and shape, and everything I do in that world takes place in the confines of those display boundaries.</p><p> VisionOS is very much going to be a conceptual place like that for work. But there is no display. There are no boundaries. The intellectual “place” where the apps of VisionOS are presented is the real-world place in which you use the device, or the expansive virtual environment you choose. The room in which you&#39;re sitting is the canvas. The whole room. The display on a Mac or iOS device is to me like a portal, a rectangular window into a well-defined virtual world. With VisionOS the virtual world is the actual world around you.</p><p> In the same way that the introduction of multitouch with the iPhone removed a layer of conceptual abstraction — instead of touching a mouse or trackpad to move an on-screen pointer to an object on screen, you simply touch the object on screen — VisionOS removes a layer of abstraction spatially. Using a Mac, you are in a physical place, there is a display in front of you in that place, and on that display are application windows. Using VisionOS, there are just application windows in the physical place in which you are. On Monday I had Safari and Messages and Photos open, side by side, each in a window that seemed the size of a movie poster — that is to say, each app in a window that appeared larger than any actual computer display I&#39;ve ever used. All side by side. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Some of the videos in Apple&#39;s Newsroom post</a> introducing Vision Pro illustrate this. But seeing a picture of an actor in this environment doesn&#39;t do justice to experiencing it firsthand, because a photo showing this environment itself has defined rectangular borders.</p><p> This is not confusing or complex, but it feels profound. Last night I chatted with a friend who, I found out only then, has been using Vision Pro for months inside Apple. While talking about this “your real world room is your canvas for arranging your application windows” aspect of the experience, he said that he spent weeks feeling a bit constrained, keeping his open VisionOS windows all in front of him as though on a virtual display, before a colleague opened his mind to <em>spreading out</em> and making applications windows much larger and arranging them in a wider carousel not merely in front of him but <em>around</em> him. The constraints of even the largest physical display simply do not exist with VisionOS.</p><hr /><p> I&#39;d group everything I experienced Monday into three loose categories.</p><p> The first, for lack of a better term, is simply “computing”. Work, as it were. Reading web pages, talking via FaceTime, reading email or messages. Using <em>apps</em> . You start with an iOS-like grid of app icons, tap on apps to open them in windows, and arrange and resize those windows however you want. Text is very readable in windows. My brief 30 minute demo covered a lot, so I have zero perspective on how pleasant or tolerable it is to read for long stretches of time, but my impression is that it&#39;s more than fine. Windows look solid, text looks crisp, and you can make windows really big in virtual space. If anything is going to seem weird or wrong about long-form reading in VisionOS, it&#39;s not the visual fidelity, but rather the fact that I&#39;ve never once in my life read an article or email message in a window that appeared 4 or 5 feet tall.</p><p> The second type of experience is the consumption of 2D content, like photos and videos. Watching a regular movie on a virtual huge screen is incredible. It&#39;s way more like watching a movie in a real cinema than like watching on a TV. One of the movies Apple had us watch was James Cameron&#39;s <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> , both in a window floating in front of us, and then in “theater mode”, which immersively removes your actual physical surroundings. Cameron shot <em>Avatar 2</em> with state-of-the-art 3D cameras, and the 3D effect was, as promised, better than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in a theater or theme park. I don&#39;t generally like 3D feature-length movies at all — I find myself not remembering them afterwards — but I might watch movies like <em>Avatar</em> this way with Vision Pro. But even though <em>Avatar</em> is 3D, it&#39;s still a rectangular movie. It&#39;s just presented as a very large rectangle with very compelling 3D depth inside that rectangle.</p><p> The third type of experience is fully immersive. Content Apple commissioned and created that is inherently only consumable in three dimensions. Full immersion, like transporting you to a cliff&#39;s edge atop a mountain, or lakeside on a beautiful spring day. Some of these immersive environments surround you completely — you can turn around 360 degrees, and look up at the sky or down at the ground (or, dizzyingly, down over the cliff&#39;s edge). Another custom experience involved a portal opening on the wall across the room, out of which first flew a small butterfly that landed on my extended finger. This is so compelling that some of the media people who experienced it had their minds tricked into <em>feeling</em> the butterfly land. I did not, but I can see why they did. Then, a dinosaur — a velociraptor-looking thing, seemingly about 9 or 10 feet tall — approached the “portal” in the wall and came halfway through into the room. I was invited to stand up from the couch and approach it. There was a coffee table in front of the couch, a possible shin-banging accident waiting to happen, but the pass-through video experience is so seamless, so natural, so much like just looking through glasses, not looking at a screen inside a headset, that it took no concentration or carefulness at all on my part to stand up and walk around the coffee table and approach the dinosaur. The dinosaur was not pre-recorded. It reacted, live, to me, keeping eye contact with me at all times. It was spooky, and a significant part of my own lizard brain was instinctively <em>very</em> alarmed. I got extremely close to the dinosaur&#39;s head, and the illusion that it was real never broke down. Even up close, there was no sign that it was composed of polygons stitched together or something. It looked like a 10-foot tall dinosaur that could kill me with a snap of its jaws, right there in the room with me, as close to my face as the MacBook Pro display on which I&#39;m writing these words is right now.</p><p> Spatial photos and videos — photos and videos shot with the Vision Pro itself — are viewed as a sort of hybrid between 2D content and fully immersive 3D content. They don&#39;t appear in a crisply defined rectangle. Rather, they appear with a hazy dream-like border around them. Like some sort of teleportation magic spell in a Harry Potter movie or something. The effect reminded me very much of Steven Spielberg&#39;s <em>Minority Report</em> , in the way that Tom Cruise&#39;s character <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">could obsessively watch “memories” of his son</a> , and the way the psychic “precogs” perceive their visions of murders about to occur. It&#39;s like watching a dream, but through a portal opened into another world.</p><p> Lastly, we saw two sports demos: an at-bat from a baseball game at Fenway Park (Phil Schiller&#39;s hands are all over that one), and a scoring play from a Nuggets-Suns NBA basketball game. For the baseball game, the perspective wasn&#39;t even from the stands, but rather from the home team&#39;s dugout, ground level, right behind first base. It&#39;s not quite <em>just</em> like being there, but it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> like being there. It&#39;s more realistic than seems possible. You choose where to direct your gaze: at the batter at home plate, at the pitcher, or out in the outfield. Or above the outfielders, at the scoreboard. For the NBA game, the perspective was courtside, right behind the basket. But better than the actual courtside perspective, because the perspective was slightly elevated above seating level. Fully immersive, fully three-dimensional, and seemingly perfectly to scale. Kevin Durant looked about 6&#39;10&quot;, right in front of me. Getting the scale just right is obviously the correct way to present this, but it seems devilishly tricky to actually pull off. Apple has pulled it off. These baseball and basketball scenes were shot by Apple using entirely custom camera rigs, and stored in altogether new file formats. This is nothing at all like 2D footage extrapolated into 3D, or just painted on a virtual circular wall around you. It looks real. It seems as profoundly different from watching regular TV telecasts of sports as TV telecasts are from audio-only radio broadcasts. <sup id="fnr2-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn2-2023-06-07">2</a></sup> It was incredible. I would genuinely consider buying a Vision Pro if the one and only thing it did was show entire sporting events like this.</p><p> The first two types of experiences — doing computer “work”, and watching 2D and 2D-ish 3D content, have analogs to existing experiences. Using Safari in VisionOS is like using Safari on a Mac or iPad, but with a different presentation. Watching a movie in VisionOS is just watching a movie, albeit with the completely convincing illusion that you&#39;re looking at an enormous room-filling cinema screen. But the third, these original immersive experiences, have no analogs except to the real world. It&#39;s extraordinary, and only possible because Apple has gotten so many little things so exactly right.</p><p> I walked away from my demo more than a bit discombobulated. Not because it was disorienting or even the least bit nauseating, but because it was so unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. It strikes me that in some ways Bob Iger&#39;s cameo during the keynote had the relationship between Apple and Disney backwards. Iger spent his keynote cameo talking about Disney creating original new content for VisionOS&#39;s new medium. But after experiencing it, it felt more like what Disney should want is Apple providing this technology for Disney to use in their theme parks. The sports and dinosaur demos I experienced using Vision Pro were in many ways more immersive and thrilling than tentpole major attractions I&#39;ve experienced at Disney World.</p><p> Are you going to want to buy a Vision Pro for $3,500? That price is high enough that the answer is probably not, for most of you, no matter how compelling it is. But are you going to want to try one out for an hour or two, and find yourself craving another hour or two? I guarantee it. You need to see it. <sup id="fnr3-2023-06-07"><a href="#fn3-2023-06-07">3</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-06-07"><p> I mean no disrespect to WatchOS or even tvOS by leaving them off that list.

<p>Science fiction writer Ted Chiang, in an interview with Madhumita Murgia for The Financial Times ( <a href="https://archive.is/2023.06.04-050658/https://www.ft.com/content/c1f6d948-3dde-405f-924c-09cc0dcf8c84">Archive.is link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Chiang&#39;s main objection, a writerly one, is with the words we choose to describe all this. Anthropomorphic language such as “learn”, “understand”, “know” and personal pronouns such as “I” that AI engineers and journalists project on to chatbots such as ChatGPT create an illusion. This hasty shorthand pushes all of us, he says — even those intimately familiar with how these systems work — towards seeing sparks of sentience in AI tools, where there are none.</p><p> “There was an exchange on Twitter a while back where someone said, &#39;What is artificial intelligence?&#39; And someone else said, &#39;A poor choice of words in 1954&#39;,” he says. “And, you know, they&#39;re right. I think that if we had chosen a different phrase for it, back in the &#39;50s, we might have avoided a lot of the confusion that we&#39;re having now.”</p><p> So if he had to invent a term, what would it be? His answer is instant: applied statistics.</p></blockquote><p> My puerile mind is tempted to make a joke that tacking on “system” would make for a fun acronym, but I shan&#39;t crack that joke, as I think Chiang makes a strong point here. What we have with these LLMs isn&#39;t low-level intelligence but rather high-level applied statistics that creates the powerful illusion of low-level intelligence.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> Chiang&#39;s very short story “ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a">What&#39;s Expected of Us</a> ”, referenced in the interview.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ted Chiang on AI: ‘The Machines We Have Now Are Not Conscious’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/04/chiang-ai">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Sky Guide </title><link href="https://www.fifthstarlabs.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uux" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/03/sky-guide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.39993</id><published> 2023-06-04T02:15:33Z</published><updated> 2023-06-04T02:15:34Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/1659593595643662336-vhv6gL8w">Ben Bajarin on Twitter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If Apple is releasing a VR/AR headset this year, it makes more sense for a dedicated event or bundle it with a Mac event in the fall.</p><p> There is too much ground to cover at WWDC, and 30 min is not enough to tell the full product story.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been thinking about this too. The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple&#39;s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we&#39;re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it&#39;s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that&#39;s an easy announcement: it&#39;s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it&#39;s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850">Last year&#39;s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos">here&#39;s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p><p> But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There&#39;s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn&#39;t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn&#39;t. They might have ideally wanted to announce it <em>before</em> this year&#39;s WWDC at a special event, but if they want developers to start creating software for the platform, this is the time. (And why wouldn&#39;t they want developers to start working on ideas?)</p><p> Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p><p> Here&#39;s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren&#39;t just pre-recorded, they&#39;re very tightly edited. I suspect we&#39;ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It&#39;ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem.

Anything and everything from the OSes might get cut to make time for the headset, xrOS, and Mac hardware announcements. There&#39;s a whole second State of the Union technical keynote in the afternoon where features cut from the main morning keynote can go. <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-19"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ On Apple Fitting a Headset Announcement Into the Always-Packed WWDC Keynote </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/do_wall_street_journal_reporters_read_the_wall_street_journal" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/ut6" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.39930</id><published> 2023-05-19T01:41:49Z</published><updated> 2023-05-20T00:34:04Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> In a sense, Apple *does* have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make the first one good enough to be criticized. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie, reporting last week for The Wall Street Journal, “ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-is-breaking-its-own-rules-with-a-new-headset-80c9b36c">Apple Is Breaking Its Own Rules With a New Headset</a> ” ( <a href="https://apple.news/AdSGSL1h8RBa5WioRJe_T9g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s launch plans break many of its traditions and rules about new products that have become the industry gold standard. Unlike other Apple products, the device is debuting in a still-experimental mode. Apple predicts slower adoption for the headset compared with the Apple Watch or the iPhone, both of which quickly became consumer must-haves. Taking seven years in development before hitting the market, it will be one of the most complex consumer products any company has ever sold.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a lot to unpack in one paragraph. Here goes:</p><p> I&#39;d argue Apple has never introduced two new products the same way. Every new product introduction has been different. I honestly don&#39;t know any more about the headset than the rumor mill consensus but I guarantee it isn&#39;t in an “experimental mode”. Neither Apple Watch nor iPhone “quickly became consumer must-haves”. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">Here&#39;s a report from Daisuke Wakabayashi</a> in ... <em>checks notes</em> ... The Wall Street Fucking Journal itself in April 2016, a year after Apple Watch shipped, that says, in the opening paragraph, “Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple&#39;s most popular devices: disappointment.” (The next paragraph claimed that “sales of iPhones are slowing”.) <sup id="fnr1-2023-05-18"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-18">1</a></sup></p><p> The pattern for Apple&#39;s entries into new product categories generally goes like this:</p><ul><li> Apple releases the first version. It&#39;s expensive. It&#39;s missing a few obvious features. It has a few obvious limitations. But it&#39;s a breakthrough.</li><li> Early adopters wait in line outside Apple Stores overnight to buy it. Online sales are backordered by weeks or even months soon after they launch.</li><li> That early fervor aside, it&#39;s an early adopter product, and sales are less than those of Apple&#39;s established products.</li><li> After a few months or maybe a year, the immediate-gratification-obsessed business press runs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">articles</a> declaring the product a dud.</li><li> Apple releases a second-gen version that&#39;s better. Sales go up. Word continues to spread.</li><li> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">With each successive year</a> , Apple releases improved models. Those obvious missing features are added. The obvious limitations are removed. Older models stay on sale at lower price points. It becomes a hit product.</li><li> Years later, when Apple is poised to release another altogether new product, the last one — the one written off as a dud after its first year — is held up as a product that was universally hailed as a sensation and smash hit from day one.</li></ul><p> A few paragraphs later in Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie&#39;s report:</p><blockquote><p> For Apple&#39;s first new major product in a decade — the Apple Watch was announced in 2014 — Chief Executive Tim Cook has a lot on the line as the device attempts to dominate the virtual world where people spend time for work or leisure, called the metaverse, which hasn&#39;t yet reached mass adoption or understanding.</p><p> There is growing skepticism among some investors and potential future partners that consumers will spend money and time on the metaverse. They note some early adopters are disillusioned with the technology.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s a sidenote perhaps, but I&#39;d argue that AirPods are a major new product — and that AirPods Pro are the first true mass-market augmented reality devices. The fact that they&#39;re audio-only, and not visual, blinds people (sorry) to the fact that they&#39;re <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/10/airpods_pro_first_impressions">remarkable AR products</a> . Apple doesn&#39;t break out unit sales, but estimates suggest that if AirPods — just AirPods — were a standalone company, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">it would have more revenue</a> than Nvidia, Adobe, or Uber, and might soon catch up to Netflix. But that&#39;s a sidenote.</p><p> The bigger issue is that back in October, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/26/stern-federighi-joz">in an on-stage interview</a> , Greg Joswiak was asked to complete the sentence “The metaverse is...”, and his answer was, “...a word I&#39;ll never use.” The fact that people don&#39;t use or even know what the hell the metaverse means is irrelevant to Apple&#39;s headset. I don&#39;t know how much more clear Joz could have been without revealing Apple&#39;s headset then and there — <em>Apple&#39;s not making something that&#39;s just like what other companies already have on the market</em> . That on-stage interview was with ... <em>checks notes</em> ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ugwoEOMvg">Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference</a> . It&#39;s enough to make you think Wall Street Journal reporters don&#39;t read The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> That no XR headset introduced so far has made much of a dent in the universe isn&#39;t a sign that Apple&#39;s effort is ill-fated. It&#39;s a sign that Apple has an opportunity. In a sense, Apple <em>does</em> have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">the first one good enough to be criticized</a> .</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-05-18"><p> Here&#39;s a paragraph for the Annals of Prognostication from that same 2016 Wakabayashi report for the Journal:</p><blockquote><p> And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a “flop.” Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn&#39;t be a “home run” like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn&#39;t want to wear a computer on their wrist.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/fred-wilson-predictions">Fred Wilson</a> , the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/05/wilson">next best thing</a> to <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/10/cnbcs-jim-cramer-touted-silicon-valley-bank-stock/">Jim Cramer</a> . <a href="#fnr1-2023-05-18"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Do Wall Street Journal Reporters Read The Wall Street Journal?</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
