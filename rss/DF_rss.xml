<p>Bill Gates, commemorating Microsoft&#39;s 50th anniversary:</p><blockquote><p> The story of how Microsoft came to be begins with, of all things, a magazine. The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured an Altair 8800 on the cover. The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics company called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal computer kit that promised to bring computing power to hobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two things: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted to get in on the ground floor.</p><p> At the time, personal computers were practically non-existent. Paul and I knew that creating software that let people program the Altair could revolutionize the way people interacted with these machines. So, we reached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS, and told him we had a version of the programming language BASIC for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p><p> There was just one problem: We didn&#39;t.<br/> It was time to get to work.</p></blockquote><p> At the bottom Gates links to a printout of the original source code for the BASIC interpreter, in extensively commented assembly language.

<p>Wonderfully detailed write-up of a perfect prop from Make3:</p><blockquote><p> Repurposed Nagra Knobs &amp; Switches — To ground the device in a tangible, vintage aesthetic, we salvaged original knobs and switches from a 1990s Nagra IV-D recorder, seamlessly integrating them into our design.

<p>Jason Snell, last month:</p><blockquote><p> The new M4 MacBook Air is the Mac most people should buy. [...]</p><p> That&#39;s why perhaps the most important change in the M4 MacBook Air is its base configuration, which starts at $999. When Apple introduced a winning new flat-with-rounded-corners Air design in 2022, it had to keep selling older models in order to get down under a thousand dollars. Three years later, Apple is finally able to sell a brand-new Air — with a generous 16GB of unified memory — at that important price.</p><p> So: No more quibbles about stepping back a generation or two to an older model with a lower price. Apple has done away with that strategy for the MacBook Air: The latest and greatest model is the one most people shopping for a Mac should buy, especially if they&#39;re coming from an Intel model.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d put off linking to Snell&#39;s review for a few weeks while thinking about writing my own, but I&#39;ve got nothing to add. The M4 MacBook Air is utterly unsurprising, but only in the best possible way. It&#39;s the MacBook Air everyone wanted Apple to make. The $999 base model is now exceedingly recommendable. It even brings back the most notable feature that was lost in the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon — the ability to drive two external displays <em>and</em> its own internal display. Just aces all around.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell’s M4 MacBook Air Review’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/snell-m4-macbook-air">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> US Transaction Shares for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/visa-wanted-a-vast-empire-first-it-had-to-beat-back-its-foes-3b3067f3?mod=article_inline" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41775</id><published> 2025-04-03T23:34:50Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T23:35:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">the previous item</a> , here&#39;s a WSJ report from October on Visa&#39;s dominant position in the payments industry:</p><blockquote><p> Visa, based in San Francisco, has built its network over more than 60 years — going back to clunky manual credit-card readers and carbon-paper copies of receipts. It accounts for around 60% of the total dollar amount of US debit-card purchases and about 50% of US credit-card purchases, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication. Its closest competitor, Mastercard, accounts for around 22% and 23%, respectively. Visa&#39;s profit totaled $17.3 billion in its 2023 fiscal year, after more than tripling in the last decade.</p></blockquote><p> Amex accounts for about 19% of US credit card transactions (and doesn&#39;t support debit), and Discover is down around 3 or 4%. I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it&#39;s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘U.S. Transaction Shares for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> WSJ: Visa Offers Apple Roughly $100 Million to Switch Apple Card&#39;s Network From Mastercard </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-card-visa-mastercard-deal-3ce762da" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41774</id><published> 2025-04-03T23:15:38Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T23:28:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>AnnaMaria Andriotis, reporting for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AMIc70z-kQ4-ghz686tbG3Q">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> The Apple card is up for grabs because Goldman Sachs, the bank behind it, is getting out of the consumer lending world. For months, big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial have been vying to take over as issuer. What hasn&#39;t been known is the equally fierce fight playing out between the networks to win Apple, with Visa and American Express trying to unseat Mastercard, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p> Apple is expected to select a network for the card before it picks the bank to replace Goldman Sachs. Networks provide the plumbing that transmit information between the banks that issue consumers&#39; cards and the merchants&#39; banks.</p><p> Visa, the largest network, has made an aggressive pitch to win the card, including offering the kind of upfront payment to Apple that&#39;s normally reserved for the biggest card programs, the people said. Visa offered a similar payment when Costco was selecting its network about a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p> American Express is also in the mix, trying to become both the issuer and network of the Apple card, the people said. Goldman had approached Amex to gauge its interest in taking over the card in 2023, the Journal earlier reported.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve always thought Visa and Mastercard were interchangeable. I can&#39;t recall ever once in my life seeing an establishment where one of them was accepted but the other wasn&#39;t, and they both seem to be accepted everywhere that accepts credit cards at all. If there&#39;s a reason to prefer one over the other I&#39;ve never heard it.</p><p> Amex is different because it&#39;s accepted at fewer locations because they charge merchants a higher fee, which they get away with because they offer their customers superior service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">I wrote back in 2023</a> that they share an affinity with Apple: both are built around the idea of offering a premium experience and charging higher prices for it.</p><p> But I already have a regular Amex card. One of the things I like about Apple Card being a Mastercard (or if they switched to Visa) is that it&#39;s a card I can use anywhere that doesn&#39;t accept Amex.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘WSJ: Visa Offers Apple Roughly $100 Million to Switch Apple Card’s Network From Mastercard’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Trump Declares a Trade War on Uninhabited Islands, US Military, and Economic Logic&#39; </title><link href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/03/trump-declares-a-trade-war-on-uninhabited-islands-us-military-and-economic-logic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-techdirt" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41773</id><published> 2025-04-03T20:37:36Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T20:37:37Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mike Masnick has a great piece at TechDirt running down just how <em>stupid</em> everything about Trump&#39;s tariff trade war is:</p><blockquote><p> Whoever on the Council of Economic Advisers used this formula should turn in their econ degree, because this is not how anything works. Even if they then go on to <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations">publish another version</a> of the formula that looks all sophisticated and shit.</p></blockquote><p> Brendan Duke, on X, shows that the fancier version of their formula — which is fancy in the way that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/vertu-still-selling-phones">Vertu phones</a> are “fancy” — <a href="https://x.com/Brendan_Duke/status/1907741651172311353">is even stupider</a> , because the two Greek letters they chose to glam it up just cancel each other out.</p><p> Back to Masnick:</p><blockquote><p> This is what happens when you ask ChatGPT to “make my wrong econ math look more scientific.” The document even admits that they couldn&#39;t figure out the actual tariff rates, so they “proxied” them with this formula instead. That&#39;s a bit like saying you couldn&#39;t find your house keys, so you proxied them with a banana.</p><p> The fundamental problem here isn&#39;t just that the tariff numbers are wrong — though they absolutely are. It&#39;s that the entire premise rests on treating trade deficits as if they were tariffs. They&#39;re not the same thing. At all.</p><p> Let&#39;s back up for a moment and talk about trade deficits, because Trump has been getting this wrong for longer than some of his supporters have been alive. His logic appears to be:</p><ol><li> “Deficit” sounds bad</li><li> Therefore, trade deficits must be bad</li><li> Therefore, countries with whom we have trade deficits must be cheating us</li><li> Therefore, we should punish them with tariffs to “level the playing field”</li></ol></blockquote><p> This sounds like it must be an exaggeration for comic effect, but it&#39;s not. That&#39;s how Trump&#39;s mind works. This is what Trump has been <em>saying</em> about trade deficits for decades. It&#39;s like how he understands “asylum” to mean “insane asylum” and so when he talks about <em>political</em> asylum <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-hannibal-lecter-rant-origin.html">he starts talking about “the late great Hannibal Lecter”</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Trump Declares a Trade War on Uninhabited Islands, US Military, and Economic Logic’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-techdirt">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Economist on Trump&#39;s Mindless Tariffs </title><link href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/04/03/president-trumps-mindless-tariffs-will-cause-economic-havoc" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8c" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/the-economist-on-trumps-mindless-tariffs" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41772</id><published> 2025-04-03T19:54:59Z</published><updated> 2025-04-03T19:54:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The Economist:</p><blockquote><p> On economics Mr Trump&#39;s assertions are flat-out nonsense. The president says tariffs are needed to close America&#39;s trade deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet as any of the president&#39;s economists could have told him, this overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than their country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for over three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs should eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with every trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that each of its suppliers is also a customer.</p><p> And Mr Trump&#39;s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a country&#39;s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax.

<p>CNBC:</p><blockquote><ul><li> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/stock-market-today-live-updates-trump-tariffs.html">Markets plunged</a> the day after President Donald Trump imposed a far-reaching “reciprocal tariff” policy, including a 10% baseline tariff on almost every country on earth.</li><li> The plan slaps much steeper tariff rates on many countries, including 34% on China, 20% on the European Union, 46% on Vietnam and 32% on Taiwan.</li><li> Economists and US trade partners <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">are raising questions</a> about how the White House calculated the tariff rates it claimed other countries “charge” the United States.</li></ul></blockquote><p> Apple, in particular, is taking it on the chin, about 9.5% for the day. Amazon and Meta were both down 9%. Nike is down over 13%. From CNBC&#39;s corresponding story on just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/how-did-the-us-arrive-at-its-tariff-figures-.html">how the White House computed the “tariff” rates</a> it claims for various countries:</p><blockquote><p> Many observers said the US appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.</p><p> Such methodology doesn&#39;t necessarily align with the conventional approach for calculating tariffs and implies the US would have looked at only the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.</p></blockquote><p> “Such methodology doesn&#39;t necessarily align with the conventional approach” is an overlong euphemism for “The president literally doesn&#39;t understand what tariffs are.” James Surowiecki was seemingly <a href="https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1907559189234196942">the first person to figure out the White House&#39;s nonsensical formula</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Just figured out where these fake tariff rates come from. They didn&#39;t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country&#39;s exports to us.</p><p> So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us. What extraordinary nonsense this is.</p></blockquote><p> Don&#39;t rack your brain trying to make sense out of the nonsensical.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Trump Tariffs, Day Two’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Nintendo Switch 2 Details </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w8a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-details" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41770</id><published> 2025-04-02T15:35:01Z</published><updated> 2025-04-02T15:35:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

We also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">more hardware details and specs to pore over</a> , like a 1080p, 120Hz 7.9-inch LCD screen, Joy-Con controllers with mouse-like functions, 256GB of storage, and 4K output via the dock.</p><p> Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">cleared up the mysteries about the system&#39;s “C” button</a> with details about new GameChat features and a camera accessory and confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online,</a> along with a dedicated controller.</p><p> Last but not least, Nintendo showed off a number of new games, like a Switch 2 edition of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and the exclusive Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> .</p></blockquote><p> People are going to object to the pricing, but the world has changed (and inflated) since the original Switch debuted in 2017.

<p>Jon Brodkin, reporting for Ars Technica, “ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/france-fines-apple-e150m-for-excessive-pop-ups-that-let-users-reject-tracking/">France Fines Apple €150M for “Excessive” Pop-Ups That Let Users Reject Tracking</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> France&#39;s competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying the iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up messages that let users consent to or reject tracking that third-party applications use for targeted advertising.</p><p> The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue, said a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">press release</a> today by the Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system harms “smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,” the agency said.</p><p> User consent obtained via the ATT framework “authorizes the application in question to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes,” the agency said. “If consent is given, the application can access the Identifier for Advertisers (&#39;IDFA&#39;), the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use of third-party applications and sites.” The French investigation was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry associations.</p></blockquote><p> Ben Lovejoy, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/31/apple-bizarrely-fined-162m-for-app-tracking-transparency-after-advertisers-complained/">correctly calling the decision “bizarre” at 9to5Mac</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Complaints were made <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/apple-app-tracking/">in a number of countries</a> — some arguing that it was unfair because <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/14/app-tracking-transparency-antitrust/">Apple exempts its own apps</a> (which are in reality subject to even tighter controls), others saying the loss of revenue <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/13/app-tracking-transparency-increases-in-app-purchase-prices/">forced developers to raise prices</a> to compensate. [...]</p><p> Although expected, the decision is still inexplicable. ATT involves precisely <em>one</em> popup asking a simple yes/no question. Additionally, Apple lets users switch on a toggle (shown above) to block apps from even asking the question. It&#39;s especially odd given that ATT is a privacy feature, and Europe has the strongest privacy laws in the world. The EU <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/03/ad-tracking-rules/">has also previously vindicated</a> Apple&#39;s introduction of ATT.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s not inexplicable or odd if you view the decision as coming from a perspective where government bureaucracy is viewed as an inherent good, and well-intentioned process is all that matters, not actual results. Read the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> ’s decision ( <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">which they helpfully do make available in English</a> ) and it&#39;s pretty clear:</p><blockquote><p> The <em>Autorité</em> found that the ATT framework imposed by Apple is not necessary, insofar as the consent obtained is not valid under the applicable laws, in particular the French Data Protection Act.</p><p> In practice, the fact that publishers that so wish cannot rely on the ATT framework to comply with their legal obligations means that they must continue to use their own consent collection solutions, known as consent management platforms (“CMPs”). The result is that multiple consent pop-ups are displayed, making the use of third-party applications in the iOS environment excessively complex, as observed by the French data protection authority ( <em>Commission nationale de l&#39;informatique et des libertés</em> — CNIL) in a 2022 opinion issued at the request of the <em>Autorité</em> .</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s ostensibly “not necessary” because French and EU privacy laws are supposedly enough, and all that&#39;s needed. And it&#39;s unfair because now, under ATT, third-party surveillance advertisers who seek to track users across apps on iOS need to ask permission twice — first through the clear-as-a-bell “Ask App Not to Track” / “Allow Tracking” prompt required by Apple, and again through the byzantine but ultimately toothless permission requirements of France and the EU. ATT has had measurable effects because users understand it, and they prefer not to be tracked. EU and French privacy laws are largely ineffective because, in practice, they <a href="https://hep.physics.illinois.edu/home/g-gollin/1984_commercial_dialogue.html">bury users with confusion</a> . The bureaucratic hurdles they impose are to the benefit, not detriment, of the surveillance ad industry. That&#39;s now proven out by industry groups — the ones ATT successfully tempered — successfully getting France&#39;s regulators to penalize Apple. <em>Users</em> don&#39;t know how to lobby government bureaucracies. What the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> is saying, in so many words, is that two layers of consent is too much, and the only one that&#39;s necessary is the one that advertising lobbying groups <em>don&#39;t object to</em> , not the one they do (but which users understand and like).</p><p> It&#39;s clear that only one of these two things — Apple&#39;s ATT or French/EU privacy regulations — was actually effective at reducing tracking: ATT. No one claimed that French or EU privacy laws resulted in Meta losing a fortune because they had to adjust their kleptomaniacal thievery of users&#39; privacy. But by all accounts, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/">including Meta&#39;s own</a> , <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/04/23/apple-just-issued-stunning-12-billion-blow-to-facebook/">ATT cost Meta billions</a> . And yes, ATT hurt small businesses too — small businesses that were built upon surreptitious tracking that users had neither awareness of nor control over. It&#39;s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a popular retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers&#39; business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.</p><p> App Tracking Transparency actually accomplished, in practice, via user-focused plain-language consent, what the EU&#39;s privacy laws were intended to do but do not. This fine boils down to France declaring that Apple shouldn&#39;t have actually done what the EU was pretending to do. They&#39;re acting at the behest of the very developers and advertising companies who were (and still are) trying to conduct cross-app tracking that App Tracking Transparency successfully gave <em>users</em> some control over.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ France Fines Apple $162M for App Tracking Transparency, Taking the Side of Surveillance Advertisers Over Users</title></entry><entry><title> Release Day for Apple&#39;s .4 OS Versions </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/31/ios-18-4-now-available-heres-whats-new/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w84" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/31/release-day-dot-four-versions" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41764</id><published> 2025-03-31T18:23:39Z</published><updated> 2025-03-31T20:34:44Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Brian Steinberg and Pat Saperstein, reporting for Variety over the weekend:</p><blockquote><p> The White House Correspondents&#39; Association has canceled plans to have comedian Amber Ruffin perform at its annual dinner on April 26, a new sign of the pressures being brought to bear on news organizations during President Donald Trump&#39;s second term.</p><p> The journalism group, which has seen its control over interactions with Trump eroded in recent weeks, made the decision after Taylor Budowich, a White House deputy chief of staff, raised comments Ruffin has made in the past that are critical of Trump. Earlier this week, Ruffin told a podcast backed by The Daily Beast that she would not try to make sure her jokes targeted all sides of the political spectrum as the WHCA had requested, and likened the Trump administration to “kind of a bunch of murderers.” Playing to both sides “makes them feel like human beings,” she said, “cause they&#39;re not.” [...]</p><p> “The WHCA board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring a comedic performance this year. At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists,” WHCA president Eugene Daniels wrote to members in a statement.</p><p> “For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year,” he added. “As the date nears, I will share more details of the plans in place to honor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent media covering the most powerful office in the world.”</p></blockquote><p> What an enormous mountain of obvious horseshit this explanation is. The WHCA only announced that Ruffin would be hosting this year&#39;s show on February 4, at which point this lickspittle clown Eugene Daniels <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/amber-ruffin-2025-white-house-correspondents-dinner-1236126815/">was quoted thus by The Hollywood Reporter</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “When I began to think about what entertainer would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year, Amber was immediately at the top of my list,” Eugene Daniels of Politico, president of the association, said in a statement on Tuesday. “She has the ability to walk the line between blistering commentary and humor all while provoking her audience to think about the important issues of the day. I&#39;m thrilled and honored she said yes.”</p></blockquote><p> So eight weeks ago this obsequious bootlicker Daniels thought Amber Ruffin “would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year” but now, four weeks before the show, he&#39;s trying to claim with a straight face that “For the past couple of weeks, I have been planning a re-envisioning of our dinner tradition for this year”?</p><p> The kids magazine Highlights for Children has a long-running comic strip called “Goofus and Gallant”, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/06/goofus-and-gallant-american-parenting-highlights/674536/">the premise of which</a> is that Goofus is a kid who always does the wrong thing, and Gallant always does the right thing. Goofus, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/goofus-gallant-1948.jpg">especially in the older strips</a> , is an absurd parody. This Eugene Daniels toady is the Goofus of journalism. The entire point of the WHCA is to assert the group&#39;s collective independence as journalists — and the independence they assert is specifically from the White House. So of course they shouldn&#39;t have responded to White House pressure to fire Ruffin as this year&#39;s host. But it&#39;s even worse for an ostensible journalist — the president of the WHCA for chrissakes — to try to get even a single person in the world to believe that this is anything other than caving to White House pressure, and that in fact (“ <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRKhdQnd-k">Yeah, that&#39;s the ticket!</a></em> ”) he&#39;d been planning to cancel the entire concept of having a comedian host at all “for the past couple of weeks” when just eight weeks ago he described Ruffin as “a perfect fit for the dinner this year”.</p><p> This is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/baghdad-bob-and-his-ridiculous-true-predictions/274241/">Baghdad Bob</a> level nonsense. I&#39;m not one for performative resignations, but how does any news outlet or journalist agree to remain a member of the WHCA after this?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The White House Correspondents Association Speaks Cowardice to Power’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/31/whca-speaks-cowardice-to-power">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Lex.Games </title><link href="https://lex.games/df" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w80" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/lex-games" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41760</id><published> 2025-03-30T22:25:00Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T22:30:17Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Lex Friedman for sponsoring this past week at DF to promote Lex.Games, a collection of eight daily word games. Quoting from Friedman&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/lexgames_free_daily_word_games">own description in the sponsored RSS entry</a> at the start of the week:</p><blockquote><p> I paid Gruber many thousands of dollars to run this ad for free games which themselves have no ads. Please keep reading.</p><p> The games:</p><p> <em>Conlextions:</em> Inspired by NYT&#39;s Connections<br/> <em>Lexicogs:</em> Solve crossword-style clues by assembling letter “cogs”<br/> <em>By a Vowel:</em> A word jumble game with missing vowels<br/> <em>Six Appeal:</em> Wordle with six-letter words</p><p> There&#39;s also a daily <em>Mini Crossword</em> ; a <em>Full-Size Crossword</em> ; and <em>Mind Control</em> , which is a whole lot like Mastermind and not actually a word game at all; don&#39;t sue me.</p><p> Oh, and if you only counted seven games here, the eighth is iOS-only. It&#39;s called Letter Opener, and it&#39;s my favorite.</p></blockquote><p> I actually hate Letter Opener, because I&#39;m terrible at games like that. Looking at the leaderboard, though, obviously some of you are really good at it. Six Appeal is more my speed (which is to say, like Wordle, it has no clock). But go ahead and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lex-games-daily-word-games/id6498941705">download the iOS app and try Letter Opener</a> . Maybe you&#39;re a fast enough thinker for it.</p><p> So the basic pitch is that Lex.Games really is just a bunch of fun daily games that are free to play, without ads (let alone without <em>annoying</em> ads). But you can — and should! — pay a modest $20/year to subscribe to get access to extra games, leaderboards, and just to support a very fun and satisfying endeavor.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Lex.Games’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/lex-games">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Vertu Is Still Selling Phones, Which Suggests Someone Is Still Buying Them </title><link href="https://vertu.com/product-category/phones/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w82" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/vertu-still-selling-phones" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41762</id><published> 2025-03-30T22:24:30Z</published><updated> 2025-03-31T15:47:10Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>With season 2 of <em>Severance</em> complete (with a remarkable bang), Apple TV+ has slid right into a new prestige series, <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/247767-the-studio?language=en-US">The Studio</a></em> , starring (and co-created by) Seth Rogen as the newly-appointed chief of the fictional and dysfunctional Continental Studios in Hollywood.</p><p> Two episodes in (out of 10 for the debut season), and it is fucking amazing. So far it feels a bit like a cross between <em>Entourage</em> , <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em> , <em>Boogie Nights</em> , and maybe a touch of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> . But the biggest influence and inspiration is clearly Robert Altman&#39;s 1992 masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10403-the-player?language=en-US">The Player</a></em> , almost certainly the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood moviemaking that ever was or will be made.</p><p> What <em>The Studio</em> and <em>The Player</em> share is that they&#39;re about the struggle to create great cinematic art within a corporate studio world run by unartistic know-it-all self-important status-obsessed dullards driven by formula and fads — and, simultaneously, they are themselves almost unfathomably complicated and intricate works of cinematic art. They <em>are</em> what they&#39;re <em>about</em> . They achieve what the characters within them fear is no longer achievable. When you get to episode 2 of <em>The Studio</em> , just keep asking yourself “Wait, <em>how</em> are they getting this shot?” The lighting, my god. The whole thing is just an outpouring of homage to <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/opening-shots-the-player">the opening shot of <em>The Player</em></a> , which of course itself calls back, <a href="https://filmotomy.com/quiet-on-the-set-breaking-down-the-opening-shot-in-altmans-the-player/">explicitly</a> , to Orson Welles&#39;s <em>Touch of Evil</em> .</p><p> <em>The Studio</em> is, thus far, engaging, surprising, funny, gorgeous, clever, and cinematically ambitious. It&#39;s really quite a thing. I have no idea what&#39;s coming in episodes 3–10, so maybe this piece will look a bit premature, if not foolish, in two months. But if the rest of season one is anything like the first two episodes, <em>The Studio</em> is a classic in the making.</p><p> The thought also occurs to me that this might be the don&#39;t-over-think-it answer to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/apple-tv-spend-loss-or-cost">just what the hell Apple is doing making original shows and movies</a> in the first place. Perhaps Apple&#39;s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but <em>champions</em> . And that in a media landscape where such champions of cinema-as-art and art-as-an-essential-public-good are fewer and fewer, it is Apple&#39;s not just opportunity but <em>obligation</em> to step up to the plate.</p><p> I&#39;ve long thought that one of the minor tragedies of Steve Jobs&#39;s second act is that the timing just didn&#39;t work out to sell Pixar to Apple, instead of to Disney. But make no mistake, a love and appreciation for great cinema is not outside Apple&#39;s DNA. No streamer has a higher hit rate for quality shows. Their movies mostly stink so far, but maybe that&#39;s just the learning curve. <em>The Gorge</em> , for example, feels like an Apple TV movie because it&#39;s so decidedly meh. Not horrible, but not good in any way beyond its intriguing elevator-pitch concept. <em>Wolfs</em> was better but still a grand disappointment given its pedigree. But when it comes to shows, no one is doing better. <em>Severance</em> deserves all its acclaim and attention, and Ben Stiller delivered a season 2 finale that&#39;s arguably the best 78 minutes of filmmaking I&#39;ve seen this decade. And <em>The Studio</em> , to me, <em>feels</em> like an Apple TV show — not because of how it looks, what it&#39;s about, or who&#39;s in it, but simply because it&#39;s so good. Netflix almost never makes shows like this. Neither does HBO now that&#39;s its been subsumed by “Max”. Peacock et al don&#39;t even try. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-30"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-30">1</a></sup></p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-30"><p> One more A+ recommendation: <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/219971-the-agency">The Agency</a></em> on Paramount+. Michael Fassbender, Jeffrey Wright, Richard Gere, a breakout searing performance by Jodie Turner-Smith, and a great supporting cast in a super-smart, hyper-realistic-feeling spy-thriller/mystery/love story. Gorgeous cinematography too. Just so good in a “feels like it should have been on Apple TV+” way, sort of like how it was so obvious right from S1.E1 that HBO fucked up big-time by passing on <em>Mad Men</em> . <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-30"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;The Studio&#39; Is Fantastic So Far</title></entry><entry><title> MacOS 15 Sequoia&#39;s Annoying-as-Hell &#39;Turn On Reactions&#39; Menu Bar Prompt </title><link href="https://birchtree.me/blog/this-alert-must-die/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/birchler-sequoia-turn-on-reactions" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41758</id><published> 2025-03-30T18:20:51Z</published><updated> 2025-03-30T18:20:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>“Flagging” isn&#39;t what I was writing about yesterday, with regard to Daring Fireball&#39;s unexplained ghosting at Hacker News in recent years. If you look at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the list of recent DF articles at HN</a> , <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489058">only one is explicitly “flagged”</a> . Whoops, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43491009">now it&#39;s two</a> , but they&#39;re both the same article.</p><p> <a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/114232163652473173">Tim Bray</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I&#39;m really glad <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber">@gruber</a> posted this, because me too. Same timeframe, same behavior.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@reichenstein/114233318059789911">Oliver Reichenstein</a> (from <a href="https://ia.net/">iA</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Same for content from iA. Again and again our posts get to the top page and then someone ghosts them. Ghosting started around the same time as DF ghosting, I think. My take: It looks like someone that has enough access just doesn&#39;t like us. ¯\(ツ)/¯</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve heard privately from a few other bloggers that they&#39;ve seen similar ghosting at HN in recent years.</p><p> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">Near the top of Hackers News&#39;s FAQ</a> :</p><blockquote><p> <em>How are stories ranked?</em></p><p> The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story was submitted. Comments in threads are ranked the same way.</p><p> Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account or site weighting, and moderator action.</p></blockquote><p> Hacker News presents itself as a forum that is primarily driven by the community, where ranking and moderation are mostly, perhaps even overwhelmingly, transparent. And that “moderator action” is only a secondary or even tertiary factor. The core HN audience buys into this — the HN audience is comprised of people who view themselves as independent thinkers.

This moderation cabal operates more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/posts?id=dang">or less</a> in secret.

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">the iPhone X was announced alongside the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus</a> in mid-September. The iPhones 8 shipped that month, and I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">a review of the iPhones 8</a> on September 19. The iPhone X, though, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">wasn&#39;t available to order until October 27</a> , and didn&#39;t start shipping to customers until November 3. It was an unusual iPhone release cycle that year, to say the least. Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I&#39;d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo dropped, so I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">some initial impressions then</a> , but wound up not publishing my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">full review of the iPhone X</a> until December 26.</p><p> A few days later I wrote a follow-up regarding a specific new interaction design, “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">Pressing the Side Button to Confirm Payments on iPhone X</a> ”, which I began thus:</p><blockquote><p> Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from Hacker News. It&#39;s always short-lived, because for reasons I&#39;ve never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles always get blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It&#39;s apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it&#39;s a shame the articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who don&#39;t like Daring Fireball.</p><p> Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage, though, the comment threads still exist. I went through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">the Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review</a> today, and a few comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my attention.</p></blockquote><p> What I didn&#39;t mention then was that DF&#39;s buried status at HN was, at the time, a relatively new phenomenon. Hacker News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">started in early 2007</a> and for a yearslong stretch, Daring Fireball articles seemed more or less appropriately popular there. Articles that I would think would resonate with the HN readership would hit, and get what always seemed to me an appropriate number of comments. At some point in the mid-2010s though, it seemed like DF articles would get downvoted or flagged after hitting the HN front page. I&#39;d been noticing this for some time when I wrote the above in December 2017.</p><p> But even in 2017, DF articles would get active comment threads on HN occasionally. The Hacker News thread I referenced above, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">regarding my iPhone X review</a> , garnered 107 comments. In the years after that, DF articles went from being mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> hitting the HN front page (and gaining some comment traction) to pretty much <em>never</em> hitting the HN front page (and thus never gaining any comment traction). I found this curious, and I couldn&#39;t figure out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">why or how</a> this was happening — or who was doing it — but I didn&#39;t mention it much.</p><p> Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">I did mention it again in a footnote</a> , in a piece about the inexplicably poor state of Android apps from a design perspective:</p><blockquote><p> It sounds a bit conspiratorial, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">for several years now</a> it&#39;s seemed clear to me that Hacker News has Daring Fireball in some sort of graylist. It&#39;s not blacklisted, obviously, given the aforementioned <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">two</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">threads</a> about yesterday&#39;s piece, but nothing I write here ever gains any significant traction there.曾经。 And the reason there are two threads for yesterday&#39;s piece is that the first one disappeared from the home page soon after it was posted.我认为？ In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">this list of recent Hacker News threads for articles from DF</a> , going back four months, only three have more than 10 comments — and two of those are the threads from yesterday. I don&#39;t know who I pissed off there or why, but I&#39;ve never seen an explanation for this. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN commenter Michiel de Mare has quantified the apparent suppression</a> , based on the ranking of this very article. Exactly what I&#39;ve noticed for years.</p></blockquote><p> You can see this yourself right now, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the current list of recent DF articles submitted to Hacker News</a> . Most of them have 0, 1, or 2 comments. Some got up to 3. “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a> ” is the most read, most commented upon thing I&#39;ve written in a while. On Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">it got just 28 comments</a> before being shitlisted, which, I have to say, is just weird. That&#39;s one piece I&#39;d have thought would resonate with the HN audience, and make for good grist for discussion. Then, after the original thread was shitlisted, someone re-submitted it (perhaps confused that it wasn&#39;t on the HN front page). That re-submission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">got 1 comment</a> before it too fell to the mysterious shitlist reaper.</p><p> The one recent exception is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">Why Can&#39;t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</a> ”, which somehow <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">escaped the shitlist and garnered 208 comments</a> . These occasional exceptions to DF&#39;s general shitlisting at HN have always made the whole thing more mysterious to me. There&#39;s clearly no programmatic blacklisting that keeps Daring Fireball articles from being submitted, or from gaining a few comments. But once any traction occurs, <em>something</em> happens and poof, they&#39;re gone from the Hacker News front page. It certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense to me why my off-hand post griping about our inability to screenshot DRM video frames would be an order of magnitude more popular than “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino” was.</p><p> Today, though, I saw <a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">a helpful mention on Mastodon</a> that pointed me to an interesting project. An author named Michael Lynch has written a tool to quantify “ <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">the highest-ranking personal blogs of Hacker News</a> ” since HN&#39;s inception in 2007. According to Lynch&#39;s all-time listing, Daring Fireball ranks #5, which I have to say surprised me, given its years of inexplicable (or at the very least, unexplained) shitlisting status. But Lynch&#39;s tool lets you select date ranges. If you look at <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 through 2021</a> , Daring Fireball ranked #3, behind only <a href="https://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham&#39;s renowned eponymous blog</a> and Brian Krebs&#39;s excellent (and also eponymous) <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</a> . From <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 though 2013</a> , DF ranked #2, behind only Graham (who created Hacker News). But if you look at the last four years, from <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021 through 2025</a> , Daring Fireball ranks #72.</p><p> Maybe I&#39;ve lost my fastball, and I just don&#39;t write so good no more. Or maybe it&#39;s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup> But it seems to me <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">there&#39;s something fishy going on</a> . What bothers me isn&#39;t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgruber">still do</a> when one slips through the cracks. What bothers me is that it&#39;s unexplained.

<p>Oliver Darcy, writing at Status (paywalled — great content, terrible CMS experience that keeps logging me out on all my devices and requires a stupid email magic link to get back in), in a brief interview with Atlantic editor-in-chief and man of the moment Jeffrey Goldberg:</p><blockquote><p> It goes without saying that there are many ironies associated with this particular story. One of them is that Goldberg, a journalist who Donald Trump loathes for his past reporting (remember the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/">“suckers and losers” piece</a> ), somehow became the unintended recipient of high-level, real-time military intelligence from inside his own inner circle. One wonders whether any heads will roll as a result of the whole matter. On Monday, Trump again made his disdain for Goldberg known, blasting him at a press conference and absurdly claiming The Atlantic is “a magazine that is going out of business.”</p><p> If anything, of course, publishing a story like the one Goldberg did on Monday proves how strong the outlet currently is. That type of muscular journalism requires skill, strong leadership, and the backing of a courageous publisher. I asked Goldberg about owner Laurene Powell Jobs&#39; role in the matter. He declined to comment specifically on this particular story, but offered words of praise: “Laurene Powell Jobs is a stalwart and brave publisher at a time when cowardice rules the day.”</p></blockquote><p> If it had been a Washington Post reporter who was inadvertently included on the Trump national security team&#39;s Signal group chat, would they have run the story?

<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s next-generation CarPlay experience is still nowhere to be seen following <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-communication-management-change-of-the-model-year-38985.html">Porsche&#39;s announcement</a> of a major upgrade of its infotainment system for 2026.</p><p> The upcoming 2026 model year Porsche Taycan, 911, Panamera, and Cayenne feature an upgraded version of the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, making it more responsive, adding Dolby Atmos support, and integrating Amazon&#39;s Alexa voice assistant. The new system brings the Porsche App Center, a kind of app store for the vehicle, to all of the new models.</p><p> It continues to support the standard version of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Support for Apple&#39;s next-generation CarPlay experience is again conspicuously missing from Porsche&#39;s new lineup, and the automaker did not mention it at all during its latest announcement — another bleak sign for the delayed feature.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;d crack a joke about it looking less and less likely that next-gen CarPlay was going to appear in 2024, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/apple-carplay-2024">I already did that in January</a> , when Apple itself took the date off <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">its CarPlay page</a> . That announcement <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-carplay-could-revolutionize-your-cars-interface-in-2023">came at WWDC 2022</a> .</p><p> In this case (unlike the advanced personalized features of Apple Intelligence) it was actually sensible for Apple to pre-announce the existence of next-gen CarPlay, given the reliance on third parties. But it also should have been clear just how incredibly hard it would be to get third party carmakers up to snuff on being able to ship it, so Apple giving a date, any date, was always odd. Apple doesn&#39;t make a car, and you can&#39;t promise what you can&#39;t control. They should have just said “soon”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘2026 Porsches Still Won’t Have Next-Gen CarPlay, Which Was Announced in 2022’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/26/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/bluesky_being_right_points" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w7h" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41741</id><published> 2025-03-25T16:53:36Z</published><updated> 2025-03-25T18:17:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Bluesky is what Twitter of yore aspired to be. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Yours truly back in May 2023, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110314382066961654">in a thread on Mastodon</a> (at the time, you needed an invitation code to get into Bluesky, and it was just a few months after Musk&#39;s takeover and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">remaking of what was once Twitter</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Bluesky is going to skyrocket to mainstream popularity and actually replace Twitter, and Mastodon cannot, because Bluesky is being designed to be simple, fun, and — most importantly — easy to understand.</p><p> I&#39;m not trying to provoke. I like Mastodon, especially using <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> , and I love the community I&#39;m in here. And maybe our community will stay here. What makes Mastodon good for us nerds is that all the non-nerds aren&#39;t here.</p><p> But it&#39;s obvious already: regular people instantly grok Bluesky. They&#39;ve had months to sign up for Mastodon and haven&#39;t — because they don&#39;t understand it, and what they see of it doesn&#39;t look like fun.</p><p> As soon as they see Bluesky they start trying to score an invite code.</p><p> Bluesky, in both word (stated intentions) and deed (the nascent service as it stands today), aspires to be a better Twitter. An idealized Twitter, perhaps. It even looks just like Twitter — without all the crap.</p><p> Mastodon was created by and for people who wanted something different from Twitter. So when Twitter refugees show up, it doesn&#39;t feel familiar. Because it&#39;s not supposed to. [...] Hundreds of millions of people liked what Twitter once was, and what it aspired to be. Bluesky might be that.</p></blockquote><p> As recently as last September, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/brazil-x-bluesky">that prediction wasn&#39;t looking so good</a> . But Bluesky finally got some traction around (and especially after) the election, and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bluesky+has+the+juice">juice</a> it picked up wasn&#39;t fleeting.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a diss on Mastodon. If I could only use one of these platforms, Mastodon would be it. By far the highest signal-to-noise ratio amongst my timelines, and by far the best engagement with my readers and listeners. It&#39;s a nerdy platform for nerdy users, but with its commitment to true openness, including APIs, it&#39;s also the platform with by far the best <em>and most varied</em> client apps.</p><p> In the old world, there was one Twitter-like network that mattered: Twitter itself. In the new world, there exists a diaspora of refugees across these Twitter-like platforms, which have each carved out their own vibes. There are pros and cons to the old world and new. I found it much easier, mentally, to have just one place to check, and that place was available through <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">truly excellent native apps</a> for both Mac and iOS. Now that my attention is spread across multiple such networks — (in order of attention) Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, and, last and definitely least, but still there, X — I feel more scattered mentally, but I&#39;m also pretty sure I spend less time overall using all of them combined today than I did for Twitter&#39;s peak decade-or-so, and that I&#39;m better off for that.</p><p> It helps, too, that the first-party apps for Bluesky and Threads are mediocre on iOS (and Threads, oddly, is quite slow everywhere) and can only be used via the web on the Mac — they don&#39;t even have bad Mac client apps, they have <em>no</em> Mac client apps. <em>Helps</em> that is, insofar as I therefore spend less time using them. I&#39;m greatly looking forward to Tapbots&#39;s upcoming Bluesky client, <a href="https://tapbots.com/phoenix/">Phoenix</a> , but in the back of my mind I&#39;m vaguely worried that Phoenix might ultimately make me less productive because the additional joy and efficiency it will add to my Bluesky experience will lead me to spend more time there than I should. A good problem to have.</p><p> What I didn&#39;t see coming in May 2023 was Meta&#39;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/threads">successful launch of Threads that summer</a> . The core problem with Threads is that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a true vision behind it, other than serving to fuck with Elon Musk and X. It&#39;s always been kind of interesting and kind of fun, and has never been toxic. (Meta&#39;s much-ballyhooed “ <em>there&#39;s a new sheriff in town and we aim to please him</em> ” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag">content-moderation policy changes in January</a> have seemingly had no effect whatsoever on the tenor or activity on Threads.) But it&#39;s never been <em>really</em> interesting or <em>really</em> fun. It&#39;s a platform without a soul. It aspires to be anodyne, which is very different than empowering users not to feel like they&#39;ve got to dodge a never-ending barrage of turds being thrown by the angry chaos monkeys who&#39;ve overrun X. If Threads does have a vibe, that vibe is blandness.</p><p> But so while Threads bursting onto the scene in summer 2023 maybe delayed Bluesky&#39;s blossoming, I suspect Threads might have ultimately <em>helped</em> Bluesky by opening the minds of many Twitter refugees into just <em>trying</em> some new alternatives. One size doesn&#39;t fit all. Nor one social network.</p><p> The bottom line is that I think my May 2023 prediction is proving out. Bluesky is what Twitter of yore aspired to be. Users are in control of what they see in their timelines. Sub-communities are vibrant. Shitbirds get blocked and added to blocklists, not elevated to the top of reply threads because they paid for a blue-check power-up. The centralized nature of the Bluesky platform gives the hardcore federation zealots the heebie-jeebies, but that&#39;s what makes Bluesky understandable and approachable, and I think clearly more performant than Mastodon can ever hope to be. It&#39;s a really cool concept for a Twitter-like platform that, after a slow build-up, has turned into an actual really cool platform, whose focus, first and foremost, is putting users first.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ It Might Be Time for Me to Collect Some Being Right Points for My 2023 Bluesky Prediction </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/keyboard_maestro_hack_of_the_week_dont_paste_images" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w74" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41728</id><published> 2025-03-21T19:37:49Z</published><updated> 2025-03-22T16:31:39Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> I keep meaning to write more about Keyboard Maestro, and so I&#39;m just going to start documenting all the little use cases I find for it.

Here&#39;s one from today.</p><p> I use <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> to publish at least 99 percent of the posts on this site. (The other 1 percent are posts I create on my phone, using the web interface for Movable Type.) I use MarsEdit <em>a lot</em> . About once a week or so, I accidentally try to paste text in MarsEdit when I think I have text on my clipboard, but it&#39;s actually an image. When you paste an image in MarsEdit, it&#39;s not like pasting into Mail or Notes or TextEdit, where the image just goes into the text. So MarsEdit, trying to be helpful, opens its <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/marsedit-upload-utility.png">Upload Utility window</a> — which, if I were using WordPress or some other CMS, might allow me to upload the image to my server for referencing from the HTML of the blog post. That&#39;s not how my system works, and not how I want it to work, so every time this happens I have to close the Upload Utility window. And every time, I try to do this by hitting the Esc key on my keyboard. But the Upload Utility window isn&#39;t a dialog box with a Cancel button that would be triggered by Esc. It&#39;s a regular window. So after hitting the Esc key, which doesn&#39;t do anything in this context, I then remember, once again, that I need to hit ⌘W instead. (I think I don&#39;t naturally think to hit ⌘W because my instincts tell me ⌘W would try to close the blog window I&#39;m writing in.)</p><p> Today it happened again, and finally the notion occurred to me that I could fix this with Keyboard Maestro. My first thought was that I could create a macro that <em>would</em> close the frontmost window in MarsEdit if, and only if, the frontmost window was named “Upload Utility”. A second later it occurred to me that I could probably do better than that, and prevent the Upload Utility window from opening in the first place if I ever try to paste an image in MarsEdit.</p><p> I was right. This wasn&#39;t just super easy to create in Keyboard Maestro, it was super quick. I&#39;ve spent 10× more time writing about this macro here than I did creating it. I think that&#39;s why I so seldom write about my little hacks in Keyboard Maestro — they not only save me time and eliminate annoyances once they&#39;re created, but they&#39;re so easy to create that I just get back to whatever I was previously doing after making a new one.</p><p> First, I have a group (think: folders) in Keyboard Maestro for every app for which I&#39;ve created app-specific macros. You just create a new group and set it to only be available when one (or more) specific applications are active. Inside my group for MarsEdit, I created a new macro named “Don&#39;t Paste Images”.</p><p> It&#39;s triggered by the hot key sequence ⌘V. That means every single time I paste in MarsEdit, this macro will run. Keyboard Maestro is so frigging fast that I&#39;ll never notice. (Keyboard Maestro macros execute so fast that in some scenarios, you have to add steps to pause for, say, 0.2 seconds to keep the macro from getting ahead of the user interface it&#39;s manipulating.)</p><p> The macro executes a simple <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/If_Then_Else">if-then-else action</a> with the following pseudocode logic:</p><pre> <code>if the System Clipboard has an image play a sound else simulate the keystroke ⌘V</code></pre><p> That&#39;s the whole thing. And it worked perfectly the first time I tried it. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/km-dont-paste-images-marsedit.png">Here&#39;s a screenshot of my macro</a> .</p><p> So if <em>I</em> type ⌘V in MarsEdit, and the clipboard contains an image, I just hear a beep. (I could just default to the system beep, but I chose the standard MacOS “Bottle” sound just for this macro — I sort of want to know that it&#39;s <em>this</em> macro keeping me from pasting whatever text I wrongly thought was on my clipboard, so I want a distinctive sound to play.) Nothing gets pasted, so MarsEdit&#39;s Upload Utility window doesn&#39;t appear.</p><p> If the clipboard <em>doesn&#39;t</em> contain an image, then Keyboard Maestro simulates a ⌘V shortcut and that gets passed to MarsEdit, and from my perspective as a user, it&#39;s just like a normal paste of the text I expected. I have a few macros that work like this, where the macro is trigged by an application&#39;s own keyboard shortcut, and the macro will (if certain conditions are met) pass through the same simulated keyboard shortcut to the application. When I first tried this, many years ago, I was half worried that it would trigger an infinite loop, where the simulated keystroke from the Keyboard Maestro macro would re-trigger the macro. I was wrong to worry — Keyboard Maestro is too clever for that.</p><p> You almost certainly don&#39;t have my particular problem with the occasional inadvertent pasting of images into MarsEdit. But I bet you have your own esoteric annoyances related to your own most-used apps and most-frequent tasks. Keyboard Maestro lets you effectively add your own little features to your favorite apps — often with no “scripting” at all. The best part is, while writing this very blog post, my new “Don&#39;t Paste Images” macro saved me from seeing that cursed Upload Utility window once more, because I had the screenshot of the macro on my clipboard, when I thought I had copied the URL for it on my server.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Keyboard Maestro Hack of the Week: Don&#39;t Paste Images</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
