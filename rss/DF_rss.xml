<p>周二，郭明池发表了一篇题为《 <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/the-iphone-15-pro-series-overheating-issues-are-unrelated-to-tsmcs-advanced-3nm-node-iphone-15-5f354b1ab155">iPhone 15 Pro 系列过热问题与台积电先进 3nm 节点无关</a>》的短文：</p><blockquote><p>我的调查表明，iPhone 15 Pro系列过热问题与台积电先进的3nm节点无关。主要原因更可能是在热系统设计中为了实现更轻的重量而做出的妥协，例如减少散热面积和使用钛框架，这对热效率产生了负面影响。预计苹果将通过软件更新解决这个问题，但除非苹果降低处理器性能，否则改进可能会受到限制。如果苹果不能妥善解决这一问题，可能会对 iPhone 15 Pro 系列整个产品生命周期的出货量产生负面影响。</p></blockquote><p>这就是整个帖子。该帖子明确暗示，iPhone 15 Pro 机型存在与钛金属边框相关的设计缺陷，导致过热，并且由于该缺陷与硬件设计有关，苹果将被迫限制 CPU 和 GPU，从而影响 iPhone 15 Pro 的销量。 15 Pro 型号将受到影响。</p><p>郭的影响力很大，因此他的报告<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=aapl+price+sept+25+to+29+2023">导致苹果股价大幅下跌</a>。郭的影响力不是源于他的直觉，而是源于他的消息来源，但这就是像这样的指控的问题所在。郭的叙述引起了足够的关注，苹果公司发表了一份声明，全文如下：</p><blockquote><p>我们已经确定了一些可能导致 iPhone 运行温度高于预期的情况。在设置或恢复设备后的最初几天，由于后台活动增加，设备可能会感觉更热。我们还在 iOS 17 中发现了一个影响部分用户的错误，并将在软件更新中解决。另一个问题涉及最近对第三方应用程序的一些更新，这些更新导致它们使系统过载。我们正在与这些应用程序开发人员合作修复正在推出的过程中。</p></blockquote><p>不仅 iPhone 15 Pro 机型的钛金属框架在散热方面<em>不是</em>问题，而且苹果告诉我——而且我没有理由怀疑——iPhone 15 Pro 和 Pro Max 的散热效果比之前的任何 iPhone 都要<em>好</em>使用不锈钢框架（iPhone X、XS 和 11-14 Pro）。钛金属框架的散热绝对没有任何问题，而且实际上有很多好处，而且苹果没有计划以任何方式限制 A17 的性能。 iOS 17 中只有一些 bug 需要修复，仅此而已。</p><p>长期以来，iPhone 在设置（或完全恢复）后的最初几天有时会变热：各种大型库（如照片）会在后台同步，并且会进行各种设备上处理。每年秋季主要新 iOS 版本的第一个版本中也经常会出现与性能相关的错误，根据苹果的声明，今年也不例外。</p><p>至于有问题的第三方应用程序，Instagram 就是其中之一，该应用程序显然在本周刚刚发布了一个版本，修复了一个错误，该错误非常严重，以至于 iPhone 的电池寿命会以 1%/分钟的速度消耗殆尽。闲置的。 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6X2ZIkYFsQ">YouTube 用户 Faruk “iPhonedo” Korkmaz 本周发布了一段视频，</a>展示了 Instagram 的 bug 版本将两台不同的 iPhone 加热到 100°F：一台是 iPhone 15 Pro，另一台是一年前的 iPhone 14 Pro。完全相同的过热问题。 （我在这里质疑为什么 iOS 允许任何应用程序消耗如此多的资源，以至于设备太热而无法舒适地握住，但这个错误显然是 Instagram 的<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">。Uber 也是如此</a>。真正令人震惊的是，这两个应用程序是用科学怪人式的网络和互联网大杂烩制作的。原生 UI 工具包会在资源方面疯狂运行。）</p><p>郭明池显然在苹果亚洲供应链中拥有一些出色的资源。但他有时还是犯了<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">很大的错误</a>。而且，与马克·古尔曼不同的是，郭的消息来源似乎从来都不是来自苹果内部。他关于这个过热问题的帖子几乎明显是台积电的泄密——有点“<em>无论 iPhone 15 Pro 散热发生什么，都与我们的 3nm 工艺无关</em>”。将其归咎于新的钛合金框架只是郭的疯狂猜测，而且从所有证据来看，这是<em>完全错误的</em>。</p><p>如果郭对准确性或真实性有任何尊重，正如我确信他所做的那样，他将完全撤回。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ iPhone 15 OverheatGate 似乎没什么大不了的</title></entry><entry><title>脱口秀：“二号门” </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/09/30/ep-386" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v2f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/01/the-talk-show-386" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40263</id><published> 2023-10-01T16:15:31Z</published><updated> 2023-10-01T16:15:32Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Aaron Tilley 和 Yang Jie 为《华尔街日报》进行报道，标题并非标题党的标题“<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-modem-chip-failure-6fe33d19">苹果为其新 iPhone 制造关键部件的惨败内幕</a>”（ <a href="https://apple.news/AWKJlHS4MSQW1QmNj7lMUeA">News+ 链接</a>）：</p><blockquote><p>上周推出的新 iPhone 机型缺少苹果公司花费数年时间和数十亿美元试图及时开发的专有硅芯片。 2018 年，苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克 (Tim Cook) 下令设计和制造调制解调器芯片（将 iPhone 与无线运营商连接的部件），导致雇用了数千名工程师。其目标是切断苹果公司对高通公司的勉强依赖，高通公司是一家长期主导调制解调器市场的芯片供应商。</p></blockquote><p>上述领导正确地奠定了基础，如果有什么不同的话，那就是低估了苹果和高通之间的竞争。高通确实在调制解调器芯片市场占据主导地位，但这甚至可能说得太温和了——它们实际上是优质 5G 蜂窝调制解调器芯片的唯一竞争者。苹果公司在蜂窝调制解调器方面对高通的依赖不仅仅是令人嫉妒的，更是令人鄙视的。即使苹果和高通相处融洽，苹果<a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/">也会面临核心技术依赖单一公司的问题</a>。但苹果和高通根本相处不来。</p><p>但上述故事之后的一切充其量都是可疑的，而且在某些方面，这是一个荒谬且相当透明的热门作品。听起来像是高通公司给蒂利和杰提供的，尽管存在明显的问题，但他们还是买下了它。</p><blockquote><p>苹果公司原计划将其调制解调器芯片准备在新的 iPhone 机型中使用。但去年年底的测试发现该芯片速度太慢并且容易过热。它的电路板太大了，足有半个iPhone，无法使用。</p></blockquote><p>这根本没有任何意义。这是一个不可能的场景。这听起来像是 Twitter/X 上匿名巨魔的言论，而不是《华尔街日报》的报道。但这<em>是</em>《华尔街日报》报道的，让我们想想这一段话有多么可笑。</p><p>首先，时间线并没有加起来。我们不仅应该相信苹果“去年年底”只是在测试 iPhone 15 调制解调器芯片的可行性，而且该芯片“太大了，会占据半部 iPhone，使其无法使用” 。诚然，“占据半部iPhone”的调制解调器芯片将无法使用，但为什么会<em>考虑</em>在今年的手机中使用这样的芯片呢？它可能是世界上功能最好的 5G 调制解调器——性能更快<em>、</em>效率更高——但如果这么大，它根本无法使用。还差得很远。看看<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">iPhone 14 的拆解</a>，就知道高通的 X65 调制解调器芯片组有多小。</p><p>当然有可能“去年年底”苹果测试了苹果设计的蜂窝调制解调器的<em>原型</em>，该原型很大，性能缓慢，而且运行温度太高。这就是组件开发的工作原理：在早期的大型原型中，功能性是第一位的，其次是小型化。您不必是一名系统工程师也能明白这其中的道理。为什么要浪费时间来对一个尚不清楚工作性能的组件进行小型化呢？ <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-21"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-21">1</a></sup></p><p>但他们不可能在<em>今年的</em>iPhone 上测试这样的东西。硬件的交付时间是<em>几年</em>而不是几个月。而且由于苹果每年需要生产数亿部新 iPhone，因此 iPhone 硬件设计的交付时间比大多数产品更长，而不是更短。苹果今天不仅知道明年的 iPhone 16 型号中将使用蜂窝调制解调器，而且他们可能已经决定了两年后的 iPhone 17 的调制解调器以及几乎所有其他东西。</p><blockquote><p>苹果尚未公开承认其调制解调器项目，更不用说其缺点了，据估计，苹果去年已向高通支付了超过 72 亿美元的芯片费用。</p></blockquote><p> Apple 2019 年新闻稿：“ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">Apple 将收购英特尔智能手机调制解调器业务的大部分</a>。”我不知道他们如何能比这更清楚地认可这个项目。</p><p>回到日记：</p><blockquote><p>这些人士表示，由于技术挑战、沟通不畅以及经理们对于尝试设计芯片而不是购买芯片是否明智的问题存在分歧，苹果调制解调器芯片的工程团队工作进展缓慢。美国和国外的团队被孤立在不同的小组中，没有全球领导者。一些经理不鼓励工程师传播有关延误或挫折的坏消息，从而导致不切实际的目标和拖延的最后期限。</p></blockquote><p>从这里开始，《华尔街日报》的故事开始有点像高通编造的故事。我们不知道高通是幕后黑手，但我们确实知道，高通<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g">在 iPhone 发布会前一天</a>发布了一份有关两家公司之间续签协议的新闻稿，给苹果的调制解调器努力蒙上了阴影。在 iPhone 15 上市前一天，有一个新故事描绘了苹果调制解调器团队内部技术无能和管理混乱的情况，还有什么比这更好的跟进方式呢？如果高通担心自己的工程人才流失，这种说法尤其适合高通。</p><blockquote><p> “仅仅因为苹果生产了地球上最好的芯片，就认为他们也可以生产调制解调器，这是荒谬的，”前苹果无线主管 Jaydeep Ranade 说，他于 2018 年（该项目开始的那一年）离开了公司。</p></blockquote><p> 《华尔街日报》的第一个消息来源是一位<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaydeepranade/">前苹果员工</a>，他承认在开始自己的调制解调器项目之前就离开了公司，他敏锐的洞察力是，一家擅长某件事的公司可能不擅长完全不同的事情。</p><blockquote><p>知情人士称，预计苹果要到 2025 年末才会生产类似的芯片。这些人士表示，可能还会有进一步的延误，但该公司相信最终会成功。</p></blockquote><p>如果苹果预计要到“2025 年末”才能生产出与高通相当的 5G 调制解调器芯片，那么他们为什么要在 2022 年测试一款芯片，希望将其应用到今天的 iPhone 15 中呢？一个还不到四年的项目突然比计划晚了四年？这个故事本身就反驳了自己。</p><blockquote><p>苹果公司发现，相比之下，设计微处理器（本质上是一台运行软件的微型计算机）很容易。传输和接收无线数据的调制解调器芯片必须符合严格的连接标准，才能为世界各地的无线运营商提供服务。</p><p> “这些延误表明苹果没有预料到这项工作的复杂性，”长期担任高通前高管的塞尔吉·维伦格 (Serge Willenegger) 表示，他于 2018 年离开公司，并不了解苹果芯片的当前状况。 “蜂窝网络是一个怪物。”</p></blockquote><p>第二位消息人士是<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serge-willenegger-bb06961/">一位退休高管，他的整个职业生涯都在高通度过</a>，他敏锐的洞察力强调，高通作为无可争议的行业领导者的领域非常困难。</p><blockquote><p>苹果公司在十多年前就致力于生产更多用于其产品的各种半导体。 2010年，该公司开始在iPhone和iPad中使用自己的处理芯片。这些芯片帮助苹果超越了许多 Android 竞争对手，后者依赖高通、台湾联发科和其他制造商的芯片。</p></blockquote><p>苹果芯片的性能优于“许多安卓竞争对手”？请分享它没有表现出色的那些。但那些 A 系列芯片很“简单”。</p><blockquote><p>该公司于 2020 年开始用专有芯片替换 Mac 电脑中使用多年的英特尔处理器芯片，该芯片使其笔记本电脑运行速度更快，产生的热量更少，这些改进有助于<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chips-that-rebooted-the-mac-11650081649?mod=article_inline">提振萎靡不振的 Mac 销量</a>。 Apple 芯片还为公司在每台电脑上节省了约 75 至 150 美元。</p></blockquote><p>苹果广受好评的 M 系列芯片无疑有助于 Mac 的销售，但说 Mac 的销售“落后”于英特尔的说法是错误的。事实上，Apple 芯片型号首次亮相<em>之前</em>的最后一个季度（即 2020 年第三季度）的 Mac 销量在当时<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/29/aapl-q4-2020">是 Mac 有史以来最好的销售季度</a>。尽管苹果公司已于当年 6 月在 WWDC 上宣布了芯片转型。在更换<em>之前，</em> Mac 就打破了历史销售记录。</p><blockquote><p>苹果公司将其调制解调器芯片项目命名为“Sinope”，以希腊神话中智胜宙斯的仙女命名。苹果前人力资源主管兼 BraveCore 咨询公司联合创始人克里斯·迪弗 (Chris Deaver) 表示，在库克、斯鲁吉和其他人指示苹果打造自己的无线组件后，该计划于 2018 年开始成形。</p></blockquote><p>迪弗是《华尔街日报》报道中第三位点名的消息人士，<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-deaver/details/experience/">他于 2015 年至 2019 年在苹果公司从事人力资源工作</a>，并与人合着了一本<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Together-Design-Creativity-Co-Creation/dp/1265386676/?tag=df-amzn-20">即将出版的书，其预购描述如下</a>：“来自帮助蒂姆·库克将苹果从‘思考’转型的思想领袖。 “不同的”到“一起以不同的方式工作”——这是一本及时的指南，可以帮助领导者变得更有创造力，并帮助有创造力的人成为更好的领导者”。您永远猜不到书封套的调色板。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-21"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-21">2</a></sup></p><blockquote><p> 2019 年 12 月，Srouji 飞往慕尼黑迎接苹果新收购的英特尔无线员工。据观看会议的人士称，他在一次聚会上表示，调制解调器芯片项目将改变苹果的游戏规则，是公司发展的下一步。他表示，该芯片将使苹果设备与众不同，就像苹果处理器所做的那样。</p><p>随着苹果公司用英特尔工程师和从高通聘请的其他人员填补了该项目的空缺，公司高管设定了一个目标，即在 2023 年秋季准备好调制解调器芯片。该项目的许多无线专家很快就意识到，实现这一目标是不可能的。</p></blockquote><p>因此，苹果希望自己的蜂窝调制解调器能够适用于今年的 iPhone 15，是在 2019 年，而不是“去年年底”。同样，这全部来自同一份《华尔街日报》的报道。</p><blockquote><p>苹果公司发现，采用数千名工程师的蛮力（这一策略在设计智能手机和笔记本电脑的计算机大脑方面取得了成功）并不足以快速生产出卓越的调制解调器芯片。</p></blockquote><p> The implication here is that Apple silicon is designed by the proverbial infinite monkeys typing on infinite typewriters — in complete contradiction of Brooks&#39;s Law.</p><blockquote><p> Modem chips are trickier to make than processing chips because they must work seamlessly with 5G wireless networks, as well as the 2G, 3G and 4G networks used in countries around the world, each with its own technological quirks. Apple microprocessors run software programs designed solely for its iPhones and laptops.</p></blockquote><p> Again and again, this story emphasizes that SoC&#39;s — comprising CPUs, GPUs, neural processing units, and more — are easy, but cellular modems are uniquely difficult. The nonsensical spin in this paragraph is that cellular modems are made difficult by the variety of networks around the world, and Apple&#39;s CPUs are made easier by the fact that they need only execute software “designed solely for its iPhones and laptops”. Let&#39;s leave aside the fact that this clunky phrasing omits form factors like watches, tablets, and desktop computers, and instead consider that Apple silicon is so performant that, via Rosetta 2 translation (technology that I&#39;m sure was also easy to make), the <em>slowest</em> Apple silicon Mac ever made (an M1 MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/15/m1-chip-emulating-x86-benchmark/">runs software compiled for Intel processors faster than any Intel Mac Apple ever shipped</a> . Apple silicon not only doesn&#39;t exclusively run software “designed” for it, it runs software compiled for Intel chips better than Intel&#39;s own chips do.</p><blockquote><p> Apple executives who didn&#39;t have experience with wireless chips set tight timelines that weren&#39;t realistic, former project engineers said. Teams had to build prototype versions of the chips and certify they would work with the many wireless carriers worldwide, a time-consuming job.</p></blockquote><p> The second sentence here implies that Apple&#39;s modem project executives didn&#39;t expect that they&#39;d need to build prototypes or that worldwide carrier certification would be time-consuming — because I&#39;m sure Apple had no difficulty getting the iPhone certified across all supported carriers prior to the start of this project in 2019.</p><blockquote><p> Executives better understood the challenge after Apple tested its prototypes late last year. The results weren&#39;t good, according to people familiar with the tests. The chips were essentially three years behind Qualcomm&#39;s best modem chip. Using them threatened to make iPhone wireless speeds slower than its competitors.</p><p> The company scratched plans to use the chips in Apple&#39;s 2023 models, and the planned rollout was moved to 2024. Eventually, Apple executives realized the company wouldn&#39;t meet that goal either. Apple instead opened negotiations with Qualcomm to continue supplying the modem chips. Apple&#39;s licensing deal with Qualcomm expires in April 2025, though it can be extended for another two years.</p></blockquote><p> I cannot emphasize enough how goofy the idea is that “late last year” Apple was still hoping to use its own cellular modems in this year&#39;s iPhones.</p><p> Here&#39;s what the Journal is declaring a “spectacular failure”: High-end cellular modems are essential components that are very difficult to engineer, and Qualcomm owns the entire market. Apple bought Intel&#39;s second-tier modem business for $1 billion in 2019 and set an ambitious goal of producing its own modems that match or surpass Qualcomm&#39;s by 2023. They missed that best-case-scenario target and thus are still buying modems from Qualcomm and will continue to for at least the next year or two. Not only is this not a “spectacular failure”, not a word of it is news.</p><blockquote><p> Apple has the cash and the desire to keep pursuing its modem chip, according to people involved with the project. “Apple isn&#39;t going to give up,” said Edward Snyder, a managing director of Charter Equity Research and a wireless industry expert. “They hate Qualcomm&#39;s living guts.”</p></blockquote><p> Finally, a named source in this cursed story who said something accurate.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-21"><p> For example, consider this passage from a February report by Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/apple-watch-blood-glucose-monitor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-care-aapl">about Apple&#39;s progress to invent a blood glucose monitor for Apple Watch</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple&#39;s system — more than 12 years in the making — is now considered to be at a proof-of-concept stage, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential. The company believes the technology is viable but needs to be shrunk down to a more practical size.</p><p> Engineers are working to develop a prototype device about the size of an iPhone that can be strapped to a person&#39;s bicep. That would be a significant reduction from an early version of the system that sat atop a table.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s how prototypes work. But no one is proposing, with a straight face, that an iPhone-sized blood glucose monitor might go in next year&#39;s Apple Watch. <a href="#fnr1-2023-09-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-09-21"><p> Deaver announced the book on LinkedIn a month ago, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095517841457631232/">one of the comments on his post reads</a> , “Thank you for the early peek into your book Chris 🙏🏽😊 It&#39;s very insightful 👏🏽👌🏽”.

<p>Michael McWhertor, reporting for Polygon on what I consider the most eye-catching of the revelations from Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/microsofts-xbox-plans-revealed-emails-tied-ftc-case-rcna105766">botched document upload to the FTC</a> :</p><blockquote><p> But Xbox head Phil Spencer said in 2020 — a month before Microsoft announced its plan to acquire ZeniMax and subsidiary Bethesda Softworks — that his No. 1 pick for an acquisition or merger is Nintendo. In emails leaked as part of the Federal Trade Commission&#39;s case to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23500417/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-ftc-lawsuit-acquisition">block the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal in court</a> , Spencer named Nintendo as “THE prime asset for us in Gaming.”</p><p> Spencer discussed the possibility of an acquisition or merger with Nintendo in an email with Microsoft executive Takeshi Numoto. Spencer said that he&#39;d “had numerous conversations with the [leadership team] of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and feel like if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo we are probably in the best position.”</p><p> Two things stood in Microsoft&#39;s way, according to Spencer: “The unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that Nintendo is sitting on a big pile of cash,” and “they have a [board of directors] that until recently has not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation.”</p></blockquote><p> I can&#39;t imagine things going well for Nintendo — a company whose entire existence is based on their unique style, design, and taste — under Microsoft, a company infamous for having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsyOlwmHt5E">no taste</a> .</p><p> And the translation for that last paragraph quoted above is that Nintendo is (a) profitable and (b) run by a board of directors who are interested <em>not</em> in a quick buck, but instead on stewarding the company&#39;s continuing long-term success as a distinct and independent company.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> I either forgot this or never knew it, but <a href="https://youtu.be/yT_i6hXf9WU?si=VA4mVFKYEhl5VgwP&amp;t=339">Microsoft inquired about acquiring Nintendo back around 1999</a> , before committing to designing and building its own hardware for the original Xbox.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Microsoft Xbox Chief Phil Spencer Wanted to Buy Nintendo in 2020’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/21/microsoft-nintendo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Verge: &#39;Apple&#39;s New FineWoven iPhone Cases Are Very Bad&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v20" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/21/verge-finewoven" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40248</id><published> 2023-09-21T22:11:36Z</published><updated> 2023-09-22T02:01:19Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Allison Johnson, The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> If I&#39;m putting one of these cases on my phone, I&#39;m inevitably going to scratch it on accident with a jagged fingernail edge, or it&#39;s going to come into contact with my car keys. And when you scratch FineWoven, the results are seemingly permanent. When we first inspected the cases after picking them up at Apple Park, Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel picked one up and ran his fingernails across it five times — and that was all it took to leave a trail of indelible scuffs on the fabric. The scratches are still there a week later, no matter how many times I&#39;ve tried “buffing” it out by rubbing my finger over it.</p><p> I&#39;m trying to imagine what this case would be like after a year of being subjected to the dust and lint at the bottom of my purse or the stray scratches from nails and keys. God help me if my toddler ever managed to put his grubby hands on it, which he absolutely would. I just don&#39;t see any way that this material ages gracefully. The leather cases had their problems, but when leather gets old, it at least looks nice — a scuffed, dusty fabric case will not.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m curious what real-world usage will look like, but that fingernail test doesn&#39;t seem fair when comparing FineWoven to leather. One fingernail scratched across one of Apple&#39;s leather cases or wallets will leave a permanent mark too. Perhaps it&#39;s the case that such wear looks good on leather but bad on FineWoven.</p><p> Judging from my inbox, third-party leather case makers are <em>very</em> excited about Apple&#39;s decision no longer to use it.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Also worth noting is that Apple&#39;s new <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJD3AM/A/45mm-evergreen-magnetic-link-m-l">FineWoven Magnetic Link Apple Watch bands</a> are not yet available — you can&#39;t even place a pre-order for a new watch that comes paired with one, nor a standalone watch strap.

<p><em>Blah blah blah, something something something</em> about how most people don&#39;t upgrade their phones every year, so we ought not review new ones based on year-over-year comparisons. But, I get a new iPhone every year. A lot of you probably do too. So let&#39;s just lean into a direct comparison between the iPhones 15 Pro and last year&#39;s 14 Pro. After just under a week testing them, with the iPhone 15 Pro Max as my primary, I&#39;ve got four reasons to consider upgrading.</p><h2> Titanium</h2><p> I&#39;m putting this first, even above the camera. Camera improvements are objective. The differences between titanium and the previous material for top-tier iPhones, polished stainless steel, are in many ways subjective. But the reduction in weight and better feel in hand are just so dramatic. Everyone uses their phone in different ways. There are some people out there who never take photographs or shoot video with their phones. But everyone <em>carries</em> and <em>holds</em> their iPhone. Making it a nicer object in hand is a huge win for a handheld tool.</p><p> We shy away from admitting it, at least of late, but gadget lust is real. People are drawn to exquisite objects and premium materials. New cars, new cameras, new watches (or newly-purchased old watches). Phones have been playing this game since long before Apple entered the industry. If you&#39;re old enough, you remember the first time you saw a Motorola Razr. The way they snapped shut. The cool buttons. I remember thinking, <em>Damn that&#39;s cool.</em> And before that era, <a href="https://medium.com/leadership-culture/gordon-gekko-and-the-first-cellphone-on-the-beach-moment-3cb1204becc2">this</a> was cool.</p><p> I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason Apple used stainless steel for six generations — 2017&#39;s iPhone X through last year&#39;s 14 Pros — other than the fact that it looked cool, and looked premium. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/the_iphones_14_pro">As I wrote last year</a> , reviewing the iPhones 14 Pro, “It certainly looks nice that it&#39;s polished to a high gloss, but steel is just so damn heavy.”</p><p> Our long national nightmare of too-heavy iPhones is over.</p><p> Titanium is an upgrade in every way. First, it makes for dramatically lighter devices. I&#39;ve been testing all four new iPhone models, Pro and non-pro alike, and while the Pro models are a few grams heavier than the corresponding non-pro models using aluminum frames, the weight difference in hand is negligible. To compare cameras side-by-side, I&#39;ve been walking around with three phones — the new iPhone 15 Pro Max and regular 15 Pro, and my year-old 14 Pro — and I had to put cases made from distinct materials on the phones to tell them apart in my pocket, because the new 15 Pro Max <em>feels</em> about the weight of last year&#39;s regular-size 14 Pro. It&#39;s <em>not</em> the same weight, but it&#39;s surprisingly close: 221g vs. 206g. The new regular-size 15 Pro weighs just 187g, compared to the aluminum iPhone 15 at 171g. But those numeric weight values don&#39;t do justice to the feel. These new titanium iPhones Pro <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-facts-and-estimates/">just feel strikingly lighter and better-balanced</a> than the stainless steel iPhone Pro models they replace.</p><p> I also strongly prefer the way these new titanium frames both look and feel to the touch. My review unit 15 Pro Max is in natural titanium, and the 15 Pro is blue. Both are <a href="https://www.threads.net/@vjeranp/post/CxbAqeISV26">quite handsome</a> . (And the blue titanium is a close match to the Midnight MacBook Airs.) Polished stainless steel is nice, of course, but it never jibed with my conception of the iPhone as a <em>tool</em> , like a traditional camera. You don&#39;t see high-end cameras made from stainless steel — too heavy, too polished. The finish on the titanium frames of the iPhones 15 Pro is just terrific. It&#39;s elegant, not industrial, but it conveys a certain <em>let&#39;s get to work</em> seriousness. For pure hand feel alone, I&#39;ve preferred the non-pro iPhones in the 11–14 models. Now, I clearly prefer the feel of the 15 Pro models. It&#39;s the best feel of an iPhone in hand since the lovely <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2012/09/iphone_5">iPhone 5</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c">5S</a> , way back when iPhones were little slivers of a thing a decade ago. Looks-wise, the textured titanium is somewhat reminiscent of the brushed stainless steel of the iPhones 4 and 4S.</p><p> The buttons — side, volume, and Action — all have great clickiness and no wiggle. The button edges are crisp but not sharp.</p><p> Even if you, like many people, put your iPhone in a case the day you buy it and never see or feel the titanium again until the day you take it out of the case to trade it in for a new one, you win, because your iPhone 15 Pro will be so much lighter and better balanced. The titanium look and feel is a subjective win for those of us who go caseless most or even just much of the time. But it&#39;s an undeniable win in weight reduction even for the always-cased.</p><p> Apple first used titanium in a product <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/225433/the-powerbook-g4-titanium-still-looks-great-next-to-todays-macbook-air.html">back with the 2001 PowerBook G4</a> , the laptop that defined the basic roundrectilinear shape and metallic finish of Apple&#39;s laptops to this day. That machine still looks remarkably modern for a 22-year-old computer, but it didn&#39;t take long for Apple to abandon titanium for aluminum. Apple&#39;s material science chops weren&#39;t ready for titanium then — those PowerBooks were painted, and the paint flaked over time. I&#39;d argue they aged well, developing a <em>patina</em> , as watch collectors say, but they aged, and aged quickly.</p><p> Apple is fundamentally a computer company, but materials engineering is an essential arm of the company. How many years did we listen to Jony Ive-narrated introductory videos talking about <em>aluminium</em> and <em>unibody</em> construction? We take unibody laptop frames for granted now — they&#39;re just the way almost all high-quality laptops are made across the entire industry — but it was a revolutionary technique at the time of introduction.</p><p> Apple is proud enough of its use of titanium in the iPhones 15 Pro that an entire segment of the keynote last week was presented by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangisabel/">Isabel Yang</a> , a materials science engineer. It&#39;s a significant breakthrough, especially at the scale with which Apple needs to produce all iPhone models, particularly the Pro ones. I&#39;ve long suspected that the Edition models of Apple Watch have been a testing ground for materials they might someday use in high-production-quantity devices. Ceramic made for arguably <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/jony-ive-apple-watch-collector-hodinkee-magazine">the most beautiful watches</a> Apple has ever made, but seemingly didn&#39;t go anywhere — it was never even rumored as a potential material for the iPhone. The titanium Edition watches from Series 5–7, however, strike me as the devices that paved the way for last year&#39;s Apple Watch Ultra and, now, the kings of the Apple lineup, the iPhones Pro.</p><p> It&#39;s a rousing success that makes for the best feel in hand, by far, of the modern (post-X) iPhone era, and is unmatched by any competing phone maker. Top-tier Android phones are made from aluminum, Apple&#39;s mid-tier material. Titanium is better functionally — it&#39;s stronger — and just as importantly, it&#39;s just fucking cool.</p><h2> Cameras</h2><p> There are three major new camera features in the iPhone 15 models this year. <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-19"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-19">1</a></sup> First is a significant upgrade to the main camera (the one that covers the ranges 1×-2× optically). Second, Portrait mode has seen its biggest year-over-year improvement since the feature debuted. Third, and exclusive to the 15 Pro Max, is a new 5× telephoto camera, with a 120mm equivalent field of view. (The regular 15 Pro&#39;s telephoto remains at 3×/77mm; the non-pro iPhones 15 have no telephoto lens.)</p><p> Main camera first. Last year Apple introduced a new 48 megapixel sensor for the 14 Pro main camera. It still produced 12MP images by default, clustering the 48MP sensor into a matrix of “quad pixels”. Each 2×2 square of 4 native pixels on the sensor was used to create 1 pixel of the image. This technique traded detail for extra light sensitivity. You could opt to shoot ProRAW to get 48MP images with the iPhone 14 Pros, but that really is a professional feature. I consider myself a semi-serious prosumer photographer, but when it comes to shooting formats, I shoot very simply — using the built-in Camera app, and the default format (HEIF). I care a lot about my photos, but I really do just point and shoot.</p><p> Last year the iPhone 14 Pro offered four “lenses” from the three back cameras: 0.5×, 1×, 2×, and 3×. 0.5× was the ultra wide hardware camera. 3× was the telephoto. Both the 1× and 2× “lenses” were from the same main camera, though. At 1× the camera system quad-binned the entire 48MP camera sensor; at 2× it used a 12 MP crop from the center of the camera sensor. The result is that for 2× photos, you still got a 12MP image, with far more detail and resolution than you&#39;d get from shooting at 1× and then cropping to the center of the image in post.</p><p> This year with the iPhones 15 Pro, the ultra wide and telephoto situations are similar, except that on the Pro Max the telephoto is 5× instead of 3×. But the “Photonic Engine” image processing pipeline for the main camera on both 15 Pro models is more advanced this year. Here&#39;s how Apple describes it:</p><blockquote><p> The Photonic Engine uses a new 48MP frame in our image pipeline, enabling iPhone to combine the best of low light — 12MP images with large quad pixels — with the best of detail — a 48MP image with individual pixels. This approach is an industry first, and it enables a new default resolution for the Main camera — a 24MP image with more detail, great low-light performance, and all the features users expect from an iPhone camera — Deep Fusion, Smart HDR, Live Photos, and zero shutter lag.</p><p> Take photos at 1× and compare to 12MP photos of other phones — you see more details when you zoom in, especially when looking at hair, skin, or the texture of clothing.</p></blockquote><p> Effectively, this is a next-generation step into computational photography. With quad pixels, you can easily see how the iPhone 14 Pro generated 12MP images from a 48MP sensor. It&#39;s grade school division: 48 ÷ 4 = 12. But there is no 24MP sensor in the 15 Pro main camera. The Photonic Engine takes several images from the sensor for each photo, including a 48MP one for detail, and a 12MP quad-pixel one for low-light and noise reduction, then computationally fuses them together to produce a single 24MP image. Apple is having its cake and eating it too, merging the benefits of a sensor with many small pixels with the benefits of a sensor with fewer large pixels. You don&#39;t need to know that this is happening, you just get more detail in your photos from the main camera.</p><p> I mentioned above that both the 1× and 2× “lenses” on the iPhone 14 Pro use the same physical main camera. With the iPhones 15 Pro, Apple has added additional virtual lenses:</p><ul><li> 1.0× ≈ 24mm</li><li> 1.2× ≈ 28mm</li><li> 1.5× ≈ 35mm</li><li> 2.0× ≈ 48mm</li></ul><p> When shooting HEIC or JPEG (ie when you&#39;re not shooting ProRAW), all focal ranges from 1.0 to 1.9 produce 24MP images. It&#39;s effectively using computational photography to do <em>optical</em> zoom in this range from a the fixed-length main camera. In a certain sense it&#39;s cropping, but it&#39;s far removed from any simplistic cropping. There&#39;s nothing magic about these particular stops between 1× and 2× other than the fact that 28 and 35mm equivalents have long been very popular focal lengths in traditional photography. You can “zoom” to any focal length between 1–1.9× and you&#39;ll still get a 24MP image: 1.4×, 1.7×, 1.9×, whatever. 1.2× and 1.5× get special treatment in the Camera app simply because 28 and 35mm equivalents are so popular, and I believe Apple&#39;s image processing pipeline is optimized for these lengths. [ <strong>Update:</strong> I originally wrote that you get 24MP images from 1.0–2.0×, but that was slightly mistaken — once you go from 1.9× to 2.0×, resolution drops to 12MP, presumably because at 2.0× the iPhone is using a precise center crop of the 48MP sensor.]</p><p> By default, when you repeatedly tap the 1× focal length button in the Camera app viewfinder, it cycles between 1.0/1.2/1.5×, and momentarily shows you the traditional equivalent after switching (24/28/35mm, respectively). You can adjust these options in the Camera section of the Settings app, including changing the default from 1× to 1.2× or 1.5×. For example, to simplify your options, you might consider turning off the preset for 1.2×/28mm, so that the 1× button in the viewfinder just toggles between 1.0 and 1.5×. I&#39;m not sure what I want to do yet, personally, but I&#39;m leaning toward keeping all three available, but changing my default to 1.5×/35mm, which I consider generally more natural looking for scenes and more flattering to human subjects.</p><p> You could always get the equivalent of these focal lengths by “zooming” to 1.2× or 1.5× in the Camera app, but now you keep more native resolution from the image sensor.</p><p> It&#39;s also worth noting that this improvement to the Photonic Engine comes to the non-pro iPhones 15 too, on their main camera, which also now sports a 48MP sensor. However, the non-pro iPhone 15 models don&#39;t get the feature that treats 1.2×/28mm and 1.5×/35mm as discrete “lenses”. And the hardware story is <em>not</em> as simple as “This year&#39;s non-pro iPhone 15 gets the 1× camera system from last year&#39;s iPhone 14 Pro”. The 1× lens on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus is a 26mm equivalent focal distance; the 1× lens on the iPhone 14 Pro (and this year&#39;s 15 Pro models) is a 24mm equivalent. In my brief testing, the 1× hardware lens on the iPhone 15 models is noticeably inferior (or, if you prefer, less <em>pro</em> ) to that on the Pro models, including last year&#39;s iPhone 14 Pro. Shooting side-by-side in the same lighting, images from the iPhone 15 look flatter and lack vibrancy and contrast compared to those from the iPhone 15 (or 14) Pro. The camera system on the non-pro iPhones 15 seems fine, but if you care about photography, you want to get an iPhone Pro. It&#39;s not just that the iPhones Pro have a telephoto lens and the non-pro ones don&#39;t; the images from the main camera are noticeably better on iPhones Pro.</p><hr /><p> Another significant improvement this year is a much-improved Portrait mode. Apple claims improvements that boost detail and dynamic range, but the main improvement is that you no longer need to manually select Portrait mode before capturing. You can simply capture images using the regular still photo mode, and if a person, dog, or cat is detected, Portrait mode will be available via an “ƒ” button in the viewfinder, and you can toggle it off and on while shooting, and make adjustments to the background blur and focal distance in post. You get the same on-the-fly Portrait mode with the front-facing camera, too, on all iPhone 15 models.</p><p> I expect this to make a significant practical difference in my photography. In many situations, shooting candid pictures of friends and family, I just take out my iPhone, open the Camera app, frame the image, and start shooting — quickly and discreetly. When the moment feels fleeting, I don&#39;t feel like I have time to futz with a manual switch to Portrait mode. A quick check of my Photos library shows that out of about 2,800 photos I shot with the iPhone 14 Pro in the last year, 233 were in Portrait mode. Those are some of my favorite photos of the last year, but I expect to wind up with way more Portrait mode photos this year, thanks to the dynamic on-the-fly application of Portrait mode. It&#39;s a can&#39;t-lose feature, because if you&#39;re ever unhappy with the way a picture looks in Portrait mode, you can simply turn it off in post, and you&#39;ll wind up with the same image you would have had even if this automatic Portrait mode feature didn&#39;t exist.</p><p> Lastly, now seems like a good place to reiterate that these new features all work with zero shutter lag. To date this has been a hard and fast rule for Apple&#39;s Camera team — everything happens instantaneously, and can be previewed live in the viewfinder before you capture. It&#39;s intriguing to ponder what features Apple could enable if they allowed iPhones to “develop” photos for a few seconds after capture, but I think I understand why they don&#39;t. Once you allow some features to take post-capture processing time, it&#39;s a slippery slope to an overall camera experience that feels slow and laggy. The iPhone camera has always felt fast and snappy, and the iPhone 15 lineup is no exception.</p><hr /><p> That brings us to the elephant in the room: the 5× lens exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. If you prefer a larger iPhone, well, you&#39;re in luck, because you get that lens with the iPhone size you prefer. But if, like me, you prefer the regular-size iPhones, but, all things considered, would prefer the longest available telephoto lens, you have a decision to make.</p><p> Qualitatively the new 5× lens seems about as good as the recent 3× telephoto iPhone Pro lenses. Which is to say it&#39;s fine, for a telephoto lens on a tiny (relative to “real” cameras) phone, but it&#39;s nowhere near as good as the main camera. The 3D sensor-shift module seems to work like a charm to keep things stable — a real challenge at focal lengths like this. If you find yourself frequently wishing for more than 3× optical zoom with your current iPhone camera, you&#39;re probably going to like this 5× lens a lot.</p><p> Me, though, I just don&#39;t shoot many telephoto lens pictures or videos. Again, looking at my personal Photos library (and <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/10/find-photos-taken-by-specific-iphone-lenses/">using Smart Albums to sort images by camera and lens</a> ), out of roughly 2,800 photos I&#39;ve taken with my iPhone 14 Pro, only 170 used the 3× telephoto lens. As a point of reference, 417 were shot with the ultra wide 0.5× lens, which includes all macro shots. Tallying up my lens usage for the last year reiterates my gut feeling: my ideal <em>hypothetical</em> iPhone might be an iPhone 15 Pro Mini, even if that meant having only two camera lenses instead of three, if those two cameras were the same 0.5× ultra wide and 1× main cameras as the actual iPhone 15 Pro models.</p><p> The biggest potential problem I might have with that hypothetical iPhone 15 Pro Mini of my dreams would be battery life, not the missing telephoto lens. I do occasionally use the telephoto lens I have, and I&#39;m sure I will again this year, but not enough to justify an overall larger phone. Your mileage, of course, may vary. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@panzer/post/CxYFzp7Bf10">Some people</a> love shooting with long lenses. Me, though, even when shooting with standalone cameras that use interchangeable lenses, I&#39;ve only ever bought prime lenses in the 28mm to 50mm range. I zoom with my feet.</p><p> One hitch with the iPhone Pro Max having a 5× telephoto lens is that if you really want a 3-4× focal length for framing, it needs to be digitally zoomed from the main camera. In my testing this doesn&#39;t seem to make much difference, but more talented photographers might disagree. I tend to think that when I do want a long lens with extra reach, I might as well go really long.</p><p> In past years when the Plus-sized iPhones have had exclusive camera lenses, those lenses made their way down to the regular-size iPhones in the next model year. So I suspect Apple&#39;s plan is for next year&#39;s iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max to both have 5× telephoto cameras based on this tetraprism design. I hope so, but if that doesn&#39;t happen and 5× remains exclusive to the Max, so be it. The main camera is where the action is for me — and that main camera has seen another terrific year-over-year upgrade with the 15 Pro models.</p><h2> Action Button</h2><p> It&#39;s a little thing, literally, but I dig the new Action button.</p><p> A decade ago I was bewildered by the fact that of all the things Android phone makers had shamelessly copied from the iPhone, the mute switch wasn&#39;t one of them. But then the iPad dropped its physical mute switch, and I could see the trade-off inherent to a physical switch: software control. With a physical mute switch, silent mode can&#39;t be controlled by software, because software can&#39;t flip the physical switch. (Carmakers, to name one common example, face this same dilemma with dashboard knobs and switches.) If a hardware button, knob, or switch has state, then that statefulness can&#39;t be controlled by software unless the software can push, twist, or flip the physical controls.</p><p> If you just want a mute toggle, the new Action button is, I think, as good if not better than the old mute switch. No matter what action you assign to the button, it activates with a long-press, but that long-press delay is pretty short — it&#39;s just long enough to avoid accidental activations, and is short enough that it never feels slow. When assigned to toggling silent mode, you get a quick series of haptic taps when it goes into silent mode, and one haptic tap when it goes out of silent mode. It&#39;s easy to tell the haptics apart, if you&#39;re using it without looking at it (like, say, if your iPhone is in your pocket or purse).</p><p> Because I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time testing the new cameras, I&#39;ve spent most of the last week with the Action button assigned to the Camera app. For many years now Apple has offered a shortcut to jump into the Camera app from the lock screen. There&#39;s a button you can long-press in the lower-right corner of the lock screen, but the quickest way is to swipe right-to-left anywhere on the lock screen. I went into this thinking I might leave my Action button set to toggle silent mode, on the grounds that we already have these shortcuts for jumping into the Camera app, but one thing that&#39;s become clear to me these past few days is that assigning the Action button to Camera is super useful when you want to jump to the Camera app <em>while your iPhone is unlocked because you&#39;re already using it</em> . It&#39;s cool and useful to have a button that always jumps you right into Camera no matter what state your iPhone is in.</p><p> So at the moment, I&#39;m a bit torn between assigning my Action button to act as a mute switch or as a Camera launcher. Which brings me to another intriguing option: Shortcuts.</p><p> I created a simple workflow in Shortcuts that shows a menu with three options: Photo, Video, and Mute/Unmute. The Photo and Video options jump you to the corresponding shooting mode in the Camera app, and the Mute/Unmute option reverses the current setting for Silent mode. Shortcuts has built-in actions to enable and disable Silent mode on the device, but doesn&#39;t have a built-in way to <em>get</em> the current Silent mode state. For that, my shortcut uses an action from the excellent free (and aptly-named) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171">Actions utility by Sindre Sorhus</a> . When Silent mode is engaged, the command is “🔊 Unmute”; when Silent mode is off, the command is “🔇 Mute”. (Now that there isn&#39;t a physical switch to inspect, when Silent mode is engaged, the iPhones 15 Pro <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/09/silent-mode-status-bar-icon.jpeg">show a bell-with-line-through-it icon in the status bar</a> , in the top left corner next to the time or carrier name. But it felt clever to make the menu item in my shortcut dynamically reflect the current state.) <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9f0890e7896349b8875b0e352618f4d9">Here&#39;s the shortcut</a> , if you&#39;re interested, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/09/action-button-shortcut.png">here&#39;s a screenshot</a> showing it in, err, action.</p><p> Is a menu like this a good use of the Action button? I&#39;m not sure yet, but it sure is fun. The iPhones 15 Pro now have a dedicated hardware button that <em>anyone</em> can program using Shortcuts. I love it. One DF reader emailed me last week wondering if you can assign the Action button to act like an old-school Home button. You can, with Shortcuts. I can&#39;t wait to see what others come up with.</p><p> [ <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/22/current-action-button-shortcut">I made a better version of this shortcut</a> . Instead of showing a menu you need to choose from, it opens the Camera app <em>unless</em> the phone is face down or upside down, in which cases it toggles the state of Silent mode. I&#39;ve been using it this way for two days now and love it.]</p><h2> USB-C</h2><p> The overwhelming consensus seems to be that Apple only switched from Lightning to USB-C with the iPhones 15 due to the regulatory mandate from the EU. And, conversely, that Apple stayed with Lightning this long — and if not for the EU regulation would stay with it for years to come — because they&#39;re rolling in revenue from <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">MFi licensing fees</a> .</p><p> To the first part of that — that Apple only switched because the EU forced their hand — I say <em>Well, maybe</em> . It&#39;s obviously a factor. The EU is too big a market for Apple to walk away from. But the USB-C mandate doesn&#39;t kick in until next year, and existing devices from 2023 and earlier will still be allowed when the regulation does kick in. So the iPhones 15 could have had Lightning ports and remained available in the EU for years to come. It&#39;s next year when Apple would have to switch.</p><p> And if Apple really wanted to stick with Lightning, they could, in theory, make USB-C iPhones only for the EU market, and limit them all to the same USB 2 transfer speeds as Lightning. That would make for a supply chain hassle, to be sure, but it seems like less of a hassle than making <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209086">iPhones with two SIM card trays just for the Hong Kong and Chinese markets</a> .</p><p> As for the second part of the consensus thinking on why Apple has stuck with Lightning — that it&#39;s an MFi licensing money grab — I say <em>Hogwash</em> . Multiple sources have confirmed for me that MFi licensing revenue for Lightning devices and cables is negligible, just a rounding error by Apple&#39;s standards. But consider the arrogance of thinking that Apple would spitefully hold the iPhone back just for a bit of licensing revenue. That Apple would knowingly make the iPhone <em>worse</em> for no benefit other than their own financial bottom line. That&#39;s bonkers. I think the opposite is true: Apple pulls no punches when it comes to making the iPhone as good as it can possibly be for the most customers, even to the detriment of Apple&#39;s other devices. For one thing, it would make more sense for bleeding edge Apple silicon to be designed first for the Mac, and to trickle down to the iPhone in subsequent years. But instead, Apple silicon is designed for and ships first for the iPhone, and then flows up to the Mac and iPad. The iPhone gets Apple&#39;s best silicon (now on a 3nm process, the first in the world for any consumer product), best displays, and best materials (now titanium). It is the best device Apple can possibly make given the constraints of reasonable pricing and the inordinate scale at which it needs to produce them. No effort is spared — year after year after year. And nothing, not even a global year-plus-long pandemic, could knock it off its annual schedule. Apple loves all its products, but it loves the iPhone most.</p><p> And but we&#39;re supposed to believe that Apple deliberately made the iPhone&#39;s charging and data port <em>worse</em> , for years, for a fistful or two of dollars? My god, the sheer arrogance it takes to believe that Apple takes for granted an iota of the iPhone&#39;s success and enduring popularity.</p><p> The simple fact is that Apple kept all iPhones on Lightning while it thought staying on Lightning was the best choice for the most customers. I know that there have been engineers inside Apple — engineers who helped invent both Lightning and USB-C — who&#39;ve been advocating for the iPhone to switch from Lightning ever since USB-C debuted in MacBooks in 2015. Maybe Apple should have switched sooner. But there were good reasons not to, mostly surrounding the trust involved in building an ecosystem. When they switched from the 30-pin connector to Lightning, Phil Schiller said it would be the connector for “the next decade”. That was the iPhone 5 in 2012.</p><p> In actual use, I have to say it is a little weird having USB-C on the iPhone. I got curious and connected an iPhone 15 Pro to my iPad Pro to see what would happen. The first time, the iPhone started charging the iPad. That wasn&#39;t what I expected, and from what I gather, isn&#39;t supposed to happen. I unplugged the cable and tried again, and the same thing happened: the iPhone charged the iPad. I unplugged the cable and swapped one side of the cable for the other, and this time the iPad started charging the iPhone, as though the cable had a direction for charging. Craziness. I tried again and the iPad (a 2018 11-inch iPad Pro running iPadOS 17) crashed. I expect Apple will straighten this out, but I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s buggy at the moment.</p><p> Overall, though, it just isn&#39;t that big a deal. It&#39;s nice to know that 10 Gbps USB 3 transfer speeds are available for the iPhones 15 Pro — 20 times faster than the USB 2 limit of 480 Mbps (which remains the cap on the non-pro iPhone 15 models). But it&#39;s irritating, as with all things related to “USB-C” cables, that you&#39;ll need special (and more expensive) cables to achieve those transfer speeds, and there&#39;s no way to identify which cables support which transfer speeds just by looking at them, unless they have the Thunderbolt logo on the connector — but expensive, thick Thunderbolt cables are overkill for USB 3 data transfer. The cables that ship with all iPhone 15 models are nice, white <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-19"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-19">2</a></sup> braided cables, but are not high-speed USB 3 cables. ( <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/category/cables/usb-&amp;-lightning-cables/usb-c-cables?menuDisStr=usb%20c%20cables&amp;v_Connector_A_uFilter=USB-C&amp;v_Connector_B_uFilter=USB-C&amp;v_Wattage_uFilter=100&amp;v_Bandwidth_uFilter=10Gbps&amp;TotalProducts=4">These cables from Monoprice are good options</a> .)</p><p> The reason Apple opposed (and continues to oppose, even as their product line falls into compliance) the EU&#39;s USB-C port mandate isn&#39;t because they wanted to stick with Lightning forever. Why did they start migrating the iPad lineup from Lightning to USB-C back in 2018 if they were all-in on Lightning forever? The big problem isn&#39;t that they&#39;re required to ship USB-C ports in all products next year — it&#39;s that they&#39;ll be required to continue shipping USB-C ports in perpetuity until the regulation is revised or rescinded, and regulations like this tend never to be revised nor rescinded. If you think USB-C is a “forever port” that will never be bettered by a superior design, you&#39;ve got nothing to worry about. But Apple doesn&#39;t think that way. Someday there will be a port that&#39;s better than USB-C, and <em>that</em> ’s when this EU regulation is going to pose a problem, because that future port is almost certain to be a proprietary one, not an open standard from the USB consortium, among whose members there exists but one company that I know of that had the good taste never to ship a single product using the gross Micro-USB or Mini-USB ports. Which of those companies is pushing for something better than USB-C?</p><p> There will be a successor to USB-C eventually. It&#39;ll probably be invented by Apple. The best we can hope for is that that successor will be inductive, or even over-the-air wireless, and thus not subject to the EU&#39;s plug mandate.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-19"><p> There&#39;s a fourth major new camera feature this year for the 15 Pro models: shooting spatial video, ideal for consumption on the forthcoming Vision Pro. But shooting spatial video on the iPhone 15 Pro is “coming later this year”. Apple has not made available to reviewers pre-release software that enables it, nor was it available to demonstrate last week at the event in Cupertino. So not only have I not been able to try shooting it, I haven&#39;t even been able to see what a spatial video looks like when played back on an iPhone display.

<p>Among the oft-quoted Alan Kay&#39;s <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/alan-kay-quotes">numerous aphorisms</a> is “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” A sort-of corollary to that, which I believe, is that the best way to appreciate new technology is to go back to using an older version.</p><p> A few weeks ago I was running late for an appointment I&#39;d be walking to here in Philadelphia. Most everywhere I walk, I wear my AirPods Pro 2, but that day I couldn&#39;t find them, and I was late enough that I didn&#39;t have time to search. I was terribly worried I&#39;d be alone with my own thoughts for the entire journey, but my old first-generation AirPods Pro were sitting on my desk, and they still had a charge, so I wore those instead.</p><p> I remember thinking <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/thoughts_and_observations_on_last_weeks_far_out_apple_event">last year</a> , when I first upgraded from the original AirPods Pro to the AirPods Pro 2, that the new ones sounded at least a little better and that both Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation modes were much improved. But going back to the original AirPods Pro for just one afternoon walking around the city really brought home just how much improved the AirPods Pro 2 are. Transparency mode and Noise Cancellation are <em>way</em> better, and more strikingly, just the audio quality difference alone was obvious. After a year as a near-daily user of AirPods Pro 2, I now find the audio quality of the first-generation ones to be thin and tinny. I was downright blown away by the difference.</p><p> Last week Apple announced a minor revision to the AirPods Pro 2. They now come with a USB-C charging port on the case (instead of Lightning), and some sort of upgrade to the H2 chip in the earbuds of the revised models will enable low-latency lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset when that product ships next year.</p><p> I&#39;ve been wearing a pair of the revised AirPods Pro 2 earbuds since last week, paired with my year-old iPhone 14 Pro and a few other devices. I obviously can&#39;t say anything about their special capabilities when paired with a Vision Pro, but in all regards related to currently-shipping features, they&#39;re better than ever.</p><p> As of today a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213317">firmware update</a> is available for all AirPods models. For the second-generation AirPods Pro — both the year-old ones with Lightning and the new ones with USB-C — this is a <em>major</em> feature update. Tweaked features include the option to mute/unmute yourself with a click of an earbud stem while using AirPods during a phone or VoIP call, and improvements to both Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation modes. But the update also brings two new features.</p><p> The first new feature is Conversation Awareness, <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">which Apple describes thus</a> :</p><blockquote><p> When you&#39;re wearing AirPods Pro and need to speak with someone nearby, Conversation Awareness automatically lowers the volume of what&#39;s playing, enhances voices in front of you, and reduces background noise.</p></blockquote><p> When enabled (all AirPods options are set in the Settings app on iOS or MacOS), Conversation Awareness really is completely automatic. If you&#39;re listening to music or a podcast and just start talking to someone, or if someone else just starts talking to you, it kicks in. It&#39;s very clever, but whether you&#39;ll enjoy it highly depends upon your listening environment. In my 5+ days of testing, it kicked in too frequently amidst a crowd of people, none of whom were talking to me. Sometimes on city sidewalks, oftentimes in a grocery store. In an urban environment, there are just too many people talking <em>around</em> me, and the AirPods have no way of knowing that they&#39;re not talking <em>to</em> me, for this feature to be anything but an annoyance overall. But it&#39;s definitely accurate: it always kicks in when I start talking, and every time it has kicked in when someone else was talking near me, even when they weren&#39;t talking <em>to</em> me, I could tell whose voice it was that the AirPods detected. File this feature under “Not for me personally, but you might love it.”</p><p> The second new feature is a new listening mode: Adaptive Audio. One way to think of Adaptive Audio is as a mid-point between Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). That&#39;s how Apple describes it:</p><blockquote><p> The H2-powered AirPods Pro now feature Adaptive Audio, automatically prioritizing sounds that need your attention as you move through the world. By seamlessly blending Active Noise Cancellation with Transparency mode when you need it, Adaptive Audio magically delivers the right mix of sound for any environment.</p></blockquote><p> Feel free to roll your eyes (or ears) at technology being described as “magical”, but damned if I can come up with a more apt adjective. In my (admittedly brief) testing time, Adaptive Audio seems more like a next-generation, even smarter replacement for Transparency mode. I&#39;ve set mine to toggle between just two modes when I long-press either AirPod stem: Adaptive and ANC. If you&#39;d like, you can add regular Transparency as a third mode you toggle between, but I haven&#39;t yet found an environment where I&#39;d want plain Transparency instead of Adaptive. Transparency with AirPods Pro 2 has been great as an urban pedestrian; Adaptive is even better. It just automatically Does What I Want™ in seemingly every context. I hear traffic and passersby, but even loud trucks and buses passing by don&#39;t keep me from clearly hearing the podcast (typically) or song (less typically) I&#39;m listening to.</p><p> Perhaps my usage scenarios are in the sweet spot for what Adaptive Audio is good at — the opposite of how my usage scenarios are <em>not</em> good for Conversation Awareness. But from my time using them, I don&#39;t even see why Adaptive Audio isn&#39;t a replacement for Transparency. For me, so far, it&#39;s just Transparency but better, with more on-the-fly dynamic adjustments. It&#39;s fantastic. (Perhaps battery life is one reason to keep plain Transparency mode around, but I have zero complaints about the battery life I&#39;ve gotten these past five days.)</p><p> If you already use AirPods Pro, you know there are cute sounds that play when you switch modes. Each mode gets its own unique tone, and the tones for Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation sort of sound like the opposite of each other. The tones suggest “opening” and “closing” the world around you as you toggle them. Adaptive Audio has a new tone, which I&#39;d describe as spritely or joyful. It&#39;s the sort of sound you can imagine a fairy&#39;s magic wand making in a kid&#39;s movie. It&#39;s a fun sound for a fun mode, and I can&#39;t help but take the joyfulness of this tone as a subtle suggestion from Apple that this is the “best” mode for most people in most scenarios, other than the obvious situations where you want full-on immersive Active Noise Cancellation.</p><p> The Vision Pro is Apple&#39;s initial foray into spatial computing. But Vision Pro is <em>not</em> Apple&#39;s first product in the world of augmented reality: AirPods Pro (and to a lesser degree, at the moment, AirPods Max) are. We humans are visual creatures and we naturally tend to think of augmented reality as a primarily visual experience, but AirPods Pro offer profoundly enjoyable and useful augmentation of the aural world around you. Starting today, Adaptive Audio takes that to another level.</p><p> Adaptive Audio is only available for the AirPods Pro 2, which means I&#39;m only going to be more irritated if I ever again find myself wearing my old first-generation AirPods Pro out of necessity. At this point AirPods Pro 2 are as much better than the original AirPods Pro than the original AirPods Pro seemed from the original non-pro AirPods. They&#39;re far more than wireless earbuds — they&#39;re clever, powerful, delightful computers you put in your ears. I&#39;ll close with what I wrote about them <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/thoughts_and_observations_on_last_weeks_far_out_apple_event">a year ago</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The new AirPods Pro are the best single expression of Apple as a company today. Not the most important product, not the most complicated, not the most essential. But the one that exemplifies everything Apple is trying to do. They are simple, they are useful, and they offer features that <em>most</em> people use and want. Most people use headphones. A lot of people use them every day — in noisy environments. AirPods Pro are — for any scenario where big over-ear-style headphones are impractical — the best headphones in the world.</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ AirPods Pro 2, Now With USB-C Charging Case</title></entry><entry><title> Kolide — Device Trust for Okta </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40241</id><published> 2023-09-18T20:21:57Z</published><updated> 2023-09-18T20:21:58Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is chock-a-block with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: drafting emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk: malware, data governance, and prompt injection attacks.</p><p> Kolide is taking a two-part approach to governing AI use: allowing you to draft AI policies <em>as a team</em> , and using Kolide to block malicious tools. <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Today Is Release Day for iOS 17 and Its Sibling OS&#39;s </title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-ios-17/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1s" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/ios-17-release-day" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40240</id><published> 2023-09-18T20:06:21Z</published><updated> 2023-09-18T20:06:21Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MacOS 14 Sonoma is coming next Tuesday, September 26, but all the other annual new major versions of Apple&#39;s platforms are out today: iOS and iPadOS 17, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-watchos-10/">WatchOS 10</a> (which really rejiggers the way WatchOS is organized), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-tvos-17/">tvOS 17</a> , and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-homepod-17-software/">the iOS 17 “firmware” variant for HomePods</a> .</p><p> Also, today marks the availability of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-expands-the-power-of-icloud-with-new-icloud-plus-plans/">the new 6 and 12 TB storage tiers for iCloud+</a> .

<p>Paresh Dave, writing for Wired:</p><blockquote><p> <a href="https://pebble.is/">Pebble</a> , a Twitter-style service formerly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-startup-t2-wants-to-terminate-twitter/">known as T2</a> , today launched a new approach: Users can skip past its “What&#39;s happening?” nudge and click on a tab labeled Ideas with a lightbulb icon, to view a list of AI-generated posts or replies inspired by their past activity. Publishing one of those suggestions after reviewing it takes a single click.</p><p> Gabor Cselle, Pebble&#39;s CEO, says this and generative AI features to come will enable a kinder, safer, and more fun experience. “We want to make sure that you see great content, that you&#39;re posting great content, and that you&#39;re interacting with the community,” he says.</p></blockquote><p> Pebble, heretofore known as T2, had been in a similar place as Bluesky — a would-be direct replacement/alternative to Twitter, but hamstrung for growth by being invite-only. With this name change Pebble is open to all, using a system where Twitter/X users can claim the same handle on Pebble.</p><p> I&#39;ve had <a href="https://pebble.is/gruber/status/268153">an account</a> for months, but find myself seldom using it. If Pebble&#39;s status IDs are sequential, there have only been about 270,000 total posts made on the platform to date. There just isn&#39;t much action there, even compared to Bluesky. And there&#39;s really only so much time in the day to check in with multiple very similar social networks. I think there&#39;s room for several Twitter-like services to thrive, but not for half a dozen of them.</p><p> But also, the Pebble team made the same decision as Post, another would-be-Twitter-replacement upstart that hasn&#39;t gained traction: they don&#39;t have an app, only a website that you can use like an app on your phone. [ <strong>Update:</strong> Post did launch web-only, but <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/post-news/id6448645663">now does have an app</a> .] Has there ever been a successful social network in the last decade that didn&#39;t debut with an app for iOS? Bluesky&#39;s app isn&#39;t great, but it&#39;s better than a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">PWA</a> , and I wonder how many normal people out there just don&#39;t trust apps that don&#39;t come from the App Store or Google Play. And, putting trust aside, I wonder how many people even know about adding PWAs to their home screens.</p><p> It&#39;s very telling, I think, that Meta launched Threads <em>only</em> as a native app for iOS and Android, and even the web app version came over a month later. That big high-profile Threads launch would have been much smaller if they&#39;d launched web-first.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Twitter Competitor T2 Rebrands as ‘Pebble’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/t2-is-now-pebble">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Panos Panay Is Leaving Microsoft, Just Days Ahead of Their Surface Event </title><link href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1703776961296998693" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1q" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/panay-leaving-microsoft-for-amazon" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40238</id><published> 2023-09-18T18:59:29Z</published><updated> 2023-09-18T18:59:30Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Panos Panay, on Twitter/X:</p><blockquote><p> After 19 incredible years at Microsoft, I&#39;ve decided to turn the page and write the next chapter. I&#39;m forever grateful for my time at Microsoft and the amazing people I had the honor to make products with.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878609/microsoft-windows-panos-panay-leaving">Emma Roth, reporting for The Verge</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Panay&#39;s departure from Microsoft is somewhat abrupt. Just last month, <a href="https://x.com/panos_panay/status/1696184684303315420?s=20">Panay mentioned he was excited</a> to appear at Microsoft&#39;s special event that&#39;s set to take place on Thursday, September 21st, where the company is poised to reveal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23874096/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-2-leak-specs">the latest additions to its Surface lineup</a> and “AI innovation.” However, Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw tells The Verge Panay will not appear at this week&#39;s event.</p></blockquote><p> The timing on this is so awkward, given that the Surface event — that Panay was presumably set to emcee — is just three days from now. Microsoft&#39;s terse statement and Panos&#39;s tone in the tweet make it seem acrimonious, but not scandalous.</p><p> And lo, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/amazon-is-poised-to-hire-departing-microsoft-product-chief">Dina Bass and Matt Day report for Bloomberg</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Amazon.com Inc. is hiring Microsoft Corp.&#39;s product chief to run the division responsible for the voice-activated Alexa assistant and Echo smart speakers, according to people familiar with the situation. Panos Panay, an almost 20-year veteran who led Microsoft&#39;s Windows team and was central to the company&#39;s hardware push with its Surface computers, said Monday he&#39;s leaving the technology giant.</p><p> Dave Limp, the longtime Amazon hardware chief, said last month that he would retire before the end of the year.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://wormsandviruses.com/2023/09/panos-panay-out-at-microsoft/">Jack Wellborn</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I have mixed opinions on Panos Panay.</p></blockquote><p> Same here. Panos without question elevated Microsoft to be a major player in PC hardware, but looking back, I don&#39;t see any of their devices as iconic.

<p>Benjamin Mayo, 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> Although these accessories are technically obsoleted by today&#39;s announcements, you can still buy them on sites like Amazon ( <a href="https://amzn.to/3RrfmiA">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZkRKOh">MagSafe Duo Charger</a> ) while supplies last, if so desired.</p><p> It&#39;s unclear if Apple plans to introduce USB-C versions of these accessories in the future, or if these products have reached their natural end-of-life anyway. It&#39;s never quite clear how popular Apple&#39;s iPhone accessories are, after all.</p></blockquote><p> The Duo Charger was a good concept, especially for traveling, but modern iPhones are too big for it, and it didn&#39;t support the new higher-speed charging for recent Apple Watches.</p><p> But the MagSafe Battery Pack is a flat-out <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-micro-review/">great product</a> I&#39;m sad to see disappear, and might still be something you&#39;d want to buy while supplies last. Travel with one, and you can charge a new iPhone 15 using either a USB-C cable (plugged into the phone) <em>or</em> a Lightning cable (plugged into the battery pack). Either way, the other device will get charged via the two-way MagSafe connection.</p><p> Before the MagSafe Battery Pack, Apple sold a series of battery cases for some older iPhone generations. You remember them — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/10/tim-cook-defends-apple-iphone-smart-battery-case-hump">they looked a bit weird</a> , because the battery part was like a pregnant hump. Apple never once released a battery case at the same time the corresponding iPhones were announced. They&#39;d announce the iPhones in September, then release the battery packs like two months later, without fanfare. I&#39;ve always suspected this was deliberate — that Apple did not want to announce an external battery pack or case at the same time as new iPhones to avoid the possibility of even <em>some</em> of the news coverage for the new iPhones suggesting that they <em>need</em> an external battery pack because the built-in battery is insufficient.</p><p> So, maybe Apple is simply done selling the MagSafe Battery Pack. But, even if they have a new USB-C version in the works, I&#39;m not at all surprised that it wasn&#39;t released last week. Let&#39;s wait for November. I hope they do release one, because Apple&#39;s MagSafe Battery Pack is far better than the third-party ones I&#39;ve tried (including two decent ones from Anker). Apple&#39;s isn&#39;t the biggest, but it&#39;s the best because it&#39;s the smartest. It negotiates intelligently with the iPhone when connected and doesn&#39;t waste energy charging the iPhone past 80 percent or so. You can feel the difference in efficiency by heat alone. Third-party inductive battery packs get quite warm; Apple&#39;s doesn&#39;t. Also, the third-party ones seem to all be “magnetic”, not officially “MagSafe” — Apple&#39;s sticks better too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Is No Longer Selling the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Folding Charger’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/16/magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo-charger">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Why the iPhones 15 Pro Feel So Much Lighter </title><link href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-facts-and-estimates/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/16/iphone-15-pro-moment-of-inertia" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40236</id><published> 2023-09-16T19:31:34Z</published><updated> 2023-09-16T19:31:35Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Dr. Drang:</p><blockquote><p> Finally, we come to Jason Snell&#39;s surprise at how light the 15 Pro seemed when he played with it in the hands-on area. He mentioned this not only in his <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2065050/iphone-15-pro-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-hands-on.html">Macworld article</a> , but also in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/476">the post-keynote episode of Upgrade</a> .

How can that be?</p><p> One answer is that people are just more sensitive than we give them credit for being.

<p>Was Tuesday&#39;s “Wonderlust” event mostly predictable?是的。 Does that mean it was boring? For some people, yes. But for most people, it was the biggest tech news event of the year, just like Apple&#39;s iPhone event is every year of late.</p><p> That&#39;s weird and new, historically — and for many tech enthusiasts, disappointing. The way tech has traditionally worked is that company fortunes wax and wane over the course of each decade. And the big new “tech product of the year” not only changes from one company to another every few years, it changes across product categories. From PCs to PDAs to digital cameras to iPods. <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-15">1</a></sup></p><p> But for the past decade, the biggest event on the entire tech calendar has been Apple&#39;s annual introduction of new iPhones. You can argue that it should not be the biggest event of the year, but it objectively is, media-coverage-wise. I&#39;m not sure I know a single person who isn&#39;t at least aware of the fact that Apple just announced new iPhones this week. That alone is extraordinary. It&#39;s a lot like the Super Bowl, which often isn&#39;t even the best football game of the year, let alone sporting event, but is undeniably the biggest. Even people who don&#39;t watch it know when the Super Bowl is played. But even the Super Bowl is just a US phenomenon — the iPhone event is worldwide, more like the World Cup or Olympics, but the World Cup and Olympics are only held every four years.</p><p> And in the same way that the Super Bowl garners media attention from far outside the world of sports journalism, so too do the iPhone events attract media coverage from outside the world of tech. There&#39;s just a totally different and unique vibe attending the iPhone events in person. There&#39;s a buzz, a sense of hustle and anticipation, and most of all a palpable sense of unimaginably high stakes that pervades these iPhone events from the perspective of a media attendee. You can say these events are boring because they&#39;re predictable, but Apple needs every iPhone generation to be a hit product, the press knows it, and the press is always looking for a slip-up to dwell on, like the antennagate nonsense controversy back in 2010 with the iPhone 4. <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-15">2</a></sup> Die-hard sports fans are annoyed by all the non-sporting aspects surrounding the Super Bowl, like the attention focused on the halftime concert performers and even the TV commercials. Die-hard tech fans are likewise annoyed by the “what planet have you been on?” coverage of new iPhone details the rest of us knew were coming for like the last year. Exhibit A: this week&#39;s mainstream news coverage being <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+usb-c&amp;iar=news&amp;df=w&amp;ia=news">utterly dominated</a> by the switch from Lightning to USB-C.</p><p> The Steve Jobs Theater is a wonderful place and these iPhone events are, to me, fascinating experiences. ( <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CxGiLfSPqOX">I shot a video Tuesday</a> that attempts to capture the layout and experience of the post-keynote hands-on area scrum.) But they&#39;re not at all interesting in the sense of “Boy I wonder what Apple is going to announce today.” It&#39;s more like intense interest regarding <em>how</em> Apple chooses to frame announcements that we all know are coming. And it makes perfect, but boring, sense, to pair the introduction of new iPhones with the introduction of new Apple Watches and, this year, updated AirPods Pro. <sup id="fnr3-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn3-2023-09-15">3</a></sup></p><p> Again, though, this isn&#39;t how the tech industry is “supposed” to work. All things come to an end, and eventually that truism will apply to the iPhone, but the fact is that for over a decade Apple&#39;s September iPhone events have been the Super Bowls of technology. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">Iterative</a> phone designs from the same company, year after year after year. No other event compares. You can add the next 10 events together — including Apple&#39;s — and you won&#39;t get the cumulative electricity of the iPhone event. This, despite the fact that the iPhone events are predictable. There&#39;s never been anything like it, quite possibly never will be again, and a lot of tech enthusiasts resent it.</p><p> But there&#39;s no denying that this is true. Apple has a formula and that formula continues to work.</p><h2> Environment</h2><p> The 20-minute <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/mother-nature/">“Mother Nature” sketch</a> in the keynote, with Octavia Spencer in the titular role, has been <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/13/apples-mother-nature-sketch-was-a-complete-dud-and-didnt-belong-in-the-iphone-15-event">widely</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/apple-mocked-cringey-sketch-touting-companys-climate-change-efforts-filled-left-wing-tropes">panned</a> . I do think it went on too long — the whole segment (sketch plus details) in fact was just 10 minutes long, not 20. But seemingly everyone, including me, felt like it lasted 20 minutes, which is never a good sign.</p><p> But I get it.</p><p> The message is this: most companies today are making promises about their future environmental impact. But Apple hasn&#39;t just been making promises. They&#39;ve been accomplishing truly great feats on this front. It&#39;s no fucking joke that you can now buy an entire Apple Watch that is carbon neutral. Apple has made drastic changes in the materials it uses, the way it ships products around the world, the way it packages them, the ways it produces its own electricity, and more. What they wanted to make clear is that this whole area is one of the company&#39;s highest priorities, truly part of its institutional moral compass, with implications for <em>everything</em> Apple does, and that they&#39;ve already accomplished great things. And that most other companies are basically just greenwashingly full of shit on this stuff.</p><p> But how can Apple make this point? They can&#39;t just put Lisa Jackson up there and call out other companies as corporate liars, even though they are. Comedy is the answer. Comedy lets you say things that can&#39;t otherwise be said. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm">Satire</a> , parody, and farce are all deceptively powerful ways to communicate serious arguments.</p><p> The problem with this segment was simply that it wasn&#39;t funny enough. It was a great concept but the result was merely OK. It needed more of a Tina Fey <em>30 Rock</em> pace — funnier jokes and more of them. (Was Apple hamstrung by the WGA strike on this? I can&#39;t help but wonder if so. The skit <em>looked</em> fine — it was the writing that felt limp.)</p><p> One landmark aspect of this segment was Apple&#39;s declaration that they&#39;re done with leather. No more leather iPhone cases, no more leather watch bands — including from Hermès. Their lucrative partnership continues, but with fabric and rubber straps alone. (Unless you buy an Apple Watch <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/15/hermes-leather-apple-watch-straps">from Hermès itself</a> .) Apple has replaced its own leather iPhone cases and watch straps with a new material they call FineWoven. I spent time in the hands-on area playing with both the new phone cases and watch straps, and I like the FineWoven material. The keynote emphasized only the ethical angles, vis-à-vis leather: carbon impact and animal rights. But for the iPhone cases at least, I think FineWoven is just plain nicer than the old leather ones. I personally like nice leather goods, but I always felt like the leather Apple used to produce iPhone cases was, at best, OK. In particular I don&#39;t think it weathered well, and I have never been a heavy user of iPhone cases, generally carrying mine un-cased. Put all the ethical issues aside and pretend that Apple were still selling leather iPhone cases alongside these new FineWoven ones, and I&#39;d rather buy a FineWoven one. I&#39;m not entirely sold on the FineWoven Apple Watch straps based on my hands-on experience, but at worst, they seem pretty nice. (Apple&#39;s leather watch straps were less expensive than the Hermès ones, but also very clearly not as nice.)</p><p> Pre-orders for the new cases have already begun arriving, and <a href="https://www.threads.net/search/?q=finewoven">reactions to the new material are mixed</a> . I&#39;m curious how it&#39;s going to weather over time, especially the watch straps, but my first impression is that this is a <em>quality</em> upgrade over Apple&#39;s leather products, not just an ethical one. I don&#39;t think the FineWoven material is nicer than fine leather, but I do think it&#39;s nicer than the leather iPhone cases Apple made, and perhaps on par with their own previous leather watch straps. And one thing that it&#39;s not is faux leather. As Jony Ive might describe it if he were still at Apple, it&#39;s unapologetically fabric.</p><h2> The Regular iPhones 15</h2><p> It seems like the iPhones 15 — non-pro — are exactly what we could have hoped for: effectively, the iPhone 14 Pro without the telephoto third camera.</p><p> That leaves me to carp about the colors, which strike me as bland and washed out, with the exception of black, which, as usual, is a very deep black indeed. Color trends change seasonally, and I should probably trust Apple&#39;s designers more than myself to stay on top of trends, but man, this lineup looks bland. Maybe pale hues are “in” this year, but I highly doubt that down the road anyone is ever going to say “Remember how great the iPhone 15 colors were?” Compare and contrast with the universal affection we all seem to share <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary">regarding the original iMacs</a> .</p><p> New this year: the regular iPhones 15 have frosted glass backs; heretofore the non-pro models had been glossy, and the Pro models frosted/matte. For the first time, the Pro and non-pro iPhones feel very much alike in hand: brushed metal sides, frosted glass backs, very similar sizes, and <em>finally</em> , similar weights.</p><p> The iPhone 15 displays are brighter, with the same contrast ratio and maximum brightness as the displays in the 15 Pro models. Missing from the non-pro iPhone 15 models, though: ProMotion dynamic refresh rates, and the always-on display mode. In turn, the lack of an always-on display means that the new StandBy feature in iOS 17 is much more useful with the Pro models. With the non-pro iPhones 15, StandBy will only show until the display times out and goes to sleep; with the iPhones Pro (including last year&#39;s 14 Pro models), StandBy is always on.</p><h2> iPhones 15 Pro</h2><p> The color selection for the Pro models fits recent trends: black (which is really more of a very dark gray), white, and a color of the year. Last year with the iPhones 14 Pro, that color was purple. This year it&#39;s blue, and it&#39;s a nice but quite dark blue. Intriguingly — and adding more grist to the argument that Apple just doesn&#39;t have much <em>fun</em> with colors of late — there&#39;s also “natural titanium”, which isn&#39;t literally natural but is achieved through a PVD tint that looks like what people <em>think</em> titanium naturally looks like. On its own, “natural titanium” looks like a neutral brushed metallic shade. Side-by-side with the iPhone 15 Pro in white, however, you can see that Apple&#39;s “natural titanium” is warmer. It doesn&#39;t look at all gold, but there&#39;s a wee touch of yellow to it. The overall effect of the natural titanium models is “premium gray”, sorta kinda along the vibes of a classic <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=james+bond+db5&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Aston Martin DB5</a> . The white ones, I think, could fairly be described as “silver” — both truly color-temperature neutral and seemingly shinier. Neither the natural nor white titanium on the iPhone 15 Pro matches the titanium body of the Apple Watch Ultra, but natural is closer.</p><p> The 15 Pro and Pro Max feel <em>so</em> much lighter in hand compared to all of the stainless steel iPhones in the post-iPhone-X era. Assuming they prove durable in real world usage, the shift from polished stainless steel to titanium is a huge win, just based on weight alone. But I also prefer the look and feel of it — slightly textured rather than highly polished. I think of my iPhone as a tool, not jewelry; a polished finish never seemed appropriate, the way it does for the steel Apple Watch models.</p><p> The rounded edge of the frame — a design change that is also in the aluminum non-pro models — is also a win. This feels like an optimal middle ground between the completely round sides of the iPhones X/XS/11 and the flat sharp-edges sides of the iPhones 12/13/14. Look for this form factor to hold steady for three generations, too — Apple is a company of patterns.</p><p> The Action button seems great. Out of the box it defaults to acting as a mute toggle, but it&#39;s easy (and arguably <a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1702082368905888058">fun</a> ) to choose another action. Built-in actions include: flashlight, launching the Camera app, starting an audio recording in Voice Memos, and Magnifier. But the options literally go infinite when you assign it to execute a Shortcuts workflow.</p><h2> RIP iPhones Mini</h2><p> I wasn&#39;t expecting the iPhone 13 Mini to remain in the lineup, but now it&#39;s official: it&#39;s gone. What a shame. It obviously wasn&#39;t popular enough but every single person I know who bought an iPhone 12 Mini or 13 Mini loved it, and dreads the idea of their next iPhone being bigger.</p><h2> AirPods Pro &#39;2.5&#39;</h2><p> If you&#39;re not paying close attention, it&#39;s easy to mistakenly believe that the only change to the AirPods Pro 2 is the connector on the charging case. But the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 are actually different <em>earbuds</em> too, effectively more like a version 2.5 or something. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-upgrades-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-with-usb-c-charging/">From Apple Newsroom</a> :</p><blockquote><p> AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are upgraded with USB‑C charging capabilities, additional dust resistance, and Lossless Audio with Apple Vision Pro. With iOS 17, all AirPods Pro (2nd generation) level up with access to new audio experiences like Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness. [...]</p><p> AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with MagSafe Charging Case (USB‑C) will enable Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency to deliver the perfect true wireless solution with Apple Vision Pro. The H2 chip in the latest AirPods Pro and Apple Vision Pro, combined with a groundbreaking wireless audio protocol, unlocks powerful 20-bit, 48 kHz Lossless Audio with a massive reduction in audio latency.</p></blockquote><p> The change from Lightning to USB-C is obvious. The increased dust-resistance is nice. But the ultra-low latency (single-digit milliseconds, I&#39;m reliably told) lossless audio from Vision Pro is interesting. (And I suspect, will be considered a bit annoying to people who already own AirPods Pro 2 with the Lightning case.)</p><h2> Photography and GPUs</h2><p> On the surface, camera features and GPU specs don&#39;t seem related, but they share one thematic similarity: they&#39;re two areas where Apple is behind the industry state-of-the-art. iPhone cameras aren&#39;t behind the state-of-the-art for <em>phone</em> photography, of course — they&#39;re probably the best, and undeniably among the best. But they&#39;re not the best <em>cameras</em> , period, full stop, in the world. Apple wants them to be, and is pursuing this relentlessly year after year. And while Apple Silicon GPUs are also undeniably market-leading for <em>phones</em> , they&#39;re just as undeniably <em>not</em> market-leading in PCs, where Nvidia reigns supreme. I firmly believe Apple wants to do to Nvidia with GPUs what they did to Intel with CPUs — match or surpass them in pure performance, and utterly blow them away in performance-per-watt.</p><p> On the photography front there were two major new features announced Tuesday. The first is a new generation of portrait photography, where Portrait mode can be applied to an image <em>after</em> it was shot as a regular still image. I&#39;ve wanted this feature ever since Portrait mode debuted. While capturing, you don&#39;t have to do a damn thing. You just frame your photo and hit the shutter. No switching modes. But on-device machine learning will decide on the spot whether Portrait mode can improve the image (which will only happen automatically if the subject is a person, dog, or cat), but you can enable it, disable it, and adjust it to your heart&#39;s content in post.</p><p> The second is the iPhone 15 Pro models&#39; ability to capture spatial video. I had <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111054476354563569">speculated over the summer</a> that it would be cool if Apple could launch this for iPhones this year, and they did it. Clearly the optimal way to <em>watch</em> spatial videos will be with a Vision headset, but the best way to <em>capture</em> them — especially in terms of the old adage that the best camera is the one you have with you — will be with iPhones. I considered it a lock that iPhones would eventually be able to capture spatial video memories, but to me it&#39;s a sign of operational excellence and cross-device collaboration that Apple pulled it off this year, with iPhones that will ship months ahead of the first-generation Vision Pro. (The ability to shoot spatial video using an iPhone 15 Pro isn&#39;t available yet — it&#39;s “coming later this year”. And the hands-on area units didn&#39;t have the feature, nor any example spatial videos preloaded. So the only thing we know about the feature is what was broadcast in the keynote.)</p><p> With regard to the A17 Pro, let&#39;s start with the name. Apple uses “pro” in a lot of different ways for a lot of different products, but one thing they&#39;re pretty consistent about is that “Pro” products are the only ones with “pro” components or features. (Note, for example, that ProMotion dynamic refresh rates are only available in the iPhone Pro, iPad Pro, and MacBook Pro.) So I think Apple has once again tweaked their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/apples_two-pronged_annual_iphone_strategy">two-pronged annual iPhone strategy</a> : I bet next year&#39;s iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will get an A17 SoC, but I will also bet that chip will not be the A17 Pro. Maybe that will be the A17 “Bionic”, maybe just the no-adjective “A17”, but I do not think it will be the A17 Pro that&#39;s shipping in the iPhones 15 Pro.</p><p> What might be different in the non-pro A17 next year? I suspect the GPU might not be as beefy (perhaps, with binning, it will offer 5 cores instead of 6), and I suspect it might have 6 GB of RAM (like the A16 Bionic chips) instead of the 8 GB of RAM in the A17 Pro.</p><p> But my god, what a GPU the A17 Pro seems to have. Hardware-accelerated ray tracing is a huge deal, and a major differentiating factor between Apple&#39;s M-series chips (which don&#39;t have it) and high-end PC GPUs from Nvidia and AMD (which do). Clearly, this new GPU is not just the biggest aspect of the A17 Pro, it&#39;s going to be the biggest aspect of the M3-series chips for Macs and iPads (and, eventually, Vision headsets) too. The A-series chips have always had world-class GPUs for phones, but Apple is attempting to narrow the high-end GPU gap on the PC side as well.</p><p> But when? The A17 Pro is the de facto launch of TSMC&#39;s next-generation 3nm fabrication. Informed speculation suggests that Apple has secured 90-95 percent of TSMC&#39;s 3nm output for the next year, and it sounds like TSMC&#39;s production might not be able to keep up with iPhone 15 Pro demand — the 15 Pro models might wind up backordered for months to come. That&#39;s an aspect of Apple&#39;s two-pronged annual iPhone strategy <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/apples_two-pronged_annual_iphone_strategy">I didn&#39;t mention last week</a> . I don&#39;t think it would have even been possible for the non-pro iPhone 15 models to use the A17 chip because they&#39;re going to have trouble enough producing them for the Pro models alone.</p><p> So based solely on TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability, I don&#39;t expect to see M3 Macs or iPads this year, and perhaps not until midway through <em>next</em> year. Keep in mind too that the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air just launched three months ago. That to me was a sign that the M2 would remain “current” until at least next year. People hoping for new M3 MacBook Airs this year are setting themselves up for disappointment, I think.</p><p> It speaks to the iPhone&#39;s preeminence in Apple&#39;s product lineup — a preeminence based, reasonably, on profound popularity and profitability — that it gets the most cutting-edge silicon long before any other product.</p><h2> Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2</h2><p> The Series 9 watches continue to have their series number etched on the caseback. But the new Ultra doesn&#39;t say “2” on it anywhere. It&#39;s just the new Ultra. I <em>think</em> it&#39;s indistinguishable from last year&#39;s original Apple Watch Ultra on the outside — you&#39;ll need to power the watch on and check in Settings → General → About to tell whether an Ultra is from the first or second generation. Apple almost never labels its products with generation numbers or model years on the outside. But this seems like an inconsistent way to treat the two different lines of Apple Watches. It&#39;s almost enough to make you think that when the Series Apple Watches launched, there was an influential executive who thought numbering them was a good idea, and that executive is no longer at Apple.</p><p> The best new feature in Apple Watch this year has to be the new double tap gesture, enabling no-touch manipulation of the watch. We got to try this in the hands-on area, and it Just Worked™. Fast, accurate, and natural. In the keynote and their marketing materials, Apple says you need to tap your thumb and index finger, but I tried with my thumb and middle finger and it worked just fine. No more touching your nose to your watch when your hands are dirty from food preparation or carrying something you can&#39;t set down. And the double tap gesture parallels the main gesture that will be used to navigate VisionOS. (One question that occurs to me now: What happens when you&#39;re using a Vision Pro while wearing an Apple Watch, and you double tap with your watch hand? Does the gesture apply to both devices? Or do they somehow negotiate with each other and determine which one acts on it? Apple devices already negotiate like this when you utter “Hey Siri” within earshot of multiple devices — I suspect that when using a Vision Pro while wearing a new Apple Watch, the headset will get first crack at a double tap gesture.)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-15"><p> It&#39;s almost certainly true that 2023 will be remembered as the year that AI broke through, and that ChatGPT in particular is the “tech product” of the year.

Two of its biggest challengers, Samsung and Huawei, have stumbled in recent years. Samsung faltered in 2016 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/international/samsung-galaxy-note7-terminated.html">the batteries in its flagship smartphone spontaneously combusted</a> . Huawei, which was popular in China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html">floundered in 2020</a> after the Trump administration blocked it from buying US technology.</p></blockquote><p> Huawei&#39;s geopolitical travails are another matter, but it seems downright silly to attribute even an iota of the iPhone&#39;s popularity in 2023 to one disastrous Samsung model seven years ago — especially given that Samsung has never put all its “flagship phone” eggs in one basket. But imagine now if that had been the iPhone 7 with the exploding batteries and that was ultimately recalled from the market. The news media is drawn to “ <em>Look how the mighty have fallen</em> ” story narratives like moths to an open flame. If it <em>had</em> been the iPhone 7 instead of the Galaxy Note 7 whose batteries combusted, we&#39;d still be hearing about it in every article about today&#39;s iPhones. Nothing like that has happened with an Apple product since the PowerBook 5300 back in 1995, but that doesn&#39;t mean it <em>can&#39;t</em> happen. The pressure to avoid such a debacle with every single battery and power adapter Apple manufactures is intense.

<p>I came away from Tuesday&#39;s keynote with the impression that, like Apple, Hermès would no longer be making leather Apple Watch straps.但事实并非如此。 Apple itself is <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-hermes/">only selling Hermès watches with fabric and rubber straps</a> , but Hermès itself still has 21 leather straps for the Series 9 Hermès watches. Apple&#39;s keynote seemed so adamant about nixing leather that I suspect there are fans of the Hermès leather straps who are disappointed, thinking they&#39;re no longer being produced. But I can see why Apple decided against mentioning it.

<p>There were rampant rumors pre-event that Apple was going to raise the prices for the iPhone Pro models this year, but they didn&#39;t. They did, however, eliminate the 128 GB $1099 iPhone Max model. There&#39;s a 128 GB iPhone 15 Pro for $999, but the entry model Max has 256 GB of storage and costs $1199. That&#39;s $100 higher than last year&#39;s 128 GB 14 Pro Max, but the same price as last year&#39;s 256 GB 14 Pro Max. Turns out, inflation adjusted, this year&#39;s prices are <em>lower</em> , not higher.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inflation-Adjusted iPhone Pricing’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/13/inflation-adjusted-iphone-pricing">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Dithering </title><link href="https://dithering.fm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/13/dithering" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40230</id><published> 2023-09-13T21:50:19Z</published><updated> 2023-09-20T16:02:58Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">the iPhone X</a> marked an obvious inflection point in iPhone history: the switch from the original home-button system interface, with Touch ID, to the “all-screen” interface with Face ID. But it also marked a widely misunderstood/under-appreciated (although, it pains me to point out, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/iphone_x_one_year">not by all</a> ) change in Apple&#39;s annual iPhone hardware strategy. Instead of introducing just one new iPhone, in 2017 Apple began introducing <em>two</em> entirely different tiers of new iPhone each year. One “pro”, one “regular”: </p><!-- Markdown table

The real difference has been between the pro and non-pro models. Apple didn&#39;t start naming iPhones “Pro” until the iPhones 11 in 2019, but effectively, they started this “pro” tier with the X in 2017.</p><p> What everyone groks about this strategy is that the pro models are more expensive. Of course they are. But there are a few aspects to Apple&#39;s strategy that many people miss. The most important is that the iPhone Pro models are only produced for one year. If the pattern holds, come next week, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will cease production, and be <em>replaced</em> in the product line by the new 15 Pro models. The non-pro iPhones, however, stay in production for at least two additional years, dropping in price by $100 each year. I find that fascinating, but it&#39;s seldom remarked upon. The iPhones that are the most expensive, most cutting-edge, and I presume the hardest to manufacture are only produced for one single year. That&#39;s an altogether new strategy from the years before the iPhone X, when there was just one new flagship iPhone per year (albeit in two sizes during the iPhone 6-6S-7 years), and most iPhones stayed in the lineup at reduced prices for years to come.</p><p> So while there have been reports that last year&#39;s iPhone 14 Plus hasn&#39;t sold particularly well, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a failure, or even that Apple expected it to sell all that well <em>this</em> past year. To me, the workhorse years for non-pro iPhones are years two and three in the lineup, when they come down in price. People shopping for less expensive iPhones but who want a big-ass screen have never had an option before: the now-year-old iPhone 14 Plus will be that.</p><p> One much-noted change last year is that the non-pro iPhone 14 models remained on the A15 chip from 2021. One less-noted change is that internally, the iPhone 14 is very different from the iPhone 13, despite the fact that both use the same A15 chip. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">iFixit describes the iPhone 14</a> — the non-pro models — as the most repairable iPhones Apple has ever made. The chip remained the same but the internal design was altogether different, and better. The iPhone 14 is a design that was meant to remain in production for years to come.</p><p> We won&#39;t know tomorrow whether this more repairable, more accessible system architecture will repeat with the iPhone 15, but I suspect it will. No matter what, the regular iPhone 15 models will not simply be the iPhones 14 Pro models repackaged in aluminum frames rather than stainless steel. The strategy Apple has achieved, as I see it:</p><ul><li> Pro models: cutting-edge chips, cameras, and materials; will be produced for just one year.</li><li> Non-pro models: refined architecture using the year-old SoC and older camera systems; will be produced for 2-3 years <em>after</em> their launch year.</li></ul><p> The iPhones Pro are far more exciting, but the non-pro iPhones are essential to the lineup and thus to the entire iPhone ecosystem. In sports terms, the Pro models are the offense, and the non-pro models are the defense. The offense gets the glory, but it&#39;s defense, <a href="https://theconversation.com/does-defense-actually-win-championships-89628">they say</a> , that wins championships.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple&#39;s Two-Pronged Annual iPhone Strategy</title></entry><entry><title> At Least the Word &#39;Maniacal&#39; Fits </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/09/11/elon-musk-moved-twitter-servers-himself-in-the-night-new-biography-details-his-maniacal-sense-of-urgency.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40227</id><published> 2023-09-12T00:47:41Z</published><updated> 2023-09-12T00:47:43Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>CNBC has another excerpt from Walter Isaacson&#39;s <em>Elon Musk</em> , this one telling the tale of Musk and his cousins moving thousands of servers from a data center in Sacramento to another in Portland:</p><blockquote><p> “You&#39;ll have to hire a contractor to lift the floor panels,” Alex said. “They need to be lifted with suction cups.” Another set of contractors, he said, would then have to go underneath the floor panels and disconnect the electric cables and seismic rods.</p><p> Musk turned to his security guard and asked to borrow his pocket knife. Using it, he was able to lift one of the air vents in the floor, which allowed him to pry open the floor panels. He then crawled under the server floor himself, used the knife to jimmy open an electrical cabinet, pulled the server plugs, and waited to see what happened. Nothing exploded. The server was ready to be moved.</p><p> “Well that doesn&#39;t seem super hard,” he said as Alex the Uzbek and the rest of the gang stared. Musk was totally jazzed by this point. It was, he said with a loud laugh, like a remake of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> , Sacramento edition.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s all a bunch of yucks until it turns to yikes:</p><blockquote><p> The servers had user data on them, and James did not initially realize that, for privacy reasons, they were supposed to be wiped clean before being moved. “By the time we learned this, the servers had already been unplugged and rolled out, so there was no way we would roll them back, plug them in, and then wipe them,” he says. Plus, the wiping software wasn&#39;t working. “Fuck, what do we do?” he asked. Elon recommended that they lock the trucks and track them.</p><p> So James sent someone to Home Depot to buy big padlocks, and they sent the combination codes on a spreadsheet to Portland so the trucks could be opened there. “I can&#39;t believe it worked,” James says. “They all made it to Portland safely.”</p></blockquote><p> A profound sense of urgency is beneficial to a leader, up to a point. Despite CNBC&#39;s framing, Musk clearly goes way past that point. This entire endeavor was absurdly and unnecessarily reckless. In addition to the privacy violations, yanking these servers out of Sacramento, against the direct advice of Twitter&#39;s infrastructure team, directly led to months of instability for users.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘At Least the Word ‘Maniacal’ Fits’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Qualcomm Announces Renewed Deal With Apple for 5G Modems </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40226</id><published> 2023-09-11T15:54:05Z</published><updated> 2023-09-11T20:10:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ian King and Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. is extending an agreement to get modem semiconductors from Qualcomm Inc. for three more years, a sign that its ambitious effort to design the chips in-house is taking longer than expected. Qualcomm shares surged on the news.</p><p> The new pact will cover “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026,” Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies&#39; agreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone — due on Tuesday — was expected to be one of the last to rely on the Qualcomm modem chip. […]</p><p> “This agreement reinforces Qualcomm&#39;s track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products,” the San Diego-based chipmaker said. Though the financial terms of the new deal weren&#39;t disclosed, Qualcomm said it was similar to the previous arrangement signed in 2019.</p></blockquote><p> Funny how they announced this today, and even funnier that there&#39;s no quote from anyone at Apple. Qualcomm, seemingly, has Apple over the barrel on these 5G modems.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Keep in mind that Apple has been trying to build its own 5G modems for years now.

<p>Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p> The Indiana Pi Bill is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the Indiana General Assembly, one of the most notorious attempts to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, although it does imply various incorrect values of the mathematical constant π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by a physician who was an amateur mathematician, never became law due to the intervention of Prof. CA Waldo of Purdue University, who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210515024706/http://www.math.purdue.edu/people/bio/egoins/Indiana%20Pi%20Bill.html">Here&#39;s a good summary</a> (from modern day Purdue professor Edray Goins) of how this kook Edwin Goodwin arrived at π = 3.2.</p><p> I was reminded of this laughable legislation <sup>*</sup> by a friend commenting on the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/uk-encryption-win">UK abandoning its foolhardy attempt</a> to mandate the inspection of impossible-to-inspect end-to-end messaging. E2EE communication cannot be “scanned” for child pornography while remaining secure for all other purposes, but it would be nice if it could. Pi is not 3.2 and a circle cannot be squared, but it would nice if it were so. The UK&#39;s legislation is every bit as much ignorant wishful thinking as Indiana&#39;s was over a century ago.</p><p> That Indiana bill was not defeated, however — it was apparently merely shelved. The UK, likewise, has not repealed the law granting them the power to effectively ban end-to-end encryption — they&#39;ve merely declared that they will not use it — yet. That&#39;s dangerous. This law should be rescinded, not ignored.</p><p> <small>* <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/mode/1up">From Waldo&#39;s own account of the saga</a> comes this gem of a quote (written in the third person), regarding an offer to be introduced to Goodwin: “A member then showed the writer a copy of the bill just passed and asked him if he would like an introduction to the learned doctor, its author. He declined the courtesy with thanks remarking that he was acquainted with as many crazy people as he cared to know.”</small><p> Amen, Dr. Waldo.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Indiana Pi Bill’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/indiana-pi-bill">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Twitter/X&#39;s Descent Into an Antisemitic Cesspool </title><link href="https://twitter.com/David_Leavitt/status/1699494318078136786" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/twitter-antisemetic-cesspool" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40221</id><published> 2023-09-06T23:29:17Z</published><updated> 2023-09-07T06:01:53Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

But no, these accounts are <em>welcome</em> on Twitter.</p><p> This has nothing to do with any sort of reasonable criticism of or disagreement with the Anti-Defamation League. This is about a big blinking “Welcome Nazis” neon sign.

<p>Lane Brown, writing for Vulture:</p><blockquote><p> But despite Rotten Tomatoes&#39;s reputed importance, it&#39;s worth a reminder: Its math stinks. Scores are calculated by classifying each review as either positive or negative and then dividing the number of positives by the total. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about">That&#39;s the whole formula</a> . Every review carries the same weight whether it runs in a major newspaper or a Substack with a dozen subscribers.</p><p> If a review straddles positive and negative, too bad. “I read some reviews of my own films where the writer might say that he doesn&#39;t think that I pull something off, but, boy, is it interesting in the way that I don&#39;t pull it off,” says Schrader, a former critic. “To me, that&#39;s a good review, but it would count as negative on Rotten Tomatoes.” [...]</p><p> Another problem — and where the trickery often begins — is that Rotten Tomatoes scores are posted after a movie receives only a handful of reviews, sometimes as few as five, even if those reviews may be an unrepresentative sample. This is sort of like a cable-news network declaring an Election Night winner after a single county reports its results. But studios see it as a feature, since, with a little elbow grease, they can sometimes fool people into believing a movie is better than it is.</p></blockquote><p> Brown also uncovers implicit payola, with a Hollywood PR firm paying small-time critics tracked by Rotten Tomatoes $50 (fifty measly bucks!) for positive reviews. My whole family has been growing ever more skeptical of Rotten Tomatoes scores for years, but we reached a breaking point earlier this year when we rented <em>M3gan</em> , which we all found to be a shitty movie, but <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan">scored a 93 from Rotten Tomatoes</a> . (It has a “generally favorable” <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/m3gan">72 from Metacritic</a> .)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Rotten Tomatoes Is Rotten’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/rotten-tomatoes-is-rotten">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
