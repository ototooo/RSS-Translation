<p>从苹果新闻编辑室档案室，Dateline“旧金山麦克沃尔德博览会 -  2000年1月5日”：</p><blockquote><p>苹果今天将其备受期待的互联网策略推出，引入了一种新的互联网服务，称为Itools。一个完全重新设计的Apple.com网站，其中包含IREVIEW和ICARDS；以及与Earthlink的多年合作伙伴关系和投资，用于互联网访问（请参阅相关版本）。</p><p> Itools是革命性的互联网服务新类别，它利用了Internet两端的苹果公司的独特技术 - 客户端的操作系统（MAC OS 9）和在Apple的Internet服务器（ITOOLS）上运行的服务软件。在Internet两端提供该软件为Apple提供了前所未有的能力，可以提供无法仅在Internet服务器上实施的服务。</p><p>苹果公司Iceo的史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）表示：“我们的新Ireview，Icards和革命性的ITools为Mac用户提供了令人惊叹的新方法，可以充分利用互联网。” “ Mac用户现在可以在Wintel用户只能梦想的互联网上做一些事情。”</p></blockquote><p>事后看来，这令人震惊的是，苹果大约在2000年毫不掩饰地是笨拙的弱者。如果非常高度期待公告，您不必将其描述为“备受期待的”。乔布斯引用了包括口语的“ Wintel”。</p><p>从功能列表中：</p><blockquote><p> Mac.com，由Apple运营的电子邮件服务。 Mac.com在Internet上为用户提供了一个独家地址，并与标准的POP电子邮件客户端一起使用，例如Outlook Express，Eudora和Netscape Communicator。 Mac.com用户可以轻松地设置自动答复，并将其电子邮件转发到其他电子邮件地址，并从简单的网页上为其Mac.com邮箱配置Outlook Express。</p></blockquote><p>因此，我误解了我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">今天早些时候</a>如何进入分叉的Apple帐户情况的时间表（但在那个帖子中我是正确的，以至于不确定时间表）。我的 @Mac.com地址确实早于iTunes音乐商店的首次亮相，但是自2000年1月宣布Itools以来<a href="https://mastodon.mit.edu/@Eggfreckles/113988325606848730">，</a>我已经宣布了Itools，而不是在2002年7月宣布的.mac（最糟糕的苹果名称？）。<a href="https://mastodon.mit.edu/@Eggfreckles/113988325606848730">托马斯（Thomas）品牌</a>提醒我。）品牌发展是：</p><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2000/01/05Apple-Unveils-Internet-Strategy/">itools</a> （2000）→ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/07/17Apple-Launches-Mac/">.mac</a> （2002）→ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/06/09Apple-Introduces-MobileMe-Internet-Service/">Mobileme</a> （2008）→ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/06/06Apple-Introduces-iCloud/">iCloud</a> （2011）</p><p>苹果花了十年的时间才从itools到iCloud，但iCloud被证明是赢家。当今天的“ AI时刻”大约在2000年考虑“互联网时刻”很有趣。大约2000年，热门的新公司没有制作计算机或设备，也没有制作在消费设备上运行的软件。他们制作了网站和网络应用程序，可以在设备上浏览器中运行。</p><p>然后，针对苹果的熊案是，他们错过了大事物上的船，他们的核心优势不再具有意义。现在几乎相同的熊盒：AI。不同之处在于，今天的苹果不仅不是“笨拙的弱者”，而且是世界上最有价值的公司。</p><div> <a  title="从2000年1月起，与苹果原始的“互联网策略”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/itools">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple完成了像素机器人的收购</title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41564</id><published> 2025-02-12T00：48：13Z</published><updated> 2025-02-12T00：48：14Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Angela Watercutter，幕后花絮，探讨了Kendrick Lamar的苹果音乐赞助的半场表演：</p><blockquote><p>当您参加麦当娜音乐会或民主党全国代表大会时，“使它起作用”意味着一件事，但是当您试图将其挤入堪萨斯城酋长与费城老鹰队之间的全国冠军比赛时，这意味着不同的事情。 。首先，您必须在7.5分钟内将所有的舞台，灯光，舞者和艺术家本身都放到田野上，然后在最后的音符后6分钟将它们放下。另一方面，您必须在一年中最大的NFL比赛的领域中完成所有这些工作，而不会搞砸草皮。</p></blockquote><p>赞助这些半场表演的Apple Music似乎是一种持续的关系。亚马逊Prime周四晚上足球，Google的YouTube电视拥有NFL周日的门票套餐（Apple认真竞标，<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4024544/2022/12/21/nfl-sunday-ticket-apple-youtube/">但没有得到</a>）。这使Apple TV+成为一家没有NFL游戏的大型科技公司的最大流媒体平台。赞助超级碗半场表演使NFL与苹果建立了关系。</p><p>苹果似乎很高兴让演出本身以艺术家为中心。这是肯德里克·拉马尔（Kendrick Lamar）的节目，由苹果音乐（Apple Music）介绍，而不是苹果音乐节目的演出，其中包括肯德里克·拉马尔（Kendrick Lamar）。我可能是错的，但我认为旧的百事可乐中场时间节目更为以百事可乐为中心，更专注于奇观而不是Showmanship。有一些小小的抒情调整，但这些调整可能比苹果的人数更多。苹果<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/02/10/super-bowl-kendrick-lamar-drake-beef-explained/78381830007/">让拉马尔（Lamar）做他的事情</a>，尽管他的仇恨目标是德雷克（Drake）的目标，但实际上是苹果公司（Apple）<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDWxagkyZ4g">在WWDC 2015上邀请舞台上邀请他介绍苹果音乐的</a>艺术家。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接与“肯德里克·拉马尔（Kendrick Lamar）超级碗半场表演”背后的“狂野真实故事”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/wired-kendrick-lamar-halftime-show">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2h" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：//1.41561</id><published> 2025-02-11T04：21：47Z</published><updated> 2025-02-11T18：51：06Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">不同并不总是意味着更好。但更好的是一定意味着不同的。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

  /></a></p><p>我立即注意到（当然），我的膝盖即时反应是负面的。<em>太大，太大了，太大了。不喜欢。</em>那很自然。人类演变为被变革所震惊。如果一切看起来都和往常一样，那么一切都可能像往常一样安全。如果某种东西看起来差异很大，那可能是您即将被杀死的标志。 （从进化上讲。）</p><p>因此，我开始研究并<em>考虑</em>Fox得分刺的变化。我不仅很快就加入了新的Scorebug，还决定我<em>真的很</em>喜欢。它比福克斯的旧网络好，比其他每个网络都更好（在几乎每一个方面看起来都一样）。</p><p>我（Cross-）在游戏期间非常喜欢新的Scorebug。我的帖子按参与顺序：<a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl">线程</a>（〜6,600个赞，〜700个回复和重新发布），<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhrvgkwsn22c">蓝调</a>（〜3,900个赞，〜600个回复和转换）和<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113976775382664038">mastodon</a> （179个赞，53个回复和reposts）。</p><p>与更改应用程序的图标相比，应用程序开发人员可以做出的任何更改都不会产生用户更多的评论和情感反馈。每个人都看到了应用程序的图标，并且对它们有意见。经过改变后，这种观点通常是“<em>我喜欢旧的图标，讨厌新的图标。</em>同样，随着游戏广播的得分刺激 - 每个人都看到了它们，并且每个人都会改变时都有意见。对福克斯的新得分捕食的大多数反应都是负面的，其中许多反应<em>确实</em>是负面的。 Yahoo Sports在标题“ <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/super-bowl-fox-sports-debuts-new-scorebug-to-universally-negative-reaction-235225162.html">超级碗：Fox Sports首次亮相新的Scorebug，普遍负面反应</a>”的标题下播放了一个故事。以体育媒体为中心的网站糟糕地宣布了德鲁·勒纳（Drew Lerner）在标题下的“ <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/why-networks-debut-new-scorebugs-during-super-bowl.html">请在超级碗期间首次亮相新的得分俱乐部</a>”（副标题：“我不能只看一个超级碗而不必学习新图形吗？” ）。我什至没有接近阅读我社交媒体的所有答复（嗯，除了在Mastodon上 - 很快就可以赶上那里），但是如果您仔细阅读它们，您会很快看到大多数答复来自鄙视变化的人。代表品尝：</p><p> “<em>看起来好像他们只是让实习生在PowerPoint中敲一些东西，而没有打扰有人先检查一下。可怕。</em> 👎”</p><p> “<em>哈哈。因成为笨蛋而被静音。</em>透明</p><p>“<em>它很丑陋，其霸道的尺寸分散了游戏的实际内容。</em>透明</p><p>“<em>得分戒指绝对可怕！我真的希望他们不会在2025赛季采用这种情况，否则我会骚乱。可怕的设计，特别是分散注意力的乐谱，这看起来像是Fortnite的东西。</em>透明</p><p>“看起来像是Fortnite的东西”并不是最后的评论者认为这是的。很多人玩耍和爱Fortnite。</p><p>这是一个扩展的（从我发布的内容到社交媒体），我喜欢新的Scorebug，也许甚至是爱。首先，主要项目：谁在玩游戏，得分是什么：</p><ul><li><em>团队初始主义</em>：巨大。</li><li><em>团队徽标</em>：无。颜色足够说。</li><li><em>得分</em>：巨大。</li><li><em>游戏时钟</em>：足够大且居中。</li><li><em>不必要的铬</em>：无。</li></ul><p>球迷们以2个或3个字母的缩写对联盟中的每个团队都熟悉，就像机场代码或股票股票一样。它们都是显而易见的（ <a href="https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/44258497/15-weird-airport-codes-and-how-they-came-to-be/">与许多机场代码不同</a>）。达拉斯牛仔队是达尔。新英格兰爱国者是东北。对于拥有纽约和洛杉矶两个团队的两个城市，这些城市便利地缩写为两个字母，并从团队的昵称中汲取了第三个字母：巨人和喷气机是NYG和NYJ；公羊和充电器是lar和lac。</p><p>团队徽标并不能立即识别，尤其是在小尺寸的情况下。一群团队有愤怒的鸟摩托车：鹰，海鹰，猎鹰和红衣主教。您还记得田纳西泰坦的徽标吗？还是休斯顿德克萨斯人？克利夫兰布朗甚至没有徽标可以说。 （而且它们也不是棕色。）但是我保证您知道哪些球队是十，侯和CLE。 <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-10">3</a></sup></p><p>而且，重要的是，这些团队的初始主义并非仅由排版来代表：它们在带有团队的主要色彩的盒子里。与团队徽标相比，这种颜色的使用可实现所有品牌的工作，并以远距离的尺寸或从远距离查看更有效地做到这一点。 （我拥有的一个小麻烦是团队的初始主义是大白色的字母，但由团队的次要颜色概述。如果您仔细观察上面昨天的超级碗的屏幕截图，您会发现“ KC”在黄色上概述了“ phi”在白银中，在正常的观看距离上，使初始主义看起来有些模糊。使文字在屏幕上呈现不佳的效果。</p><p>消除所有不必要的镀铬可以说是最引人注目的变化，因为福克斯的旧得分捕食最多具有最多的“ 3D”样式和纹理。本身本身不是极简主义，但这是反对不必要的装饰的罢工 - 让我想起了乔尼·艾夫（Jony Ive）十年前7月7日的iOS重新设计。单独通过类型和颜色传达的元素仅通过类型和颜色<em>表示</em>。</p><p>其他值得注意的功能：</p><ul><li><p><em>剩下的超时</em>：突出但不会分散注意力。看到一支球队剩下的超时是福克斯的旧得分捕食和大多数其他网络当前的得分cugs的巨大问题。 （在近距离足球比赛中剩下的超时非常重要。）</p></li><li><p><em>当前的下降和码来指示指标（例如“ 1st＆10”）</em> ：在团队初始主义顶部的位置传达了哪个球队拥有球。福克斯（Fox）的旧得分俱乐部确实有一个“拥有”指标，但是滚动回头查看它，看看您需要多长时间才能弄清楚它是什么。我将答案放在脚注中。 <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-10"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-10">4</a></sup></p></li><li><p><em>排版</em>：经典，清晰，大胆，永恒。它也非常“狐狸”  - “ kc”中的c在经典的“福克斯”文字中看起来像o，而零（数字酋长球迷一直非常熟悉到第三季度的最后一秒钟，因为这就是方式直到那时，他们得分的许多积分 - 老鹰队在以34-0领先的途中骑自行车骑行了一堆不同的数字）几乎就像“福克斯”中的大写O。</p></li></ul><p>更大，更大胆的版式增加了清晰度。但是，删除背景镀铬使观众可以“浏览”到屏幕底部发生的任何游戏动作。对我来说，只有一场比赛，旧的福克斯得分布格看上去毫无希望地过时了。老式没有任何怀旧魅力。如果有的话，新的排版优先设计是看起来永恒的设计，对经典NFL电影制作中的图形令人回味。</p><hr /><p>这是什么。 NFL广播并不总是有分数。我并不是说他们在屏幕上的得分指标较小。我的意思是他们根本没有。对于电视上的所有主要运动，不仅仅是足球比赛（例如，<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1RsKKjDLU">摩天比利斯<em>（Ferris Bueller）休息日</em>的插科打of</a> ）都是如此。直到1994年，这些网络将显示出削减商业休息时的分数和时间，然后在广告中回来时再次展示。但是，在比赛中，屏幕上没有得分。其中的一部分是技术：游戏电视转播是从房间各地看到的相对较小的电视屏幕的低空透射。回去足够远，甚至没有颜色。但是更大的方面是惯性。始终没有显示分数的方式是游戏总是广播的方式，所以这是他们仍然被广播的方式。</p><p>然后是福克斯。</p><p>几十年来，美国有三个主要的电视网络：ABC，NBC和CBS。哥伦比亚广播公司拥有高级国家橄榄球会议的周日比赛权利。 “高级”出于团队知名度<em>和</em><a href="https://nflschedules.com/nfl-markets/">团队市场规模</a>的相关原因，这对于评分很重要。芝加哥，费城，华盛顿，达拉斯，弗里斯科。 NBC拥有来自通常较小城市的球队的美国足球会议的周日比赛权利。堪萨斯城匹兹堡，迈阿密。好的团队，但是小城市。 （不过，在1993年，NFC球队连续9次赢得了9个超级碗。）</p><p>鲁珀特·默多克（Rupert Murdoch）的福克斯网络（Fox Network）试图建立第四个美国网络，很快就经历了足够的成功。在1987年首次亮相时，福克斯（Fox）在一周的一个晚上（周日，方便）只有黄金时段编程。 1993年，默多克和福克斯（Murdoch）和福克斯（Fox）通过超越（愚蠢的，紧身，狂热，狂热）的哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）宣传体育广播的世界，以便在周日播放NFC游戏的权利。</p><p> 2018年，布莱恩·柯蒂斯（Bryan Curtis）在林格（Ringer）出版了该交易的全面口述历史及其后果：“ <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/13/nfl/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc">伟大的NFL抢劫：福克斯如何为足球付出和改变足球</a>”。如果您完全感兴趣，请阅读。讲得很好，这是一个很棒的故事。</p><p>但是在1994年，福克斯接管了NFC广播。他们从哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）偷猎了所有播音员，摄影师，导演和制片人。 （CBS不再需要它们，因为他们没有足球比赛可以广播。）但是，宣布该游戏的声音很熟悉（包括<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lhw2h44zss2s">有史以来最好的二人组</a>：John Madden和Pat Summerall），但外观和感觉广播有意新鲜，新鲜，而且因为是福克斯（Fox），布拉什（Brash）。这包括他们称为“狐狸盒”的创新。引用柯蒂斯在铃声中的口述历史：</p><blockquote><p><em>戴维·希尔（David Hill）关于NFL的最具争议的想法是他最简单的：他认为分数和时钟应该在屏幕上有一个永久的房屋 - 该功能被称为“狐狸盒”。一群嘈杂的批评家和竞争对手的高管认为狐狸盒是一个可怕的主意。它会使屏幕混乱，并使人们摆脱井喷。但是希尔被说服了，因为他在一个令人沮丧的下午看着英国的足球后创建了一个原始的福克斯盒子</em></p><p><strong>希尔：</strong>我们一直在walking狗。我们会进来，喝一杯茶，然后打开BBC。我看了15分钟的比赛。我不知道分数是多少。我对自己想：“该死，我真的很想知道分数是多少。”所以我想：“这很容易。在chyron上，我只是把它放在拐角处。”所以我做到了。</p><p> <strong>Madden：</strong>没有说：“不，这是一个愚蠢的主意，我们还有其他事情要做，”他说，“如果分数和时间是最重要的事情，我们为什么不把它放起来，然后留在那里吗？”那是狐狸盒的来源。那是大卫·希尔。</p><p><strong>多尔金：</strong>所有网络都告诉我们：“您正在搞砸。你是白痴要这样做。”</p><p><strong>阿尔伯特（Albert）：</strong>这个想法是，有些网络不会离开时间并得分，因为这是一场井喷，他们不希望您<em>知道</em>这是一场井喷。</p></blockquote><p> “福克斯盒”的想法不仅有争议，而且被广泛愚蠢。网络从字面上认为，如果许多观众不知道分数会更好。当狐狸盒出现时，许多批评家都同意。这是<a href="https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/nfl-on-fox-2-1200438717/">丹·考克斯（Dan Cox）在1994年9月对福克斯（Fox）开幕周广播的评论</a>：</p><blockquote><p>该网络还坚持在几乎整个游戏中，在屏幕左上角都在屏幕上左上角的那个烦人的透明时钟和得分图形。 Fox Sports Prexy David Hill表示，重要的是要知道得分以及坐下来坐下时还剩多少时间。</p><p>好吧，是的。但是，那些实际观看游戏开始并宁愿让屏幕远离图形的人怎么样。</p></blockquote><p>谁现在看起来很愚蠢？ Imagine the outcry if Fox had broadcast yesterday&#39;s Super Bowl without any scorebug at all — you know, for those who would rather have their screen clear of graphics.</p><p> Change of any sort is always going to raise alarm, whether it&#39;s actually better or not. When smoking bans started going into effect in cities 30 years ago, people loudly claimed that it would put restaurants and especially bars out of business. Smokers want to smoke and would stay home if they couldn&#39;t, the argument went. Turns out, if you force smokers to go outside in the cold or even rain to smoke, they&#39;ll do it. And a lot of other people — who had been staying home because they despised the stench of cigarettes — started going out more often. In hindsight banning cigarettes from shared public spaces (airplanes, for chrissake!) was obviously the correct decision. But change is hard to accept, no matter how obviously for the better.</p><p> I say Fox&#39;s new scorebug is better, and raised a ruckus only because it&#39;s <em>so much</em> better that what most viewers noticed is only that it&#39;s so different. When you get used to it, you&#39;ll see. This new design, with bigger bolder type but less needless chrome, pulls off the remarkable feat of conveying key information with more clarity both on the biggest of big screens — TVs in public spaces like bars and restaurants, which are viewed from a distance — <em>and</em> the smallest of small screens, our phones.</p><p> Different doesn&#39;t always mean better. But better necessarily implies different.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-10"><p> You know how when you&#39;re watching most TV channels — not just sports, but any sort of show at all — they keep a logo for the channel in one of the corners of the screen?

<p>Well, the Philadelphia Eagles, of course, won the actual Super Bowl, winning in a romp so one-sided that they would have embarrassed the Chiefs <em>less</em> if they had pantsed Patrick Mahomes at the 50-yard line. But the second contest is for best commercial. And my vote goes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">to Nike</a> .</p><p> The problem with modern Super Bowl commercials is they&#39;re bland. Offensively bland. It really makes no sense to me. The commercial time is famously expensive — Fox was supposedly selling 30-second spots for last night&#39;s game for $8 million — but the sponsors who buy that time tend to squander it with absolute mindless pap.</p><p>每年赞助商越来越少，似乎试图带来一些有趣的东西。不同的东西。 Something with some punch. Something that&#39;s <em>actually</em> funny. Something that makes you actually <em>feel</em> . You don&#39;t have to make a genuinely artistic short film, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I">Apple&#39;s Ridley-Scott-directed <em>1984</em> spot</a> heralding the introduction of the Macintosh — the ad that is justifiably regarded as the best commercial ever made. Some of what I&#39;d list among the best Super Bowl ads ever were silly gimmicks that revelled in their abject silliness, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Bowl">the “Bud Bowl” commercials</a> (featuring anthropomorphic bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light playing football) — very far from “high art” but very fun, and created specifically to be shown once and only once, in the context of the Super Bowl. One simple measure is whether the ads are memorable. Most of the ads in last night&#39;s game I forgot by the time the game resumed after the break.</p><p> I don&#39;t know why anyone would book and commission a Super Bowl commercial if they weren&#39;t trying to <em>do</em> something or <em>say</em> something memorable with the spot. Still, though, there are always at least a handful of standouts.</p><p> My favorite yesterday was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ezn5pZE7o">Nike&#39;s “So Win” spot</a> , a heralding of its own — not for a new Nike product, but for the explosion in interest in women&#39;s sports, featuring WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark and a few other top women&#39;s athletes. Gorgeous black and white cinematography. Led Zeppelin&#39;s rollicking “ <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/whole-lotta-love/580708374?i=580708471">Whole Lotta Love</a> ” as the soundtrack. And a righteous manifesto of a message, delivered with pitch-perfect gusto by narrator Doechii. Nike, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/nikes-super-bowl-ad-puts-women-athletes-center-stage-on-a-male-dominated-field/">it turns out</a> , hadn&#39;t run a Super Bowl ad since 1998, and they came back with a banger that to me reinvigorated the Nike brand. They&#39;ve been in <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/20/former-nike-ceo-john-donahoe-leadership-lessons-choosing-ceo/">a bit of a free fall</a> and I think this ad was intended as much to inspire Nike employees as it was to female athletes and sports fans. (Shades of Apple&#39;s “Think Different” campaign.) I&#39;ve re-watched this spot a few times while writing this post and I like it more each time.</p><p> Honorable mentions:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/608476/openai-super-bowl-chatgpt-commercial">ChatGPT&#39;s branding spot</a> , positioning AI alongside historical breakthroughs in technology. Loved it. I think it was supposed to be a mystery until the very end of the 60-second spot who the ad was for and what exactly it was about, but I guessed “ChatGPT” about 5 seconds in. I kind of hate making a third comparison to an old Apple ad, but ChatGPT&#39;s spot does evoke — not as a rip-off, but homage — the 90-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAEPqUtra6E">“There are a thousand no&#39;s for every yes” opening film from WWDC 2013</a> , perhaps the nadir of Apple&#39;s post-Steve-Jobs grief.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoeGC-eL4I">斯特拉·阿托伊斯（Stella Artois</a> ）：戴维·贝克汉姆（David Beckham）得知他有一个双胞胎兄弟，名为其他戴维·贝克汉姆（David Beckham），他的父母在美国出生时遗弃了他。 Beckham sets off to meet him. Don&#39;t read anything more about it, just watch. Good kicker at the end, too.</li></ul><p> Dishonorable mention:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi</a> is a streaming platform owned by Fox. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Apparently</a> it&#39;s existed since 2014 and has been owned by Fox since 2020, but I&#39;d forgotten it existed until this week, when it was in the news as the streaming platform carrying the Super Bowl. Fox ran a couple of house ads, intended to promote Tubi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMDrZDhxWBs">about a young man born with a head shaped like a cowboy hat</a> . Memorable, yes, but the execution was revolting, not funny. The message I took was that Tubi is the streaming app that will make you feel grossed out.</li></ul> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Nike&#39;s &#39;So Win&#39; Won the Super Bowl</title></entry><entry><link href="https://go.clerk.com/2n40MWr" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2f" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/02/clerk_--_complete_user_managem" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41559</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-02-10T22:04:37Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T22:04:38Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Zara Stone, reporting for The Standard:</p><blockquote><p> “There&#39;s a renaissance happening now in Aaron Swartz-land,” said Lisa Rein, the co-founder of Creative Commons, a nonprofit devoted to expanding public access to information. She founded Aaron Swartz Day in 2013, an annual hackathon and tribute held on his birthday.现在，巴西有一个亚伦·斯瓦茨学院（Aaron Swartz Institute），是一部纪录片，多个书籍和播客 - 甚至是亚伦·斯瓦茨（Aaron Swartz）的纪念品（她警告说，“不要买”）。</p></blockquote><p>我知道亚伦会笑。</p><blockquote><p> Twitch的前首席执行官，Y Combinator的合伙人Emmett Shear是个人认识Swartz的少数人之一。 “我很高兴他成为一个象征，他会赞成这一点，”他分享道，声音有些破裂。 “我真的很想念他。”</p></blockquote><p>我也想念他。男人。但是我发现奇怪的是，活动中只有“很少有认识他的人”。这么多人认识他。这就是使亚伦·<em>亚伦</em>（Aaron Aaron）的一部分 - 他知道互联网上的每个人都很有趣。</p><p> I&#39;m not so sure, either, that he&#39;d approve of all this, his status as a symbol to a generation who never knew him, only of him.

<p>Jason Snell, in a column for Macworld back in November ( <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/the-app-store-era-must-end-and-the-mac-is-the-model/">same column at Six Colors</a> , for members):</p><blockquote><p>这是一个重要的时刻。 Apple has built two separate models for running software on our devices. In one, there&#39;s a gradient of trustworthiness that strongly encourages users to stick to the safe, well-lit paths–but allows competitors to go their own way and users to make different decisions than Apple would prefer they make. And, yes, at the extremes, users can behave in ways that might open them up to danger, but only after many warnings.这是一个非常好的系统。苹果以这种方式构建了它，因为它关心Mac，Mac生态系统和MAC用户。</p><p>当然，另一个模型是我们从iOS中熟悉的模型：只有一层，苹果完全控制它。即使我们花了数千美元来<em>拥有</em>可以运行来自世界各地聪明人开发的软件的设备，但苹果认为，只有它才能确定允许哪种应用程序，应该始终将其切入关于这些应用程序内部每项金融交易的收入，并且如果它不喜欢开发人员的应用程序，它可能要求将其更改或应用程序消失遗忘。</p><p>老实说，这两种方法都来自同一公司……有点惊人。 [...]我知道哪种Apple构建的方法应该是计算设备软件未来的模型。好消息是苹果已经建立了它。自上而下控制我们设备的时代需要结束。 The Mac is the model.</p></blockquote><p>自从他写它以来，我一直在渴望链接到这一点，但是我在写一些漫长的东西或只是链接到它的渴望之间被撕裂了，并使我的评论简短。简而言之，现在是。我认为斯内尔没有错。我知道很多 - 也许最多？ - 您读这本书与他一致。 I&#39;m quite certain that if iOS shifted to Mac-style rules for software distribution, I personally would enjoy it with zero downsides — I&#39;d gain access to software previously unavailable from the App Store (we could make <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/06/19/kotoba">Kotoba</a> a simple download, for example), new software that never existed in the first place due to App Store rules would spring into existence, and I&#39;m quite confident I&#39;d personally never once be tricked or fooled into installing even a single piece of software I&#39;d later come to regret.因此，如果苹果曾经遵循斯内尔的建议 - 无论是通过库比蒂诺的想法，还是在政府法规的象征性枪击位上被嘲笑 - 我个人会为此感到更加满意。你也可能会。</p><p>但是我认为苹果不<em>应该</em>这样做，因为我认为iPhone用户中有数千万千万（也许是数亿美元）将安装安装应用程序后，他们会后悔安装。我的更新，更长的时间必须等待，但是目前，我将您的注意力转移到以前至少对此方面的关注：</p><ul><li> 2021年6月：“<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">注释苹果的反饰面白皮书</a>”</li><li> November 2021: “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/11/federighi_sideloading_keynote_at_web_summit">Craig Federighi&#39;s Sideloading Keynote at Web Summit</a> ”</li><li> 2024年1月：“ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement">要掌握苹果公司对第三方iOS应用程序委托的看似不可动摇的权利</a>”</li></ul><div> <a  title="永久链接到“杰森·斯内尔（Jason Snell）去那里，呼吁iOS遵循Mac模型进行软件分发”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/snell-ios-direct-installation-of-apps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “来自公司笔记本电脑的洪流不正确” </title><link href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w2a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/meta-torrented-books-ai-training-lawsuit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41554</id><published> 2025-02-08T17:56:50Z</published><updated> 2025-02-08T23：15：33Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ashley Belanger，《 ARS Technica报道了作者团体诉讼的新细节》，指控Meta在一批盗版书籍上培训了其AI模型：</p><blockquote><p> Last month, Meta admitted to torrenting a controversial large dataset known as LibGen, which includes tens of millions of pirated books.但是，直到昨天，洪流的细节都是模糊的，直到梅塔未编辑的电子邮件首次公开。 <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Relief-2-5-25.pdf">作者法院申请</a>说，新的证据表明，元倾斜的“至少有81.7台通过网站安娜的档案馆跨多个阴影库的数据，其中包括Z-library和Libgen的数据至少35.7 TB的数据。”和“ Meta先前还倾斜了80.6 TB的Libgen数据。”</p><p>据说，梅塔（Meta）试图通过不使用Facebook服务器来掩盖种子，同时下载数据集以“避免”任何“从Facebook服务器中追溯播种机/下载器”的“风险”，而元研究人员Frank Zhang的<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">内部消息</a>说，将工作描述为处于“隐形模式”。一位负责项目管理项目管理的元主管迈克尔·克拉克（Michael Clark）在<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">证词</a>中说，据称据称，据称发生了修改的设置，“这样可能发生最小的种子”。</p><p>既然新信息已经曝光了，作者声称，参与洪流利比根决定的元人员必须再次被撤销，因为据称新事实“与先前的证词相矛盾”。例如，马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）声称没有参与使用利比根（Libgen）培训AI模型的决策。作者称，但未编辑的消息显示，“先前升级为MZ”之后的“决定使用Libgen的决定”。</p></blockquote><p>无论您对公共数据的AI培训的感觉如何，您都必须成为狂热的人，不要承认很多东西都属于灰色区域。洪流的81个盗版书籍不在灰色区域。想象扎克伯格（Zuckerberg）可以让所有这些书籍都可以，这真是太好笑了。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接与“公司笔记本电脑的洪流不正确”的链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/meta-torrented-books-ai-training-lawsuit">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/my_2024_apple_report_card" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w29" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41553</id><published> 2025-02-07T23:28:06Z</published><updated> 2025-02-10T20:21:32Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> While there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent excellence in 2024, I can&#39;t think of a single area where Apple levelled up.

<p>This week Jason Snell published his annual <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/" title="Six Colors: “Apple in 2024: The Six Colors report card”">Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2024</a> . As I&#39;ve done in the past — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/my_2023_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball: “My 2023 Apple Report Card”">2023</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/my_2022_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2022 Apple Report Card”">2022</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/my_2021_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2021 Apple Report Card”">2021</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/01/my_2020_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2020 Apple Report Card”">2020</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/02/my_2019_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2019 Apple Report Card”">2019</a> , <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card" title="Daring Fireball “My 2018 Apple Report Card”">2018</a> — I&#39;m publishing my full remarks and grades here. On Snell&#39;s report card, voters give per-category scores ranging from 5 to 1; I&#39;ve translated these to letter grades, A to F, which is how I consider them. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-07">1</a></sup></p><p> Most of my grades are unchanged from a year ago. For those that have changed, I&#39;ve noted last year&#39;s grade in parentheses. I didn&#39;t realize this as I was writing my report card, but each of my grades that changed from last year was <em>lower</em> . Not one grade went up.考虑到这一点，当我今天写这序言时，感觉很正确：苹果在2024年保持一致的卓越表现，但我想不出一个苹果升级的单个领域。 Not one. That feels like a problem. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-07"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-07">2</a></sup></p><p> It&#39;s also worth noting that “Siri” is not a standalone category in the report card. We graders simply comment on it as one aspect within other categories and products, like HomePod or Apple Music. Historically that made sense — when it <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/10/04Apple-Launches-iPhone-4S-iOS-5-iCloud/">started</a> , Siri was just a flashy new feature of iOS 5. At this point, though, I think “Siri/Apple Intelligence” clearly deserves to be considered as a category unto itself. One way to think about it: anything that comprises the entire domain of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">senior Apple executive</a> probably ought to be its own category on the report card. For Siri and Apple Intelligence, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a> .另一方面：苹果自己<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=apple+intelligence+commercials">对苹果情报的繁重营销</a>表明，他们自己认为这是公司的类别级别。 I&#39;ve suggested this to Snell, and he&#39;s considering adding it as a proper category next year. (And, unsurprisingly, given his own <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2024/11/where-will-apple-intelligence-go-next/">sharp writing on the subject</a> , he was already thinking about it before I pinged him.)</p><p> If “Siri/Apple Intelligence” <em>were</em> a category for this report card, I&#39;d have graded it a D — and much closer to an F than a C. Longstanding Siri features have not only <em>not</em> gotten better, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">they&#39;ve seemingly gotten worse</a> 。 Apple is simply not a relevant player in the explosively popular LLM game. The features under the “Apple Intelligence” umbrella mostly feel like Apple shipped them a full year ahead of readiness simply because the rest of the industry — and Wall Street — is way ahead of them, and they felt the need to ship what they had,准备好了没。 There are a lot of obviously useful potential AI-powered features — ones that integrate between apps, and/or use your personal data on-device — that, thanks to the tightly restricted sandboxing system Apple itself designed for iOS, only Apple itself can provide via AI. It doesn&#39;t matter that Apple doesn&#39;t offer, say, its own web search engine, because Safari can use whatever search engine <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/kagi">you want</a> . It <em>does</em> matter that Siri sucks because only Siri can tightly integrate at the system level with your device, and with your private cross-application data. The saving grace — what kept me from giving this if-it-were-a-category category an F — is that a few of Apple&#39;s ML/AI features are actually pretty great. Image search in Photos is excellent, downright amazing at times. The new Clean Up generative AI object/person removal tool in Photos is very good — both technically, and in terms of striking an opinionated balance regarding the nature of photography itself. Private Cloud Compute is a tremendously ambitious initiative — but we haven&#39;t seen much fruit from it yet.</p><h2> Mac: A</h2><p> The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years. Even better, both now seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. Personally I am especially pleased, borderline ecstatic, regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150 extra. (They don&#39;t even charge more for the option on the 16-models than 14-inch.)</p><p> The only hitch in the lineup are the Macs Apple <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111835">remain</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111343">unchanged</a> since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC&#39;s first-generation 3nm process, and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC.</p><p> MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release.可靠和熟悉。 Apple Intelligence features that I largely don&#39;t use (or at least don&#39;t use much <em>yet</em> ) are easily ignored and do not get in the way of what is tried and true about, by far, the greatest computing platform the world has ever看到。</p><h2> iPhone: A</h2><p> If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.关于iPhone阵容，什么都没有破坏，苹果没有试图修复任何东西。这很好。 Changes for the sake of change are the surest sign of a company in decline. Stagnation and hubris are concerns for any wildly successful product, but it takes confidence to let great design speak for itself without making facile unnecessary changes.</p><p> Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I&#39;d like to see the actual button improve (I think it&#39;s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Also: kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models.</p><p> iOS 18 is refined, mature, and familiar.</p><h2> iPad: C</h2><p> The iPad hardware story is excellent. iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac, and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. (Please, Apple: bring nano-texture to the iPhone. Take my money.) The iPad Air got a fine update to the M2 chip in May. iPad Mini自2021年以来获得了首次更新，因此<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/transcript-phil-schiller-craig-federighi-and-john-ternus-on-the-state-of-apples-pro-macs/">继续成为Apple阵容中的产品</a>。</p><p> But iPadOS still strikes me like the no-man&#39;s-land platform: nowhere near as capable productivity-wise as a Mac; nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months. I find myself noticeably more productive for it.对我来说，试图在iPad上工作，继续想在戴手套时试图进行手术。</p><h2>总体可穿戴设备：b</h2><p> AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update. AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements this year — most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods continue to exemplify Apple at its best.</p><h2> Apple Watch：C（去年：B）</h2><p> Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn&#39;t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/faces-and-features-apde9218b440/watchos">Flux and Reflections</a> . Setting aside the fact that I personally don&#39;t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11 offers, by my quick count, at least 33 different watch faces that offer a non-digital seconds hand or indicator. And only 2 of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate?那是胡扯。 And it wasn&#39;t just a launch thing, because here we are in February, with WatchOS 11.3, and zero additional watch faces have been updated to support it.这不是认真的制表师如何对待手表。 I will admit to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch">caring far more about always-on seconds hands than most people</a> , but this isn&#39;t how a serious watchmaker deals with technical breakthroughs like this new display with a 1Hz refresh rate. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch正在将更多的健身追踪器变成恰好显示时间的健身追踪器，并且无法用作适当的手表。</p><p> Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that&#39;s it. Kind of weird for a watch that starts at $800 — and that seems quite popular — to skip a year of silicon improvements.</p><h2> Vision Pro: B (last year: N/A)</h2><p> Is it a hit?不，远离它。 But I remain <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/vision_pro_bites_dog">unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope</a> that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it&#39;s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today&#39;s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the primary impetus for John Sculley and Apple&#39;s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company. Many pundits of the era confidently proclaimed that the entire concept of a GUI was a gimmick with no future.</p><p>我是否预测，视觉平台将像1984年的Macintosh一样明亮而必不可少的未来？ No. But I suspect it has <em>a</em> bright and essential future ahead of it.整个概念和范式是如此新颖和不同，以至于像Macintosh 40年前一样，该产品必须以吸引大众市场的价格制作版本的几年，并且在有很多事情要做之前几年使用它。</p><p> But, as it stands, Vision Pro today offers an incredible experience for watching traditional movies and shows, and a breakthrough experience for watching spatial content. If Bang &amp; Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price.空间计算对我来说很有趣，但效率不高。 That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro&#39;s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118521">Mac Virtual Display</a> feature is a highly-productive environment for work.</p><p> I can&#39;t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A&#39;s in future years.</p><h2> Home: D (last year: C)</h2><p> I can&#39;t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something.</p><h2> Apple TV: C (last year: B)</h2><p> I&#39;m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024?任何事物？ It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we&#39;re grading what happened在2024年。</p><p> Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. The current one is their best yet, but it has obvious flaws.</p><h2> Services: B</h2><p> TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I&#39;d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: <em>Wolfs</em> should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+&#39;s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: <em>Slow Horses</em> had another crackerjack season, <em>For All Mankind</em> finished a good fourth season, and new shows like <em>Dark Matter</em> , <em>Bad Monkey</em> , and <em>Presumed Innocent</em> were all strong. TV+ is also a great streaming platform for young kids.</p><p> iCloud, especially with iCloud Plus, remains secure, fast, and reliable. It enables so much seamless continuity (hence Apple&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a> ” umbrella brand for those features) across devices.</p><p>但是我们又在这里再次，我重复了过去几年的同样的痛苦：苹果仍然在免费层中提供仅5 GB的存储空间，并且自从Forever Forever Forewange Wefters nat flanganged sward sote。 I crap bigger than 5 GB.我想知道那里有多少千亿iPhone用户没有设备备份，因为他们只有一个带有5 GB的iCloud帐户？ Apple One Bundle是一笔不错的选择，但是免费的iCloud Tier应该对备份现代iPhone确实有用。 And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do.</p><h2> Hardware Reliability: A</h2><p> No news remains great news in this category.</p><h2> Apple OS Quality: B<br/> Apple Apps: B</h2><p> Unchanged comment, and grade, from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple&#39;s software <em>design</em> is headed (or in some ways, has been now for years), but their software <em>reliability</em> has been very good for me.</p><p> One odd trend: several of Apple&#39;s newest apps, like Journal and Sports (and now, though outside the temporal boundary for a 2024 report card, Invites) are only available for iPhone. Not even iOS, including iPhone and iPad. Just iPhone. Journal in particular belongs on iPadOS and MacOS, too, where people have hardware keyboards for writing.</p><h2> Developer Relations: D (last year: C)</h2><p> Fourth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple&#39;s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple&#39;s platforms. The opposite is happening.</p><p>今年全球的重大变化是《数字市场法》在欧盟生效。 I stand apart from many in the Cupertino punditry racket in applauding Apple for their compliance efforts.我认为他们尽力而为地遵守了一项可怕的法律，同时保护自己的平台应如何设计和工作。 (And, of course, protecting their own vision for how Apple should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can&#39;t and won&#39;t argue that any of Apple&#39;s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers.</p><p> Despite the situation being largely unchanged, I&#39;ve adjusted my grade on this subject from C to D this year, because stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse.而且我认为我们看到了本地应用程序对Vision Pro的相对缺乏。 There&#39;s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- <em>and</em> third-party apps and games.</p><p> With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform.去年对Visionos来说，这种热情受到了极大的调整，我认为这比开发人员对Apple和App Store的感觉更多，而不是他们对Vision Pro本身的感觉。</p><h2> Social and Societal Impact: B (last year: A)</h2><p> Snell&#39;s prompt for this category states, “Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple&#39;s work force, and other political and policy stances.” Apple&#39;s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary. Their accessibility features are so far ahead of the rest of the industry that I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s in second place. On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple&#39;s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now恰好正确。</p><p> If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade. But: politics. I understand (I think) Tim Cook&#39;s thinking and approach. I wouldn&#39;t want his job, and genuinely wonder at times who would. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">Sing-song congratulatory tweets</a> leave a bitter taste, but I&#39;m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they&#39;ve been dealt, not the cards they&#39;d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don&#39;t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can&#39;t donate $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/the-great-american-tradition">a mere $43,200 to Biden&#39;s</a> and expect us to do anything but laugh at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration">the supposed justification</a> that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That&#39;s Tim Cook&#39;s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it&#39;s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it.</p><p> I genuinely believe Cook is doing what&#39;s best for Apple, and that&#39;s quite literally his job. But it was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/cook_trump_campaign_ad">true during the first Trump administration</a> , and already is again in the second, that what&#39;s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what&#39;s best for the country and for the world.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-07"><p> In my previous report cards I&#39;ve described my scale as A to E (A = 5 ...

As I wrote just over a month ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/31/">in my final post of the year</a> , I would argue with anyone that the average quality of an Apple TV+ original show is higher than that for any other streaming platform.

And it&#39;s not like Apple is cash-starved and diverting limited resources to entertainment production budgets at the expense of product development or R&amp;D. Apple, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, can act a bit like a conglomerate without losing focus on its core business of making the world&#39;s best computers, on which customers enjoy the world&#39;s best computing experiences. TV+ is an important leg on the stool of reasons for people to subscribe to an Apple One services bundle. But, still, it&#39;s at least a little worrisome that the area where I feel Apple most improved last year is one that is utterly unrelated to that core business.</p><p> Excellence, no matter how long sustained, is always precarious — delicate and fragile — and on the verge of succumbing to hubris and Father Time. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-07"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ My 2024 Apple Report Card</title></entry><entry><title>苹果对泄露信息和WSJ的前雇员解决了诉讼</title><link href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/apple-leaker-issues-apology/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w28" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2025：/linked//6.41552</id><published> 2025-02-07T18:10:53Z</published><updated> 2025-02-07T18：14：37Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

Not to mention the complications that were introduced with the switch from HFS+在2017年获得MACOS 10.13 High Sierra的APF，并在2019年与MACOS 10.15 Catalina饮用的启动音量。M系列Macs Boot Whorirder多于基于Intel的Mac。 Not <em>bad</em> weird. I think it&#39;s all justified in the pursuit of security (SIP stands for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102149" title="Apple Support: “About System Integrity Protection on your Mac”">System Integrity Protection</a> , and is aptly named) and elegant system architecture. But booting is now <em>makes-things-much-more-difficult-than-before</em> weird for tools like SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner.</p><p> It&#39;s also true that from the perspective of <em>most</em> Mac users, all of these changes have been, unambiguously, changes for the better. Catastrophic boot drive errors seem to occur with less frequency than ever. Part of that is simply because SSDs are far more reliable than spinning hard disks, but part of it too is that APFS seems more reliable than HFS+ ever was. HFS+ wasn&#39;t unreliable — and its reliability levelled up with the addition of journaling back in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-06">1</a></sup> — but APFS seems more reliable. When catastrophe does strike, the path to recovery is better than ever. In the old days, you&#39;d need to find a bootable system software DVD (or, going back in time, a CD, or a floppy...) or a bootable USB drive, and reinstall the OS from disk. In recent years, however, that&#39;s been replaced by the built-in <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="Apple Support: “Intro to macOS Recovery”">MacOS Recovery</a> system that lets you do things like run Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup, reinstall the entire OS from scratch, and more. No hunting around for a special CD/DVD or thumb drive (that Murphy&#39;s Law suggests you won&#39;t have handy when you suddenly find yourself needing one). Just long-press the power button on your Mac and boom — you&#39;re in Recovery mode.</p><p> I have no data to prove that APFS is more reliable than HFS+ was, so to check my gut feeling, I asked both John Siracusa (filesystem aficionado <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-06">2</a></sup> ) and Nanian (who works in the trenches of SuperDuper customer support). Both agreed that APFS is more reliable. Nanian further observed, though, that when things do go catastrophically wrong with an APFS disk now, it tends to be at a very low level — corruption at the container or volume level. And if Apple&#39;s own Disk Utility can&#39;t fix it, there aren&#39;t any third-party tools that can. <sup id="fnr3-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn3-2025-02-06">3</a></sup> That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is, if the problem really is just with uncorrectable corruption (and <em>not</em> a hardware failure with the device), you can use Recovery to fully erase the drive and container, clean install the OS, and restore your data from your backup drive using Migration Assistant — and that will almost certainly work.</p><p> So in some sense, the argument goes, there&#39;s no need for bootable clones of a startup drive any more. Just clone your data, not your whole drive, to an external drive for backup purposes, and if something goes wrong with your startup volume:</p><ol><li> <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac" title="Apple Support: “Intro to macOS Recovery”">Boot into Recovery</a> .</li><li> Try repairing the startup disk using Disk Utility from within Recovery. Hierarchically, you do this at the volume level first, then container level, then the device itself. A device encompasses containers, containers encompass volumes, and you should repair from the inside out. This support document from Apple, “ <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/repair-a-storage-device-dskutl1040/mac" title="Apple Support :“Repair a Storage Device in Disk Utility on Mac”">Repair a Storage Device in Disk Utility on Mac</a> ”, explains and illustrates the process.</li><li> If Disk Utility can&#39;t fix it, use Recovery to erase the disk, then install the OS.</li><li> During the first boot after the clean install, choose the option to “restore” (which is effectively like running Migration Assistant) and choose your external drive, with the backup clone of your previous startup volume, as the source. In other words, treat your restored Mac as though it&#39;s a brand-new Mac. (If you get to the point of creating a new, fresh user account, you&#39;ve gone too far.)</li></ol><p> The backup you use in step #3 above does not need to have MacOS installed on it, or, if it does have a bootable copy of MacOS, that version doesn&#39;t need to be the same version of MacOS that Recovery clean installed on the internal drive. In SuperDuper, you can just use “Backup - all files” with Smart Update, which clones everything in the writeable “Data” volume, but doesn&#39;t copy the OS from the read-only “System” (OS) volume (because it can&#39;t, for technical reasons you and I need not worry about — seriously, this stuff will take you <em>deep</em> into the weeds).</p><p> But let me try to speedrun through what I, as a SuperDuper user, want to know and understand. To make a clone of your internal startup drive to an external drive, you want to use “Backup - all files”. (SuperDuper&#39;s “Backup - user files” will only back up what&#39;s in user account home folders inside <code>/Users/</code> . That will include most of your personal files, but it won&#39;t include system-wide data that&#39;s shared between all users, such as applications you&#39;ve installed in the top-level <code>/Applications/</code> folder, or everything in <code>/Library/</code> . I&#39;m sure some people have a need for “Backup - user files”, but I don&#39;t. And it&#39;s worth pointing out that an external drive that contains cloned data from “Backup - user files” cannot serve as the source for Migration Assistant. That&#39;s a dealbreaker for me. The primary purpose of a SuperDuper backup, for me, is its ability to serve as the source for Migration Assistant, which, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs#fn2-2020-11-17">as I&#39;ve written previously</a> , is an astonishingly good and useful tool.)</p><p> When you run “Backup - all files”, you have the following options: <sup id="fnr4-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn4-2025-02-06">4</a></sup></p><ul><li> <em>Erase, then copy</em> — This completely erases the external destination volume before copying over the entire contents of your internal startup drive. This takes longer than Smart Update, but, importantly, “Erase, then copy” will clone the <em>entire</em> internal disk, including the read-only System volume containing MacOS. This should leave you with a <em>bootable</em> clone of your startup drive.</li><li> <em>Smart Update</em> — This does what you think a “smart” update would do. Instead of copying everything, every time, it just copies and erases what&#39;s necessary to make the Data volume on the destination disk identical to the Data volume on the source disk. If you start with a fresh, empty external drive as the destination, it has to copy everything, but subsequent Smart Update runs will run in a portion of the time. But the nature of how it works means that it can only clone the read/write Data volume of your startup drive. That means it won&#39;t copy the OS from the read-only System volume. No matter what else you do (which I&#39;m about to cover), that&#39;s OK, because the result of a Smart Update is an external drive containing all of your own files and installed apps, and, crucially, it&#39;s a disk that you can use as the source for Migration Assistant.</li></ul><p> So if you <em>always</em> use “Erase, then copy”, your SuperDuper external backups will always be bootable clones of your startup drive, with the same version of MacOS installed as your internal disk. The only downside to doing it this way is that backups take longer, because you&#39;re erasing the external drive and copying everything every time. (You don&#39;t have to supervise SuperDuper backups in any way, so how long they take doesn&#39;t really matter much.)</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Smart Update”, you won&#39;t have a bootable external drive (because the read-only System volume is never copied over), but you will have all your own files, and the external drive will work as a source for Migration Assistant.</p><p> If you <em>start</em> with “Erase, then copy” to create the initial backup clone, but <em>subsequently</em> use “Smart Update” for incremental backups, all of <em>your</em> data and installed apps will be updated on the external drive each time you back up. And the drive should remain a bootable backup — but the version of MacOS installed on the external drive will remain unchanged from the initial “Erase, then copy” backup. This is how I&#39;ve been running SuperDuper.</p><h2> Why Bootable Backup Drives Still Matter</h2><p> In the course of writing this article — which I&#39;ve been thinking about, and researching, on and off since December, when the MacOS 15.2 replicator bug broke SuperDuper&#39;s ability to create bootable backups — I&#39;ve shaken some of my own longstanding assumptions about my backup needs. I&#39;ve been making bootable clones with SuperDuper since whenever I started using it, which was over two decades ago. The earliest of mention of SuperDuper on Daring Fireball is this post, explaining how I installed OS updates at the time, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/12/software_update" title="Daring Fireball: “Software Update Tips and Voodoo”">from December 2004</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I use <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a> for cloning my entire startup drive.我强烈推荐它。</p></blockquote><p>还是真的！ I have no intention to stop making regular backups of my entire startup drive using SuperDuper. But: do I care anymore whether they&#39;re bootable? If you&#39;d asked me before December, I would have said yes, definitely.为什么？ Because, my thinking went, if something catastrophic happened to my internal startup drive, and I was working on something urgent, I&#39;d want to get back up and working again as soon as possible. Rather than wait for MacOS Recovery to reinstall the OS on the internal drive and then wait for Migration Assistant to copy my data from my external drive to the clean install of MacOS on the internal drive, I could just boot from the external backup drive and get back to work immediately.</p><p> I&#39;ve been lucky enough over my now many years as a Mac user to have suffered very few disk calamities like that. But I&#39;ve encountered them. And there have been situations when having an up-to-date bootable backup drive has been useful, if not crucial. But, upon reflection, I realize now that it&#39;s been many many years since the last time I even thought to boot from my backup drive. I used to even periodically test that the backup drive was, in fact, bootable, as a precaution.我好几年没做到了。</p><p> I mentioned above that for my regular backup cloning, I use SuperDuper&#39;s Smart Update, which leaves the read-only installation of MacOS on the backup drive unchanged. I just checked today and while my MacBook Pro is running the current version of MacOS (15.3 Sequoia), the version on my cloned backup drive was 12.6.1 Monterey, which was released in October 2022. (That&#39;s the last time I did a full “Erase, then copy” backup in SuperDuper.) That effectively means my backup drive <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been bootable, or at least not <em>usefully</em> bootable. For example, all my email files are in the mailbox format expected by Apple Mail in MacOS 15.3; I doubt that Apple Mail from MacOS 12.6 can read those mailbox files. The same is probably true for just about every app — or at least every system app from Apple — that I use. Surely <em>some</em> software from MacOS 12.6 can&#39;t read the files or settings from the software from MacOS 15.3, and I&#39;ll bet a lot of it can&#39;t. New software can often recognize old file formats generated by older versions of the software; old software can&#39;t recognize new file formats that were introduced after the old software was written.</p><p> What you should do, if you really want bootable startup drive backups via SuperDuper, is use “Erase, then copy” after every MacOS software update. Or just use “Erase, then copy” every time. But the fact that I wasn&#39;t doing this for the last two years doesn&#39;t mean my cloned backup drive has been useless. It just means it&#39;s only been useful for restoring backed-up data, not for booting my Mac. Which, when I think about it, is how I would have used it if I had needed to. I don&#39;t work in a fast-paced production environment with tight deadlines. I think MacBooks really only run properly when booting from their internal drives, anyway. If something ever goes wrong with mine, I&#39;ll try using Disk Utility to repair it, and if that fails, I&#39;ll turn to MacOS Recovery to clean install the OS and then use Migration Assistant to copy my data back from my external backup驾驶。</p><p> Thinking about it, booting from an old version of MacOS on an external backup drive containing data from the current version of MacOS sounds like a good way to corrupt some of the files on that disk — subverting the entire purpose of a backup. (Most likely, if you try this, the Mac will simply fail to boot.) It&#39;s reckless to boot from and “use” a backup drive for production when the source drive that it&#39;s a clone of has failed — at that point, your backup drive is your only local copy of the data from that failed drive. It really only ought to be treated as a read-only source for restoration. And the way Macs are designed to work today, with MacOS Recovery and Migration Assistant, makes that pretty easy.</p><p> The last time I had a catastrophic problem with my startup drive was in 2010, and I wrote about how I recovered, gracefully and with no drama (nor, seemingly, an iota of lost data), in a piece I titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox">An Ode to DiskWarrior, SuperDuper, and Dropbox</a> ”. More of my digital life is in the cloud — and thus replicated in at least one place other than my Mac&#39;s startup drive — now than then. Off the top of my head, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of anything I do on my Mac that isn&#39;t synced to cloud storage via Dropbox, iCloud, or IMAP. Starting in 2014 I&#39;ve also been a customer of <a href="https://backblaze.com/thetalkshow">Backblaze</a> , a set-it-and-forget-it online backup service (that, for many years, has been a regular sponsor of this site and The Talk Show, but I recommend it because it&#39;s good, not because they have been and might someday again be a sponsor). That&#39;s <em>another</em> copy of all my personal data backed up somewhere. <sup id="fnr5-2025-02-06"><a href="#fn5-2025-02-06">5</a></sup></p><p> Having my SuperDuper-cloned backup drive be bootable is nice to have, but I really can&#39;t say I <em>need</em> it any more. 20, 15, even just 10 years ago, that wasn&#39;t true — I really did want the ability to boot from my backup drive at a moment&#39;s notice. But that&#39;s really not true any more for me. It probably isn&#39;t for you, either. It definitely isn&#39;t true for most Mac users.</p><p> But it remains true for <em>some</em> people, who are using (or responsible for) Macs in high-pressure tight-deadline production environments. Live broadcast studios. Magazines or newspapers with a deadline for the printer that&#39;s just hours (or minutes) away. Places with strict security/privacy rules that forbid cloud storage of certain critical files. If the startup drive on a production machine fails, they need to get up and running <em>now</em> . Plug in a backup drive, restart, and go. Anything longer than that is unacceptable.</p><p> That&#39;s not me. That&#39;s probably not you. But there are a lot of people whose work environment that describes. For as much as Apple Silicon Macs have become iOS-like devices in many ways, they&#39;re still Macs at heart: workstations. There remain people inside Apple who know that, too.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-06"><p> Fun fact gleaned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">the Wikipedia entry for HFS Plus</a> : “Codenamed <em>Sequoia</em> in development, HFS+ was introduced with the January 19, 1998, release of Mac OS 8.1.” I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s further proof that Apple has a penchant for reusing old code names, or if code-name reuse is simply inevitable for a nearly 49-year-old company that&#39;s always been chockablock with secret projects. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-06"><p> <em>Ding.</em> <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="在文本中跳回脚注2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2025-02-06"><p> One of the ways that APFS is very “modern Apple” is that it&#39;s largely a black box.

It&#39;s surprising that any of it survived. As a kid/teen in the &#39;80s, everything of mine existed only on floppy disks. Even the smallest-capacity hard drives were exorbitantly expensive. Apple&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Disk_20">Hard Disk 20</a> was a 20 megabyte external drive that cost $1,500 when it debuted in 1985, which is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">about $4,400</a> in today&#39;s dollars. That was a ton of money. But the floppy disks of the time were just 400 KB — a Hard Disk 20 gave you the storage of 50 of them. But even floppy disks were expensive, to a kid. We&#39;d fill them up faster than we could buy them, and we&#39;d re-use the same floppies over and over when we needed a “new” one — often begrudgingly erasing whatever was previously on the old one. That was not great for data integrity on a storage medium so primitive that it was exposed to the air. In the &#39;90s we all had hard drives, but those hard drives were always almost full. We were constantly copying files off our hard drives to floppies for “storage”, to create a little free space. It felt like remarkable progress when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive">Zip disks</a> appeared, which were like “super floppies”, each containing 100 MB. We lived our digital lives one catastrophic hard drive failure away from losing almost all of our files, and the hard drives of that era were, by today&#39;s standards, flaky as hell. (If you heard your hard drive start to <em>click</em> , you panicked, and immediately began copying your most important files to another disk or disks.)</p><p> My grandparents&#39; generation lived through the Great Depression, and they wound up with, to my generation&#39;s eyes, very odd ideas about the availability and abundance of food. Many of the people who grew up in an era when food was profoundly scarce, wound up treating food as a scarcity for the remainder of their lives. They ate whatever was on their plate, whether they enjoyed it or not, and they were offended by anyone who didn&#39;t.</p><p> It&#39;s clear to me that I came of age during an era of computing when storage was both scarce and unreliable. I like to think that I&#39;ve adapted with the times, especially given what I do for a living.我<em>知道</em>今天的存储方式不同 - 丰富，便宜，可靠 - 但是我仍然对植根于遥远过去的数据有<em>感觉</em>。 <a href="#fnr5-2025-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Bootable Mac Startup Drive Backups, and Another Ode to SuperDuper</title></entry><entry><title> Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple&#39;s App Store </title><link href="https://x.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1886649436685693082" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w26" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41550</id><published> 2025-02-05T00:02:45Z</published><updated> 2025-02-06T22:48:15Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, on X:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is being extremely disingenuous in attacking the European Union here. The iOS App Store hosts the Reddit app, which provides access to massive amounts of porn. Apple knows this, permits it, and gave Reddit a 17+ (!!!) rating and Editors Choice award. [...]</p><p> As a recently deleted (by who?) post on the r/iOS subreddit explains, Apple&#39;s iOS App Store welcomes apps that host tons of porn, as Reddit does, as long as the majority of the content isn&#39;t porn, and the app has controls to hide the porn.</p></blockquote><p> Sweeney has a real point here, and it really is a bit of a conundrum. I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s alluding to with the “by who?” parenthetical, but I don&#39;t think one deleted Reddit thread on the topic was the result of Apple dispatching some Men in Black agents to knock on Reddit&#39;s door. Reddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/mt4l64/why_can_ios_apps_like_reddit_and_twitter_host/">full</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l03kt7/why_is_the_reddit_app_still_in_the_app_stores/">non-deleted</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/seu2zx/why_does_apple_ban_from_the_appstore_apps_like/">threads</a> from people asking variations of the same question. And the press has been covering the saga <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/reddit-ios-apps-disappear-nsfw-content/">for a decade</a> .</p><p> But how is it possible that these super popular platforms have apps in the no-porn App Store while hosting tons of porn? It&#39;s an issue with Reddit, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/tumblr-adds-sensitive-content-filter-to-ios-app">with Tumblr</a> ( <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">times</a> ), and apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/04/x-twitter-porn-policy-under-18-opt-in">especially so with X</a> (fka Twitter). (I&#39;m not trying to feign prudishness here, but I&#39;ve heard, several times, that you really <em>don&#39;t</em> want to go looking for NSFW content on X because what you&#39;ll find is ... something.)</p><p> I think Sweeney&#39;s synopsis captures Apple&#39;s de facto policy accurately, with the exception that they don&#39;t <em>welcome</em> apps that host porn (so long as the app has controls to hide it, and if the adult content is effectively a side hustle in the overall context of the app), but <em>tolerate</em> it. It&#39;s a de facto policy of tolerating unadvertised pornographic content on platforms that are too big to ban from the App Store without generating far more of an outcry than any controversy over the side-hustle porn will.</p><p> Some banks are too big to fail. Some platforms are too big to ban. Apple won&#39;t say that, but that&#39;s clearly the tacit policy. It&#39;s not confusing that the exceptions are super popular apps — they are exceptions <em>because</em> they&#39;re super popular. And it&#39;s absolutely not a policy of looking the other way — Apple&#39;s policing of the situation is an enormous never-ending pain in the ass for the platforms involved. To see NSFW content in the iOS Reddit app, for example, you need to be signed in, <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061032831-How-do-I-view-NSFW-communities">and enable an off-by-default setting</a> . <a href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/potentially-mature-content/">Tumblr does similar</a> . You can&#39;t just download the Reddit or Tumblr apps from the App Store and innocuously find yourself viewing pornography.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Tim Sweeney on the Apps With Porn in Apple’s App Store’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/sweeney-porno-apps">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> AltStore PAL Is Free of Charge, Thanks to &#39;MegaGrant&#39; From Epic Games </title><link href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w25" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/altstore-pal-epic" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41549</id><published> 2025-02-04T23:23:51Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T23:23:52Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>From <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/113940550587737112">an AltStore announcement yesterday</a> :</p><blockquote><p> iPhone turns 18 this year, which means it&#39;s finally old enough for some more ~mature~ apps…</p><p> Introducing Hot Tub by c1d3r, the world&#39;s 1st Apple-approved porn app!</p></blockquote><p> The screenshots and video previews are blurred-for-obfuscation by default, but <a href="https://hottubapp.io/">Hot Tub&#39;s website</a> makes pretty clear that the content it aggregates is serious porn. Figuratively speaking, they&#39;re not fucking around. Literally speaking, that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re aggregating — including an in-app “teens” channel.</p><p> Describing Hot Tub as “Apple-approved” is cheeky, if we&#39;re being generous, and downright misleading if we&#39;re not. What they mean is that Hot Tub was duly notarized by Apple — an ostensibly technical, not editorial, review that encompasses (using terms <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">from Apple&#39;s own documentation</a> ) accuracy, functionality, safety, security, and privacy. I say “ostensibly” there because Apple has, controversially, refused to notarize apps for other reasons, including in November <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">when it rejected for notarization the classic Mac emulator Mini vMac</a> , on the grounds that Mini vMac both violated Apple&#39;s software licensing terms and misused Apple&#39;s trademarks.</p><p> But pornography has pretty much always been Apple&#39;s canonical example for the sort of content they do not want in the App Store, and thus — because Apple&#39;s stance is that the App Store ought to be the sole source for consumer software for iOS — the sort of content they do not consider appropriate for native apps. You&#39;ve been able to watch porno on your iPhone since the first day it shipped — a full year ahead of the App Store — by using the web. Apple&#39;s line has always been clear: native apps = Apple-approved; the web = anything goes. (That same line goes for payment processing for digital goods and services as well.)</p><p> Back in 2010, MG Siegler (then at TechCrunch) reported on an email exchange between Steve Jobs and customer Matthew Browing. Browing wrote to Jobs:</p><blockquote><p> It appears that more and more Apple is determining for its consumers what content they should be able to receive. For instance, the blocking of Mark Fiore&#39;s comic app (due to being political satire) or blocking of what Apple considers to be porn.</p><p> I&#39;m all for keeping porn out of kids hands. Heck — I&#39;m all for ensuring that I don&#39;t have to see it unless I want to. But… that&#39;s what parental controls are for. Put these types of apps into categories and allow them to be blocked by their parents should they want to.</p><p> Apple&#39;s role isn&#39;t moral police — Apple&#39;s role is to design and produce really cool gadgets that do what the consumer wants them to do.</p></blockquote><p> Jobs responded:</p><blockquote><p> Fiore&#39;s app will be in the store shortly.那是一个错误。 However, we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone. Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.</p></blockquote><p> (The man knew how to write an email.)</p><p> Fast-forward to the present, and Apple has been citing pornography as one of its reasons for adamantly opposing the EU&#39;s DMA from the very beginning. Last year, after the DMA went into effect, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91021439/apple-phil-schiller-iphone-app-store-alternative-eu-risk-security">FastCompany&#39;s Michael Grothaus interviewed App Store chief Phil Schiller</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Schiller is quick to point out that despite these new security measures, there are limits to the protections that Apple can provide to users who allow alternative app marketplaces to operate on their iPhones. The company has virtually no control over the content of apps from those marketplaces — even if that content is objectionable or harmful.</p><p> “Ultimately, there are things that we have not allowed on our App Store — things that we didn&#39;t think would be safe or appropriate,” Schiller says. “It will not be our decision whether those other marketplaces have the same terms and limitations.”</p><p> So yes, for the first time, apps dedicated to pornography can be run on the iPhone. This should be something parents are aware of, because the DMA does not give Apple the legal right to forbid certain types of app stores from operating on its platform, nor does Apple have the ability to prevent a child from downloading such an app store onto their iPhone。</p></blockquote><p> And, lastly, with regard to Hot Tub and AltStore in particular, Apple issued this statement to media outlets, including Daring Fireball, yesterday:</p><blockquote><p> We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids. This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world. Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store. The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.</p></blockquote><p> So, no, Apple neither approves of Hot Tub in particular, nor the ability to distribute native porn apps in general. Everyone involved with both AltStore and Hot Tub knows this, but they also know that framing it this way — the announcement came with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/introducing-hot-tub-banner.png">this banner graphic</a> promoting Hot Tub as “The First Apple-Approved Porn App” — is a good way to <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250203/p16#a250203p16">get headlines</a> . (The Verge: “ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604937/iphone-ios-porn-app-hot-tub-altstore-pal-eu">The First &#39;Approved&#39; iPhone Porn App Is Coming to Europe</a> ” — which aside from the mild clickbait slant, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/eu_share_of_apples_revenue">misleadingly conflates “Europe” with “the EU”</a> .) But there&#39;s some undeniable <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/10/02/schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> seeing Apple on the wrong end <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/11/26/mini-vmac-for-ios-rejected-via-notarization/">of notarization being used as a tool to convey subject-matter approval</a> . [ <strong>Update:</strong> And now <a href="https://www.threads.net/@altstoreio/post/DFqg4vfy7B4">it&#39;s become a thing</a> , where AltStore is sticking to their guns that Hot Tub, having been notarized, is thus “approved” by Apple. C&#39;mon.]</p><p> If we want to get nitty-gritty over verbs, I&#39;d argue that Apple <em>accepts</em> apps — like Hot Tub — for notarization, not <em>approves</em> . Begrudging <em>acceptance</em> is more of a thing than begrudging <em>approval</em> .</p><p> But, as Apple itself emphasizes in its statement, the DMA requires them to allow it. I&#39;ve seen no celebratory <a href="https://x.com/teresaribera">tweets</a> or <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/home/en">announcements from European Commission officials</a> celebrating the availability of Hot Tub. Just crickets chirping. When it comes to native iOS porn apps, the EU now has an unequivocal advantage over not just the United States but the rest of the world.

<p>The LBJ Presidential Library, regarding a largely ad-libbed address Lyndon Johnson gave to a group of 150 non-incumbent Democratic candidates for Congress in 1966:</p><blockquote><p> He talked about the difference between Republicans and Democrats: “We&#39;re for something, and they are against everything. Mr. Rayburn was asked one time, &#39;What do you think — after 50 years — is the primary difference between the Republican and Democratic parties? Is it the tariff?&#39;</p><p> “&#39;不。&#39;</p><p> “&#39;Well, what is the difference?&#39;</p><p> “先生。 Rayburn replied, &#39;I&#39;ll tell you the easiest and best explanation — one that I have observed, and I came here during Woodrow Wilson&#39;s administration. They hate all of our Presidents.&#39;</p><p> “He said, &#39;I didn&#39;t hate Harding. I felt sorry for him, but I didn&#39;t hate him.&#39; He said, &#39;I didn&#39;t hate Coolidge. I thought he was totally inadequate to the responsibility, but I used to go down and eat scrambled eggs and just watch him. He never said anything. You couldn&#39;t tell what he thought of anything.&#39;</p><p> “He said, &#39;I didn&#39;t get angry with Hoover. Everything in the country folded up and we had bread lines all over the country and everybody in the Southwest was chasing rabbits in order to eat. But I didn&#39;t hate him. We tried to help him. But look what they did to Roosevelt when he came in. They were after his wife. They were after his daughter. And they finally got down after his dog.&#39;”</p><p> And LBJ pointed toward the South Lawn where his beagles were kept and said: “And I&#39;ve got three of them out there to jump on if they want to.”</p><p> He talked about the difference between constructive action and obstructive action: “Any jackass can kick a barn down. But it takes a carpenter to build one.”</p></blockquote><p> Much has changed in the last 60 years. Much has not.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘LBJ on the Difference between Republicans and Democrats’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/lbj-republicans-democrats">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Apple in China&#39; — New Book by Patrick McGee, Coming in May </title><link href="https://appleinchina.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w21" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/apple-in-china-mcgee" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41545</id><published> 2025-02-03T22:57:20Z</published><updated> 2025-02-04T21:18:09Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat">Speaking of books</a> , Simon &amp; Schuster announced a new one:</p><blockquote><p> Apple isn&#39;t just a brand; it&#39;s the world&#39;s most valuable company and creator of the twenty-first century&#39;s defining product. The iPhone has revolutionized the way we live, work and connect. But Apple is now a victim of its own success, caught in the middle of a new Cold War between two superpowers.</p><p> On the brink of bankruptcy in 1996, Apple launched a new strategy to outsource its manufacturing. After experimenting in eight countries, nearly all of its operations were lured to China by the promises of affordable, ubiquitous labour. As the iPod and iPhone transformed Apple&#39;s fortunes, their sophisticated production played a seminal role financing, training, supervising, and supplying Chinese manufacturers — skills Beijing is now weaponizing against the West.</p><p> <em>Apple in China</em> is the sometimes disturbing and always revelatory story of how an outspoken, proud company that once praised “rebels” and “troublemakers” — the company that encouraged us all to “Think Different” — devolved into a silent, passive partner to a belligerent regime that increasingly controls its fate.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve long been a fan of McGee&#39;s work as the Financial Times&#39;s Silicon Valley correspondent. Two years ago, the Financial Times ran a good two-part series by McGee that seemingly started him down the path to this book: “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5a80891-b27d-4110-90c9-561b7836f11b?accessToken=zwAAAZTN6lqvkdPVqAiRsn1BENOQyVYbeDbxGw.MEQCIBLmEdWXrV1FdyaYLM95iSpk2NbUN4rXb9DW3wSvZwzXAiBZ3xoDR8WENu91A2AKCy1xlinW7S6wSnK_6vU54_3U0A&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=fca686db-d401-45aa-9413-19bed1c546a8" title="McGee in the FT in January 2023, pt. 1/2: “How Apple Tied Its Fortunes to China”">How Apple Tied Its Fortunes to China</a> ”, and “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/74f7e284-c047-4cc4-9b7a-408d40611bfa?accessToken=zwAAAZTN6rGikc909-KEwEdMxNObekCNQGEb-g.MEQCIFEiKzIfwaWOAw4oWCS2qJRTOxYvWRq_aOiLL9W52cReAiBGMxJbNZy8AO52S8J_NOHjfVsgX5tal9cYFkwRRnKGQg&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=2081eba1-72f0-4c8c-8cae-91bc46718e97" title="McGee in the FT in January 2023, pt. 2/2: “What It Would Take for Apple to Disentangle Itself From China”">What It Would Take for Apple to Disentangle Itself From China</a> ”。 Both are worth reading. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/ft-apple-china-manufacture-country.png">This chart from the first report</a> shows just how reliant Apple remains on Chinese manufacturing, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/ft-apple-china-iphone-share.png">this one from the second</a> shows just how remarkably profitable the iPhone is.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Apple in China’ — New Book by Patrick McGee, Coming in May’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/apple-in-china-mcgee">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Rick Reilly&#39;s &#39;Commander in Cheat&#39; </title><link href="https://amzn.to/3Q8UJWd" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w20" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/commander-in-cheat" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41544</id><published> 2025-02-03T18:54:33Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T22:59:33Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">Speaking of cheating</a> , my favorite book from Trump&#39;s first term was Rick Reilly&#39;s <em>Commander in Cheat</em> , which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/09/commander-in-cheat">I linked to</a> , with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/02/donald-trump-golf-28-club-championships">an excerpt still available at The Guardian</a> , when it came out in 2019.

<p>Drew Harwell, at The Washington Post (gift link, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drewharwell.com/post/3lguxbx6fgc25">via Harwell himself on Bluesky</a> — which seemingly uses a ludicrously long 397-character token in the URL):</p><blockquote><p> But after poring over his live-streamed gameplay, online sleuths recently made a shocking accusation: Musk had cheated. They suspected that he had pursued a widely mocked tactic known as “boosting,” paying strangers to play his character and rake in loot so that, when he logged in, he could face challenges with the most powerful gear.</p><p> Musk fought the allegations before ultimately confessing in messages this month. “It&#39;s impossible to beat players in Asia if you don&#39;t,” he wrote. A few days later, his character could be seen chasing treasure through the game&#39;s sulfuric caverns while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/billionaires-trump-inauguration-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/">Musk was in the Capitol Rotunda, attending President Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration</a> .</p></blockquote><p> Every cheater&#39;s story is the same: “ <em>I&#39;m not cheating, and I&#39;m offended you&#39;d accuse me.</em> ” Then, presented with incontrovertible proof, “ <em>I had to cheat because everyone else is cheating so it&#39;s the only way to win, and anyone who isn&#39;t doing it is a simp.</em> ” But the simple truth is that cheaters are rotten people, and most people naturally despise cheating.</p><blockquote><p> But watching Musk&#39;s streams, Jake began to suspect foul play. The billionaire did amateurish things, such as failing to drink mana flasks when he needed them and trying to pick up items when his inventory was full. And he made comments that struck devoted players as clueless, saying, for instance, that his character&#39;s “Hand of Wisdom and Action” gloves, which rank among the game&#39;s most valuable items, “could be better.” A normal gamer could write these off as simple flubs in the heat of battle, Jake said. But Musk was supposedly a global grand master, and gamers at that level don&#39;t make these kinds of mistakes.</p><p> “It&#39;s like if you said you&#39;re the number two truck driver in the world … and when you try to get the truck to turn on, the windshield wipers start going,” Jake said. “It just felt like there was no way this guy did this.”</p><p> When Jake posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1hwxc17/documenting_the_saga_of_elon_musks_account/">thread</a> on Reddit documenting Musk&#39;s “suspicious” gameplay, the accusations kicked up a firestorm, with “Path of Exile 2” fans scraping through the streams Musk had posted to X for clues of what some were calling his <a href="https://x.com/Diamonte916/status/1878047536336052365">“stolen valor.透明</a>[...]</p><p> By paying someone else to earn him his high-level gear, they said, he had removed most of the challenge — only to boast how quickly he had beaten others who played fair and square. One poster on a Diablo subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1hxi3vh/gamers_are_accusing_elon_musk_of_cheating_at/">called</a> it “unbelievably pathetic” that the world&#39;s richest man would feel “the need to cheat” in a video game to “claim he is good at something” most people “couldn&#39;t care less about.”</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s the boasting that&#39;s most revealing.</p><p> It&#39;s a trope as old as fiction itself that villains cheat at everything. Auric Goldfinger cheated at golf, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBvu-fTTIk">famously</a> . And in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moonraker-James-Bond-Ian-Fleming/dp/1612185452/?tag=df-amzn-20">Ian Fleming&#39;s <em>Moonraker</em></a> (but not the movie), the whole plot was driven by M&#39;s suspicion that mysterious millionaire (the billionaire of the 1950s) industrialist Hugo Drax was cheating at cards at their gentlemen&#39;s club. He assigned Bond to figure out how he was cheating, and Bond stumbled into Drax&#39;s plot to annihilate London. Drax, you see, is in fact a Nazi. And his industry: rocketry.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Elon Musk Cheats at Video Games’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/elon-musk-cheats-at-video-games">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Don&#39;t Believe Him&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1y" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/03/dont-believe-him" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41542</id><published> 2025-02-03T15:37:24Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T17:27:33Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ezra Klein in an audio essay/transcribed column at The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> That is the tension at the heart of Trump&#39;s whole strategy: Trump is acting like a king because he is too weak to govern like a president. He is trying to substitute perception for reality. He is hoping that perception then becomes reality. That can only happen if we believe him. [...]</p><p> What Trump wants you to see in all this activity is command. What is really in all this activity is chaos. They do not have some secret reservoir of focus and attention the rest of us do not. They have convinced themselves that speed and force is a strategy unto itself — that it is, in a sense, a replacement for a real strategy. Don&#39;t believe them.</p></blockquote><p> It is easy and quick, often instantaneous, to destroy things. It is hard and slow work to build new things, and often even harder and slower work to improve existing ones.</p><blockquote><p> I had a conversation a couple months ago with someone who knows how the federal government works about as well as anyone alive. I asked him what would worry him most if he saw Trump doing it. What he told me is that he would worry most if Trump went slowly. If he began his term by doing things that made him more popular and made his opposition weaker and more confused. If he tried to build strength for the midterms while slowly expanding his powers and chipping away at the deep state where it was weakest.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s the optimistic take — Trump and his new administration are trying to manically (or is it maniacally?) punch their way to a first-round knockout. They&#39;re utterly unprepared for a 15-round grueling slog. The pessimistic take is that the first-round knockout might happen.</p><p> The ultimate power in America isn&#39;t our political or legal systems.这是我们的文化。 Our collective attitudes. We, collectively, are quite obviously very bad at history, because we, collectively, clearly forgot how chaotic a Trump presidency is <em>after just four years</em> , and we forgot how much we dislike chaotic leadership. But <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">we know what we don&#39;t like</a> and we&#39;re vocal about it.

The app is the playground — a place for playing with Swift — not a factory for making playgrounds.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Swift Playground Gets an Update and Loses Its Plural’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/02/swift-playground-no-s">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Where Are the Bluesky Clients? </title><link href="https://parker.micro.blog/2025/01/29/where-are-the-bluesky-clients.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1u" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/02/where-are-the-bluesky-clients" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41538</id><published> 2025-02-02T20:52:10Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T17:06:51Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Parker Ortolani:</p><blockquote><p> Mastodon clients have become the new UI playground in the same way that Twitter clients used to be. But what I can&#39;t wrap my head around is the business decision of developers to lean into Mastodon clients versus Bluesky ones. Fortunately some progress seems to be starting to be made with apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740792786">PinkSky</a> that replicate the Instagram experience but using Bluesky as the backend. There are also a handful of clients like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6466340923">Skeets</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graysky-a-bluesky-client/id6448234181">GraySky</a> , but nothing that approaches the quality of some Mastodon clients or the legendary Twitter clients of old. They&#39;re okay, but they&#39;re not worth dropping the official client. Other apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1666230916">OpenVibe</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485">Reeder</a> are designed to combine feeds from multiple services and they do work with Bluesky. But they&#39;re not dedicated clients. I want Tweetbot or Twitterrific, but for Bluesky. I&#39;m not seeing that yet. The opportunity is clearly there, it has tens of millions of users making it three times the size of Mastodon.</p></blockquote><p> One thing all the existing nascent Bluesky clients lack is timeline position saving/sync — so when you leave the app and come back later (with sync, even on a different device) you can pick up reading exactly where you left off. I find it hard to imagine paying for a Bluesky client that didn&#39;t do this.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> About a month ago, Skeets developer Sebastian Vogelsang <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skeetsapp.com/post/3lfa32kfctc26">posted a thread about running into API limitations</a> trying to implement position-saving, a feature that&#39;s in beta, and available to Skeets Pro users. I&#39;m giving it a shot.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Where Are the Bluesky Clients?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/02/where-are-the-bluesky-clients">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/soon-shiong_la_times_propaganda_rag" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1t" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41537</id><published> 2025-02-01T17:18:51Z</published><updated> 2025-02-03T21:19:11Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><summary type="text"><![CDATA[You can’t see the link or click on it as rendered in a browser, because there’s no content between the opening `<a …> ` and closing ` ` tags, but whoever at the LA Times edited Reinhart&#39;s column to pervert its meaning, did so sloppily, leaving behind at least this one acerbic vestigial link from his originally-submitted prose.]]>; </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">Editors note from The New Republic</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As The New Republic <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/191007/la-times-robert-f-kennedy-jr-donald-trump">reported on Friday</a> , The Los Angeles Times — currently in a race to the bottom <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/188445/washington-post-bezos-trump-failure">with The Washington Post</a> to determine which of the two venerable institutions can sell out to Donald Trump the hardest — found itself in a fresh controversy after contributor Eric Reinhart accused the paper of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">making significant edits</a> to a piece of his that was largely critical of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. into one that depicted the president&#39;s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services with an “optimistic tone,” largely “suggesting that the virulent conspiracy theorist could be an answer and solution to the American public&#39;s bubbling resentment toward the health care industry.”</p><p> Reinhart exposed the shady goings-on on X (fka Twitter). “Editing out the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author&#39;s clear intent is pretty shitty,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericreinhart.bsky.social/post/3lh2ell45722u">he wrote</a> . In light of this lamentable journalistic malpractice, The New Republic has agreed to run Reinhart&#39;s piece as he intended it to be read.</p></blockquote><p> Reinhart&#39;s headline at TNR, encapsulating the intended thrust of his piece: “ <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191030/rfk-jr-op-ed-los-angeles-times">RFK Jr&#39;s Wrecking Ball Won&#39;t Fix Public Health</a> ”, and the closing paragraph of the column:</p><blockquote><p> Although RFK, Jr., and Luigi Mangione are both responses to the same underlying problem of US healthcare corruption, there is a major difference between them: one allegedly operated outside the law to kill one person in defense of millions, whereas the other — via his egomaniacal <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">disregard</a> for scientific evidence — seeks to use law itself to inflict preventable death on those millions.</p></blockquote><p> The headline the LA Times ran his piece under, after their editing: “ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-01-29/rfk-jr-trump-health-reform">Trump&#39;s Healthcare Disruption Could Pay Off — if He Pushes Real Reform</a> ”, and its closing paragraphs:</p><blockquote><p> Such an approach would shift us away from overreliance on expensive medical treatments and toward public health as it should be: a project by and for <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/152/4/245/118232/Empowering-the-Extra-Ordinary">the people</a> that makes full use of government resources to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/02/24/fixing-public-health-systems-revolution-physicians-take-backseat/">empower communities</a> .</p><p> We should demand fundamental transformations in how we approach health in America, but a wrecking ball alone won&#39;t deliver what we need.</p></blockquote><p> After all the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post">shenanigans</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/owner-patrick-soon-shiong-is-tanking-the-la-times">Soon-Shiong began pulling</a> pre- <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/soon-shiong-la-times">and post-election</a> , my only question here is whether Reinhart really believed the LA Times op-ed page was going to run his piece as written.</p><h2> Super-Nerdy Bonus Material</h2><p> My original intention for this post ended above. I wanted to quote the TNR editors note that explained the situation, quote Reinhart&#39;s intended headline and closing paragraph, and contrast those with the benign gibberish headline and closing that the LA Times actually published.完毕。 But I&#39;ve got more. Turns out, the LA Times itself effectively published <em>proof</em> of its “editing” that completely perverted Reinhart&#39;s intended thrust.</p><p> I have a small arsenal of homegrown tools I use to automate the work of writing DF. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> itself is the crown jewel of them. But over the now many years I&#39;ve been doing this I&#39;ve created a whole toolbox of scripts and macros that help me do what I do faster and with fewer errors. (And I still commit plenty of errors.) One of the smaller ones that I&#39;ve never shared publicly (but probably <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/">should</a> ) is a Keyboard Maestro macro that lets me select a range of text in Safari and copy that selection as Markdown-formatted文本。 It picks up spans of italics and boldfacing, but most importantly, it picks up hyperlinks in the original text and converts them to the Markdown link style I prefer ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">defined reference links</a> ).</p><p> You will note in my blockquote above of Reinhart&#39;s intended closing paragraph, as published at The New Republic, he linked the word “disregard” to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/">this January 28 report from The Washington Post</a> : “RFK Jr. Disparaged Vaccines Dozens of Times in Recent Years and Made Baseless Claims on Race”. No link to that Washington Post report appears, visually, in the butchered version of Reinhart&#39;s piece that ran in the LA Times.</p><p> But, my “Copy Markdown Blockquote” macro picked up an effectively invisible-to-the-user link to that article, in the HTML markup between their closing paragraph and Reinhart&#39;s author bio beneath it. You can view source at the LA Times website and see for yourself, but here&#39;s a screenshot:</p><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/la-times-reinhart-html-screenshot.png" class="noborder"><img

<p>Alex Heath, writing at The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Moments after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s all-hands comments to employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/603754/mark-zuckerberg-tells-employees-to-buckle-up-in-leaked-all-hands-meeting">were widely leaked</a> , a company executive warned in an internal memo that leakers will be fired.</p><p> “We take leaks seriously and will take action,” Meta&#39;s chief information security officer, Guy Rosen, said in an internal memo I&#39;ve seen. [...] Rosen goes on to say that Meta “will take appropriate action, including termination” if it identifies leakers and that “we recently terminated relationships with employees who leaked confidential company information inappropriately and exfiltrated sensitive documents.”</p><p> During today&#39;s all-hands meeting, Zuckerberg told employees he would no longer be as transparent due to leaks. “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks,” he said. “It sucks.”</p></blockquote><p> Just about every well-run and successful company I&#39;m aware of fires leakers. Or really it&#39;s the opposite: it&#39;s difficult to succeed as a company with no institutional trust between employees. But company cultures are infused by the personalities of their founders. Meta employees have no scruples surrounding the privacy of internal communications because, by definition, they&#39;re the sort of people who never saw any problem with Meta&#39;s complete lack of regard for such things. So they don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sheeraf.bsky.social/post/3lgykn4gqmk2v">leak what they don&#39;t like</a> . Zuck gets no loyalty because he hired an entire company of people with no convictions other than “winning” or whatever it really is that Meta sees as its central tenet.</p><p> It&#39;s not fear of getting fired that keeps employees at most companies from leaking. It&#39;s that they find themselves aligned with the company&#39;s mission. They feel like part of a team that they want to see succeed, and they naturally adopt an attitude of being a team player. Team players don&#39;t leak the playbook because they don&#39;t like the coach&#39;s play-calling or how much playing time they&#39;re getting. I&#39;ve never gotten the sense that that sort of attitude exists at Meta.</p><p> This is a company that bought a popular VPN app (Onavo) and then <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat">used it to snoop on users&#39; encrypted SnapChat traffic</a> . They used it <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/08/10/facebook-copycatting">to snoop on users to determine the popularity of WhatsApp before purchasing it</a> . This wasn&#39;t some rogue operation in a corner of the company — it was a core strategic asset that led directly to a $20 billion acquisition. Onavo was just flat-out spyware and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/22/facebook-onavo-app-store">Apple kicked it out of the App Store in 2018</a> . For years — years — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/29/facebook-teens-vpn">Meta paid users aged 13–35 up to $20 a month to install a “Facebook Research” app</a> that let Meta study every single thing they did on their phones. An app like that couldn&#39;t be distributed through the App Store, of course, so Meta distributed it by abusing the iOS “enterprise” developer program; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facebook-and-google-offered-gift-cards-for-root-level-access-to-ios-users-data/">when Apple pulled Meta&#39;s enterprise certificate over the fiasco</a> , its employees <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/30/apple-disables-facebook-internal-apps/">couldn&#39;t use their own internal apps to buy food or take a company shuttle bus</a> .</p><p> It would be a wonder if the sort of people who would do stuff like that — or go to work at a company that does things like that — were <em>not</em> incorrigible leakers of embarrassing information and communications. Zuck&#39;s exasperation over the disloyalty of his own employees is like hiring a team of pickpockets and then complaining that sandwiches keep going missing from the gang&#39;s hangout fridge.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Perfect Headline: ‘Meta Warns That It Will Fire Leakers in Leaked Memo’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/meta-warns-leakers-in-leaked-memo">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The WSJ on Zuckerberg&#39;s $25 Million Payoff to Trump </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?st=mqxsa5&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/wsj-suck-trump-payoff" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41535</id><published> 2025-01-31T20:53:30Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T20:53:31Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Annie Linskey and Rebecca Ballhaus, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p><blockquote><p> “It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said in a statement. “After Meta pays to play, what does Mark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?”</p><p> Serious talks about the suit, which had seen little activity since fall 2023, began after Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s chief executive, flew to Trump&#39;s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to dine with him in November, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The dinner was one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the relationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump&#39;s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump warned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the election against him.</p><p> Toward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of the lawsuit, the people said. The president signaled that the litigation had to be resolved before Zuckerberg could be “brought into the tent,” one of the people said.</p></blockquote><p> A good reminder that self respect has no price tag.</p><blockquote><p> Weeks later, in early January, Zuckerberg returned to Mar-a-Lago for a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerberg-meta-trump-pivot-392e4a3f?mod=article_inline">full day of mediation</a> . Trump was present for part of the session, though he stepped out at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-sentencing-hush-money-new-york-9f9282bc?mod=article_inline">one point to be sentenced</a> — appearing virtually — for covering up hush money paid to a porn star, one of the people said. He also golfed, reappearing in golf clothes and talking about the round he had just played, the person said.</p></blockquote><p> Even when you own the golf course and <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/trump-drives-golf-cart-onto-green/">drive your cart right onto the green</a> like a jackass, an 18-hole round of golf still takes like three hours. I just love the idea of him leaving Zuckerberg sitting around for half a fucking day while he played a round of golf after his felony sentencing, before getting back to negotiating the price of the bribe to get “into the tent”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The WSJ on Zuckerberg’s $25 Million Payoff to Trump’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/wsj-suck-trump-payoff">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> One of These Lickspittle Tech Titans Is Not Like the Others </title><link href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-agrees-pay-25-million-settle-trump-lawsuit-rcna189918" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1q" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/zuckspittle" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41534</id><published> 2025-01-31T17:51:55Z</published><updated> 2025-01-31T17:51:56Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Via David Smith on Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113923389557198608">who writes</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The recent work I&#39;ve been doing has required a lot of sharing files between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the ideal tool for this but I&#39;ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p><p> Instead I&#39;ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop alternative and it&#39;s been working fantastically. The only real downside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the share to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that&#39;s a tradeoff I&#39;ll happily make.</p></blockquote><p> Somehow I&#39;d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It&#39;s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229">in the App Store</a> and <a href="https://localsend.org/download">via the web</a> . No middleman in the cloud — transfers are peer-to-peer, and the whole project is <a href="https://localsend.org/community">open source with an active community on GitHub</a> .</p><p> When I dick around with my Android burner phone, I often find myself sorely missing AirDrop and Continuity. Sometimes I just want to move the contents of my clipboard from one device to the other — LocalSend makes that easier than anything else I&#39;ve seen.</p><p> I&#39;m not even sure Smith&#39;s “downside” is really a downside. I understand why AirDrop works the way it does (always-on in the background), but I wouldn&#39;t want LocalSend to work that way. I <em>like</em> the explicitness of opening it on both devices.</p><p> Just an outstanding project from developer Tien Do Nam.

<p>苹果：</p><blockquote><p> Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter ended December 28, 2024. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10 percent year over year.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">Jason Snell (with his usual assortment of charts)</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Probably most notable is that iPhone revenue was down 1% from the year-ago quarter, which will certainly upset some analysts and investors, given that the iPhone is more than half of Apple&#39;s total revenue. But the Mac jumped 16%, the iPad was up 15%, and services was up 14%. The recently sluggish Wearables, Home, and Accessories category was down 2%.</p></blockquote><p> Sales were down 11 percent in China companywide, which is surely what pulled the iPhone down. Outside China iPhone 16 sales must be very strong.

<p>A Monday report from Reuters, syndicated at The Guardian, “Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, Trump Claims”:</p><blockquote><p> Donald Trump has suggested that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok and that he would like to see a bidding war over the app. When asked if Microsoft was in talks to buy the app, the US president said “I would say yes”, adding “A lot of interest in TikTok. There&#39;s great interest in TikTok.”</p><p> Microsoft, TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters&#39; requests for a comment outside regular business hours, after the US president&#39;s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday.</p><p> The reported talks mark the second time that Microsoft has been in the frame to acquire TikTok. During his first term, Trump ordered TikTok to separate its US version from ByteDance citing national security concerns. Microsoft emerged as a top bidder in 2020, but the talks soon collapsed, and Trump&#39;s divestment push ended a few months later when he left office.</p></blockquote><p> Is it really true that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok from ByteDance? Or did Donald Trump just bullshit his “I would say yes”? This report, based on nothing more than an off-the-cuff verbal answer from Trump Monday, has had absolutely zero follow-up since. Microsoft reported its quarterly earnings yesterday and there was not a word about a TikTok acquisition. And in the years since 2020, Microsoft has invested a staggering amount of capital into data centers for AI and cloud computing — their $22 billion spend last quarter and estimated $80 billion spend for the upcoming year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/microsoft-earnings-stock.html">dominated news coverage</a> and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">analysis</a> of their results yesterday. They also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">acquired Activision Blizzard</a> for about $70 billion. I&#39;m not saying Microsoft couldn&#39;t afford to acquire TikTok — they could, I&#39;m sure — but it&#39;d raise a genuine question about focus. But there&#39;s <em>nothing</em> <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250129/p34#a250129p34">in the coverage of yesterday&#39;s results</a> or the analyst call they held that suggests they&#39;re in the hunt for TikTok.</p><p> Whether you love Trump or hate him (or, bizarrely, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3lgw5kmagyc2f">somehow fall in-between</a> — please see me after class if you&#39;re of that mind) we all know he&#39;s a bullshitter. He makes shit up. Either (a) there are secret talks between Microsoft and ByteDance, and Trump is privy to those talks, and he decided to blab about them, but only when asked; or (b) he just said “I would say yes” when asked because he thought it would sound good and reinforce his self image as the world&#39;s most juiced-in dealmaker. I know which seems more likely.</p><p> And even if it&#39;s <em>not</em> bullshit, if all a news report has to go on is Donald Trump saying “I would say yes”, that <em>has</em> to be filed under “Maybe this is true” <em>at best</em> . So the headline, at its most generous, should put that first: “Trump Claims Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok”, not “Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, Trump Claims”.</p><p> Here&#39;s the kicker: Reuters&#39;s original headline, on reuters.com, actually got this right: “ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-microsoft-is-talks-acquire-tiktok-2025-01-28/">Trump Says Microsoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok</a> ”. It was someone at The Guardian who turned up the clickbait dial a tad on this.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘How to Write (and Read) Headlines in the Trump 2.0 Era, Microsoft-TikTok Edition’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/30/how-to-write-headlines-in-another-trump-era-microsoft-tiktok-edition">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> OpenStreetMap Community Discussion on How to Handle the US Federal Government&#39;s Imminent Designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the &#39;Gulf of America&#39; </title><link href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/29/open-street-map-gulf-of-mexico" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41530</id><published> 2025-01-29T22:46:51Z</published><updated> 2025-01-30T22:01:42Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Fascinating thread — and an almost entirely civil discussion of what has become, for obvious reasons, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">an inflammatory topic</a> . These are mapping and metadata nerds approaching the dilemma in the very nerdiest of ways. I found it rather soothing, and also quite informative — particularly the posts from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Minh%20Nguyen">Minh Nguyễn</a> , who seems to be an OpenStreetMap super user.<a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/55">第一的</a>：</p><blockquote><p> So it turns out the UNGEGN is not actually a decision-making authority on individual toponyms. Their role is to encourage and facilitate standardization. They literally issue <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/wgGuidelines.html">guidelines about guidelines</a> . The closest thing to an authority on the gulf&#39;s name <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265039137_The_Naming_of_Maritime_Features_Viewed_from_an_International_Law_Perspective">in international law</a> would be the International Hydrographic Organization. The IHO&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_Oceans_and_Seas"><em>Limits of Oceans and Seas</em></a> has been frozen in time without any updates since 1953, apparently because Japan and South Korea can&#39;t agree on a name for the sea separating them. Maybe a certain dealmaker can get them to the bargaining table…</p></blockquote><p> My kneejerk reaction to Trump&#39;s “Gulf of America” executive order was that mapmakers should just roll their eyes, make the jerk-off motion, and ignore it. But that&#39;s not practical. Mapmakers seek to appeal to authority on names. What&#39;s the alternative? That Google and Apple (and OpenStreetMaps) serve as their own authorities on the names of topographical features and geographical points of interest?那是不对的。 So you might think, well, the Gulf of Mexico is an international body of water, so the mapmakers should appeal to an international authority. The UN! But as Nguyễn cites, that&#39;s not what the UN&#39;s Group of Experts on Geographical Names does.</p><p> <a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/87">Another post in the thread from Nguyễn</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Ironically, Spanish-language media <a href="https://elpais.com/us/2025-01-21/de-golfo-de-mexico-a-golfo-de-america-trump-renombra-el-mapa-aunque-con-improbables-consecuencias-internacionales.html/">keeps having to explain</a> why <em>Gulf of America</em> is problematic in English. In Spanish, <em>América</em> refers to the Americas as a whole, not the US specifically. If one didn&#39;t know any better, one would think it&#39;s a gift to Cuba! Of course, this doesn&#39;t justify the attempt to rename the gulf, since the intention is abundantly clear, but it does leave the name vulnerable to others reclaiming it for themselves. A more erudite politician might&#39;ve chosen <em>Gulf of Florida</em> , which at least has a historical basis, dating to around the same time as <em>Gulf of Mexico</em> .但是我们在这里。</p></blockquote><p> And from yet another post by Nguyễn, a link to <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12881">this new report on the order&#39;s implications for the entire federal government</a> from the Congressional Research Service (a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress). Now we&#39;ve gotten more good nerds involved: librarians. And whatever the answer is, it&#39;s complicated.</p><p> I don&#39;t like this ostensible renaming (rebranding?) of the Gulf of Mexico any more than you do. It&#39;s petty and pointless, except for the trolling spite, which, of course, <em>is</em> the point. I don&#39;t know what Apple is going to do, but I suspect, ultimately, if the Department of the Interior really does make this official, Apple Maps will follow suit, but perhaps with something like “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” for users in the US.</p><p> Google should have simply done what Apple is doing, though, and remained utterly silent on the issue until and if it&#39;s actually made official. Best thing we can hope for is that the Department of the Interior stalls on making the change in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and that Trump forgets about it by then.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘OpenStreetMap Community Discussion on How to Handle the U.S. Federal Government’s Imminent Designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘Gulf of America’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/29/open-street-map-gulf-of-mexico">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to &#39;Gulf of America&#39;, for American Users Only </title><link href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41526</id><published> 2025-01-29T01:00:22Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T22:12:57Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Google, in an announcement on X:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.</p><p> For geographic features in the US, this is when <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) is updated. When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the US quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.</p><p> Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-reclassifies-us-as-sensitive-country-like-china-russia-.html">Jennifer Elias, reporting for CNBC</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Google&#39;s maps division on Monday reclassified the US as a “sensitive country,” a designation it reserves for states with strict governments and border disputes, CNBC has learned. [...]</p><p> Some team members within the maps division were ordered to urgently make changes to the location name and recategorize the US from “non-sensitive” to “sensitive,” according to the internal correspondence. The changes were given a rare “P0” order, meaning it had the highest priority level and employees were immediately notified and instructed to drop what they were doing to work on it.</p><p> Google&#39;s order states that the Gulf of America title change should be treated similar to the Persian Gulf, which in Arab countries is displayed on Google Maps as Arabian Gulf.</p></blockquote><p> No word from Apple on how Apple Maps will handle this. (I&#39;ve asked for comment; will update if I get an answer.) Re-renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley seems like a no-brainer for the maps to comply with. A country names its own mountains. If Obama could rename it, Trump can re-rename it.</p><p> The Gulf of Mexico, though, is an international body of water, and its name wasn&#39;t even debated until Trump started talking about it a few weeks ago. Google (and perhaps Apple) having a policy where they simply follow the naming conventions of the GNIS seems not merely sensible but utterly uncontroversial ... until now.</p><p> There are three countries in the world that don&#39;t use the metric system as their official units of measure: the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar. I expect there will be fewer — namely, one — who go along with calling it the “Gulf of America”.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to ‘Gulf of America’, for American Users Only’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Are Both Out </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-now-available-new-features/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-macos-15-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41523</id><published> 2025-01-28T19:26:02Z</published><updated> 2025-01-29T00:26:11Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jim Acosta, signing off from CNN for the final time:</p><blockquote><p> It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant. I believe it is the job of the press to hold power to account — I&#39;ve always tried to do that here at CNN, and I plan on doing all of that again in the future.</p><p> One final message: Don&#39;t give in to the lies. Don&#39;t give in to the fear. Hold on to the truth, and hope.</p></blockquote><p> President Trump, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113906705175756002">gloating</a> on his very popular social network, Truth Social (current ranking in the App Store: not in the top 200 free downloads, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/truth-social-app-store-2025-01-28.png">#20 in Social Networking</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Wow, really good news! Jim Acosta, one of the worst and most dishonest reporters in journalistic history, a major sleazebag, has been relegated by CNN Fake News to the Midnight hour, “Death Valley,” because of extraordinarily BAD RATINGS (and no talent!). Word is that he wants to QUIT, and that would be even better. Jim is a major loser who will fail no matter where he ends up. Good luck Jim!</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@aaron.rupar/post/DFIpGsKgXdb">Here&#39;s a recent example of Acosta&#39;s exemplary work on CNN</a> , interviewing Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee:</p><blockquote><p> ACOSTA: Do you agree with Trump&#39;s decision to pardon violent people?</p><p>代表。 BURCHETT: If they were truly violent, no. But I don&#39;t know that?</p><p> ACOSTA: What do you mean you don&#39;t know? We&#39;re showing the footage right now.</p></blockquote><p> Oliver Darcy, the former CNN media reporter now working under his own umbrella at Status, has been all over the abject cowardice of CNN&#39;s current chief executive, Mark Thompson:</p><blockquote><p> The anchor, I&#39;m told, signaled to associates in private conversations over the weekend that he intends to depart the network after its chief executive, Mark Thompson, booted him from the morning programming lineup — a move that conspicuously coincided with Donald Trump&#39;s return to力量。</p><p> CNN brass, <a href="https://www.status.news/p/jim-acosta-cnn-mark-thompson-midnight-offer">as we first reported earlier this month</a> , decided to strip Acosta of his 10am show, which he has anchored to great ratings success over the last 11 months, at times even seeing higher viewership than programs in the channel&#39;s prime time bloc.</p><p> Acosta was instead offered the less-than-desirable option of anchoring a show from midnight until 2am ET.</p><p> CNN pitched the gig to Acosta as anchoring during prime time on the West Coast and said he could move to Los Angeles to host the program. But the reality is the program would have aired at a time in which cable news viewership is at its lowest levels.</p></blockquote><p> Acosta&#39;s morning ratings were high, not low. There&#39;s no explanation for CNN forcing him to midnight other than appeasement of a president who spends his days obsessing over cable news.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Jim Acosta, Reporter and Anchor Despised by Trump, Was Pushed Out of CNN’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/acosta-out-at-cnn">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w1d" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/01/protect_your_app_with_workos_r_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41521</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-01-28T02:19:56Z</published><updated> 2025-01-28T02:19:56Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
