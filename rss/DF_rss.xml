<p>谈到 Twitter/X，Eric Seufert 在 Threads 上写道：</p><blockquote><p>自从该应用程序更名为 X 以来，Twitter 在两个平台的下载排行榜上的位置都急剧下降。为什么？这种情况在品牌资产和移动平台动态的交叉点上提供了一个有趣的案例研究。</p><p>这个案例在某种程度上是史无前例的：Twitter 在近 20 年的时间里建立了一个无处不在的家喻户晓的品牌，然后干脆放弃了它，让它被竞争对手通过移动平台的品牌搜索广告毫无抵抗地利用。 [...]</p><p>我的假设是，虽然终端在线用户完全意识到 Twitter 重新命名为 X，但大多数消费者却没有意识到，而且他们在平台商店中搜索“Twitter”时会看到广告和真实的搜索结果，而这些广告和真实的搜索结果与 Twitter 毫无关联。</p></blockquote><p>因此，如果您不知道 Twitter 已更名为 X，并且搜索“Twitter”，则最上面的结果是来自竞争对手（Snapchat、Facebook、Instagram 等）的付费广告，而 X 的结果则不会。看起来一点也不像Twitter。它没有名字，没有说“以前是 Twitter”，甚至不是蓝色的。只是<a href="https://www.threads.net/@joannastern/post/CwAxVOGL8Cz/">丑陋的X图标</a>和平淡的口号“燃烧你的荣耀！”</p><p>目前，Threads 在 App Store 免费下载排行榜上排名第 2，X 排名第 51。在 Play 商店中，Threads 为 #6，X 为（<em>滚动、滚动、滚动...</em> ）#66。如果其背后的策划者不是该公司的所有者，那么这次品牌重塑将被解雇。 （对于 Threads 来说就这么多了，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/nobody_uses_threads_anymore">据说它是在喘气</a>。）</p><div> <a  title="指向“更改名称 Tanked X 在 App Store 和 Play Store 中的下载”的永久链接"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/seufert-x-downloads">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>亚马逊取消《外围》第二季</title><link href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-canceled-amazon-season-2-renewal-1235700019/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/amazon-peripheral-season-2" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40187</id><published> 2023-08-20T00:00:29Z</published><updated> 2023-08-20T00:03:49Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>乔·奥特森 (Joe Otterson) 为 Variety 报道了当天最糟糕的新闻：</p><blockquote><p>据 Variety 报道，亚马逊 Prime Video 的《 <a href="https://variety.com/t/the-peripheral/">The Peripheral</a> 》已被取消。尽管亚马逊早在二月份<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-renewed-season-2-amazon-1235518073/">就续订了该剧第二季，但</a>这个消息还是传来了。该剧改编自威廉·吉布森的同名小说，于 2022 年 10 月 21 日在亚马逊首发。</p><p>该片由科洛·莫瑞兹主演，执行制片人丽莎·乔伊和乔纳森·诺兰与亚马逊签订了丰厚的整体协议。据一位知情人士透露，不再继续拍摄第二季的决定在很大程度上是受到正在进行的编剧和演员罢工的影响。从本质上讲，即使该剧很快重新投入制作，第二季也要到接近 2025 年才能播出。 [...]</p><p> 《外围》是诺兰和乔伊与亚马逊签订的协议下首映的系列剧，据报道价值 1.5 亿美元。两人还在准备基于视频游戏《辐射》系列的系列，尽管该项目尚未确定首播日期。据报道，该系列剧的制作已于今年早些时候完成。</p></blockquote><p>这太糟糕了。 <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-Season-1/dp/B0B8TFMYXZ">《外围》</a></em>第一季真的很棒：聪明、有趣、令人惊讶、人物和演员阵容都很棒。看起来也不错。诺兰和乔伊是 HBO 的<em>《西部世界》的</em>幕后团队， <em>《外围》</em>在风格和主题上都很相似，但只是更好。这就像诺兰和乔伊对同一件事进行了又一次尝试。太好了，我建议即使知道没有未来也看它，因此结局非常不令人满意。</p><p>我很生气 Netflix 在播出一季后就放弃了<em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80214497">《1899》</a></em> ，但知道<em>《1899》</em>没有未来，我有点不太愿意建议观看它——它远不如<em>《外围》</em>那么好。但我们都已经<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">习惯了 Netflix 的这一点</a>。很遗憾看到亚马逊走这条路。</p><p>我根本不明白编剧和演员的罢工如何证明这个决定是合理的——<em>一切</em>都会因为这些罢工而推迟。这看起来就像是亚马逊在一部糟糕的<em>《指环王</em>》和一部昂贵的、令人失望的<em>《城堡》</em>上<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-05/amazon-ceo-asks-his-hollywood-studio-to-explain-its-big-spending?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=aPhxMSeh">花费了数十亿美元之后变得便宜了</a>。一家不致力于像<em>The Peripheral</em>这样出色的节目的公司应该退出这个行业。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“亚马逊在‘外围’第 2 季中大败”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/amazon-peripheral-season-2">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>每天喊“狼来了”的小马斯克声称 X 将“删除”区块功能，但没人知道这意味着什么</title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/18/23837494/elon-musk-twitter-x-remove-blocking" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0a" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40186</id><published> 2023-08-19T23:16:48Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T23:16:49Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>阿迪·罗伯逊 (Adi Robertson)，The Verge 报道：</p><blockquote><p>埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 表示，X 的（前 Twitter 的）区块功能即将被砍掉，重申了他长期以来对基本社交网络功能的不满。 “区块将作为一项‘功能’被删除，除了 DM，”马斯克<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558414105186796">在周五的 X 回复中表示</a>。他随后又发了<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558493255942213">一条帖子</a>：“这毫无意义。”</p></blockquote><p> Twitter 创始人兼多任前首席执行官<a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1692583743884509668">杰克·多西</a>（Jack Dorsey）（大写原文<em>如此</em>）：“💯。只能静音。”</p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety">苹果应用商店指南</a>：</p><blockquote><p> 1.2 用户生成的内容</p><p>包含用户生成内容的应用程序带来了特殊的挑战，从知识产权侵权到匿名欺凌。为了防止滥用，具有用户生成内容或社交网络服务的应用程序必须包括：</p><ul><li>一种过滤令人反感的材料以免发布到应用程序的方法</li><li>报告攻击性内容并及时回应问题的机制</li><li>阻止滥用服务的用户的能力</li></ul></blockquote><p>摘自<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9876937?hl=en">Google Play 商店政策中心有关“用户生成内容”的内容</a>：</p><blockquote><p>包含或具有 UGC 功能的应用程序（包括将用户引导至 UGC 平台的专用浏览器或客户端的应用程序）必须实施稳健、有效和持续的 UGC 审核：</p><ul><li>进行 UGC 审核，合理且与应用托管的 UGC 类型一致； [...]</li><li>提供应用内系统来报告令人反感的 UGC 和用户，并在适当的情况下对该 UGC 和/或用户采取行动；</li><li>提供应用内系统来屏蔽UGC和用户；</li></ul></blockquote><p>因此，这两个平台都需要社交媒体应用程序来支持用户阻止其他用户。谷歌的语言是明确的。问题在于“阻塞”的定义。如果马斯克想做的只是改变屏蔽，让被屏蔽的用户仍然可以<em>看到</em>屏蔽他们的用户的推文，但不能与他们互动（回复、引用、转发），我认为那很好。被阻止的用户只需打开一个私人/隐身浏览器选项卡即可看到这些推文。但如果马斯克想要真正“删除”屏蔽功能，他将直接遭遇苹果和谷歌的应用商店规则。在执行 UGC 规则方面，谷歌可以说比苹果更严格，<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1129024148/google-truth-social-trump">几个月来，谷歌一直将唐纳德·特朗普的 Truth Social 应用程序排除在 Play 商店之外</a>（在苹果应用程序商店提供该应用程序之后），理由是内容审核不足。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“小马斯克喊‘狼来了’，每日声称X将‘删除’区块功能，但没人知道这意味着什么”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>特朗普认为福克斯新闻让他看起来又胖又橙</title><link href="https://politicalwire.com/2023/08/17/trump-thinks-fox-news-makes-him-look-fat-and-orange/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v09" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/trump-fat-orange" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40185</id><published> 2023-08-19T21:55:22Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T21:55:23Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>马克·古尔曼 (Mark Gurman) 上周在彭博社的 Power On 专栏中说道：</p><blockquote><p>由于 Apple Watch 多年来发展缓慢，自 2018 年推出 Series 4 以来，除了 Ultra 型号外，其设计基本保持不变。</p></blockquote><p>这里的因果关系是倒退的：Apple Watch 发展缓慢是因为最初的设计非常完美。 Series 4 的外形尺寸发生了轻微的变化，但乍一看，今天的 Series 8（几乎可以肯定，下个月的 Series 9）看起来与最初的“Series 0”型号几乎相同。人们对最初的 Apple Watch 设计的出色程度几乎被低估了。 1993 年的 Mac 看起来并不像 1984 年的初代 Macintosh，除了花哨的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Color_Classic">Color Classic</a>之外，当时几乎没有人购买，现在记住的人就更少了。 iPhone 在其第一个十年中经历了多次重大的外形修改：iPhone 4、5、6 和 X。然而，我们现在正处于第 9 代 Apple Watch 的风口浪尖，最初的设计看起来仍然很新鲜，并且仍然与 Apple Watch 兼容。原始型号。但是，古尔曼说：</p><blockquote><p>但这种情况即将改变。苹果正在计划推出“Watch X”型号来纪念该设备十周年，这有望成为迄今为止最大的一次革新。 （该类别于 2014 年推出，并于次年发布，因此 Apple 计划在 2024 年或 2025 年推出 Watch X。）通过 X 型号，Apple 设计师正在研究更薄的表壳，并探索改变表带的方式连接到设备。</p><p>从最初的 Apple Watch 开始，表带滑入底盘的侧面并通过锁定机构连接。保持这种设计相同可以让表带与新旧型号保持兼容，但它也有缺点。参与新款苹果手表开发的人士表示，该系统占用了相当大的空间，可以用更大的电池或其他组件来更好地填充。</p><p>为此，该公司探索了一种新的磁带连接系统，但尚不清楚它是否会准备好或用于 Watch X 的改造。更大的变化也即将到来：microLED 显示屏的色彩和清晰度超越了当前 OLED 屏幕，以及血压监测技术。</p></blockquote><p>当然，表带连接器<em>最终</em>会破坏向后兼容性，但值得注意的是，即使是 Apple Watch Ultra 也与常规的“大型”Apple Watch 兼容。</p><p>如果苹果用“X”代替“10”，<em>就像 iPhone X 那样</em>，我仍然会押注在“Series X”上，而不仅仅是“X”。我们可以向银行告知，这一切都会发生，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">就像 Gurman</a>在 2021 年<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/29/apple-watch-series-7-size-faces-report/">宣布之前两周</a>报道的那样，Series 7 将拥有平面显示屏和平面外壳。 （事实上​​，Series 7 手表的显示屏<em>更圆</em>，表壳的曲率没有丝毫改变。）</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“他一生都将目光移向未来、地平线”。他从来不关心自己在哪里。他在做什么。下个月将会发布什么。”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/gurman-watch-series-x">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>表带变脏，头条新闻成为标题党</title><link href="https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=125218" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v07" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/watch-bands-get-dirty" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40183</id><published> 2023-08-19T17:17:07Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T17:17:08Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>摘自佛罗里达大西洋大学研究人员在《传染病进展》上发表的一份报告《与各种类型腕带相关的细菌的流行和消毒》：</p><blockquote><p>腕带经常每天佩戴而没有定期清洁，可能会积聚潜在的致病细菌。然而，本实验中在腕带上发现的细菌的数量和分类表明，需要对这些表面进行定期和普遍的卫生处理。一般来说，橡胶和塑料腕带的细菌数量较高，而金属腕带，尤其是金银腕带，几乎没有细菌。发现的细菌是常见的皮肤居民，如葡萄球菌属和假单胞菌属，以及肠道共生菌，如埃希氏菌属。许多这些细菌能够显着影响免疫功能低下宿主的健康，这表明医护人员和医院环境中的其他人特别需要定期对这些表面进行消毒。常见的家用消毒剂，如来苏尔消毒喷雾、70% 乙醇和亨氏苹果醋，都被证明对所有材料（橡胶、塑料、布料和金属）至少有一定的效果，尽管与传统消毒剂相比，两分钟后抗菌效果显着增强。三十秒。</p></blockquote><p> “Apple”在报告中出现了14次；所有 14 条内容都提到使用苹果醋作为清洁剂。然而《纽约邮报》是这样报道的：“ <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/17/apple-watch-fitbit-wristbands-carry-shocking-levels-of-bacteria-experts/">Apple Watch、Fitbit 腕带携带的细菌数量令人震惊：专家</a>”。然后 9to5Mac 则将这一独家新闻归功于《华盛顿邮报》：“<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/18/apple-watch-bands-bacteria-cleaning-study/">新研究表明，你的 Apple Watch 表带很可能被细菌覆盖</a>”。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“表带变脏，头条新闻被点击诱骗”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/watch-bands-get-dirty">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> “数字上升” </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-08-17/my-crypto-hell-journey-started-with-a-wrong-number-scam-text" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v06" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/18/number-go-up" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40182</id><published> 2023-08-18T15:21:13Z</published><updated> 2023-08-18T15:45:30Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>我的<a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>联合主持人 Ben Thompson 在本周的<a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/disneys-taylor-swift-era/">一篇（非常好的）Stratechery 帖子</a>中引用了<a href="https://kottke.org/15/06/walt-disneys-corporate-strategy-chart">这张著名的 1957 年迪士尼组织/战略图表</a>。我刚刚在昨天的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree">迪士尼/苹果文章</a>中有关公司组织结构图的脚注中添加了一个链接，但感觉值得单独写一篇文章。</p><p> 1957 年的榜单中，迪士尼业务的核心是院线电影。其他一切——电视、音乐、杂志和漫画，以及当时新成立的迪士尼乐园——都融入并围绕着戏剧电影。</p><p>不太为人所知的是<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthunterross/7973803710/in/pool-978039@N25/">1967 年的修订版</a>。或者至少我不太了解——今天之前我从未见过它。沃尔特·迪士尼 (Walt Disney) 于 1966 年去世，因此这张图表反映了他离开时的公司情况。与 1957 年的图表相比，令我印象深刻的差异是：</p><ul><li><p>迪士尼乐园更接近公司的核心，其中心地位几乎可以与电影制片厂相媲美。</p></li><li><p> “佛罗里达迪士尼世界”隐藏在角落里，但直到 1971 年 10 月才开业。趋势很明显：主题公园（包括最终的<a href="https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/">浮动公园</a><sup id="fnr1-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-17">1</a></sup> ）将取代电影成为公司的核心。</p></li><li><p>我不熟悉的是一个名为“矿物王”的盒子，上面画着一个滑雪的高飞。<a href="https://yesterland.com/mineralking.html">原来，这是加利福尼亚州红杉国家森林中的一个滑雪胜地</a>，国家林务局于 1965 年授予了土地使用权。十年来，迪士尼卷入了无趣的塞拉俱乐部的诉讼，最终于 1976 年放弃了该项目。</p></li><li><p>在两个图表中，“连环漫画”与“出版物”是分开列出的。我已经足够大了，可以记得每天阅读报纸漫画版，但还不足以记得米奇和朋友们什么时候在看漫画。在电视出现之前，每日报纸漫画填补了当今社交媒体的角色：一种免费的方式让每个人都可以享受小块的娱乐。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-17">2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p>最后，WED Enterprises（又名 Imagineering）是 1967 年排行榜的重要组成部分，但甚至没有出现在 1957 年的排行榜上。 [<strong>更新：</strong> WED 是一家由 Walt 个人拥有的私人公司，直到 1965 年，这解释了它在 1957 年迪士尼公司图表中被遗漏的原因。] 迪士尼曾经是而且应该继续是一家严肃的工程公司。 1967 年，WED 工程师创造了从主题公园电子动画到交通系统的各种产品。听起来<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">很熟悉</a>。艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 的格言是这样的：“预测未来的最好方法就是发明它。”此外，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/apple-micro-led-cook-doctrine">库克主义</a>：“我们相信我们需要拥有并控制我们制造的产品背后的主要技术。”</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-17"><p>迪士尼<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">主题</a><a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/">公园</a>和<a href="https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/">游轮</a>网站仍然是 go.com 的子域，这有点奇怪。更不用说根级<a href="http://go.com/">go.com 网站</a>非常简陋，甚至不使用 HTTPS 提供服务。迪士尼的 go.com 域名是 20 世纪 90 年代末“门户网站”热潮的遗迹，但迪士尼<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2590562/disney-to-stop-go-com.html">在 2001 年放弃了该门户网站本身</a>。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-17"><p> 1930 年 10 月，在连续几十年的连载中，距离米奇在<em>《威利汽船》</em>中首次亮相仅两年后，就在该连环漫画开始时，出现了一个长达一周的诡异黑暗的故事情节<a href="https://www.retroist.com/p/mickey-mouse-suicide">，每天的笑料都是米奇试图自杀，</a>因为米妮离开了他。另一只老鼠。吉米尼。 <a href="#fnr2-2023-08-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 华特迪士尼世纪中叶商业战略图表</title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v04" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40180</id><published> 2023-08-17T03:59:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T01:08:58Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我认为苹果没有这样的兴趣或胃口。我也不认为迪士尼对自己的未来有任何设想，只是自华特·迪士尼和罗伊·迪士尼 100 年前创立迪士尼兄弟卡通工作室以来，它一直是一家独立的公司。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>金·马斯特斯 (Kim Masters) 和亚历克斯·韦普林 (Alex Weprin) 为《好莱坞报道》撰写文章，标题为“<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-apple-deal-1235559416/">迪士尼向苹果出售产品？这次别指望了</a>”：</p><blockquote><p>显然没有像苹果这样的买家，该公司坐拥 620 亿美元现金和现金等价物，市值达 2.8 万亿美元。虽然苹果确实不想购买<em>工作室</em>，但也许它会想要购买<em>这个</em>工作室——尽管目前面临挑战，但它拥有充满无价知识产权的金库，并且仍然是最有价值的工作室。娱乐领域的品牌。</p><p>迪士尼和苹果之间有着长期的“特殊关系”：史蒂夫·乔布斯从 2006 年起一直在迪士尼董事会任职，直到 2011 年去世。艾格在乔布斯去世后不久就加入了苹果董事会。他于 2019 年 9 月 10 日辞去该职务，同一天苹果正式宣布将通过 Apple TV+ 服务进军内容业务。</p></blockquote><p>我认为苹果没有兴趣收购迪士尼。苹果经常收购小公司——平均<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56178792">每月一次</a>。其中许多收购都非常安静，没有得到任何媒体报道，而这正是苹果所喜欢的。当<em>提到</em>收购时，该公司<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q="Apple+buys+smaller+technology+companies+from+time+to+time,+and+we+generally+do+not+discuss+our+purpose+or+plans"&amp;ia=web">有一个样板回应</a>：“苹果有时会收购规模较小的科技公司，我们通常不会讨论我们的目的或计划。”如果他们购买迪士尼，他们将需要一份更长的声明。</p><p>当然，Beats 是个例外。 <a href="#fn3-2023-08-16">2014 年，这笔收购金额达 30 亿美元</a>，仍然是苹果迄今为止规模最大的收购案。迪士尼目前的市值为<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=DIS+market+cap+on+15+august+2023">1580亿美元</a>。我绝不是说苹果买不起迪士尼，即使加价幅度很大，但像这样的大规模行业洗牌收购不是苹果所做的，在我看来，也不应该做。苹果拥有非常独特的公司文化和重点。苹果公司在 2008 年以 2.78 亿美元的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/04/23/pa-semi">价格</a>收购了 PA Semi，这也是苹果公司的收购风格。苹果不像微软 1 那样由部门领地组成，微软<sup id="fnr1-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-16">1</a></sup> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/microsoft-activision-agree-to-extend-deal-deadline-to-oct-18.html">以 690 亿美元收购了动视暴雪 (Activision)</a> ，亚马逊也以<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/how-whole-foods-has-changed-in-the-five-years-since-amazon-took-over.html">140 亿美元收购了 Whole Foods</a> ，从而进入了杂货店市场。马努·科内特 (Manu Cornet <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/organizational-charts">) 2011 年的经典漫画描绘了科技公司的组织结构图，它</a>仍然很贴切，而且有趣只是因为它是准确的。 <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-16">2</a></sup></p><p>迪士尼也有非常独特的公司文化和重点。迪士尼和苹果的文化有一些明显的重叠之处：它们都是适合家庭的标志性品牌，具有巨大的文化影响力，并以行业领先的设计和工程而享有盛誉。每个公司做什么，他们都力求做到<em>最好</em>。由于他们将质量放在首位，因此两家公司都建立了庞大的忠实客户群，这些客户群实际上更像是<em>粉丝</em>群。苹果-迪士尼收购的想法之所以有道理，是因为它并不疯狂。如果苹果<em>要</em>收购一家大型娱乐/媒体公司，他们可能会想要迪士尼。当你买得起唐培里侬香槟时，为什么还要喝凯歌香槟呢？既然要买，就买最好的。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-16">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnr4-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn4-2023-08-16">4</a></sup></p><p>如果迪士尼要寻找买家，除了苹果之外，我想不出还有哪家公司<em>愿意</em>卖给它。 <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-disney-stock-brand-snow-white-mickey-2022-2">伯克希尔哈撒韦公司</a>是我能想到的唯一一家可以信任让迪士尼成为迪士尼的足够大的公司。但<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/">伯克希尔今天根本没有持有迪士尼股票</a>，这强烈表明沃伦·巴菲特没有兴趣以当前价格购买整个公司。不过，伯克希尔哈撒韦公司确实拥有苹果公司 6% 的股票， <sup id="fnr5-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn5-2023-08-16">5</a></sup>因此，如果苹果公司收购了迪士尼，他们将通过代理拥有迪士尼的相当大的股份。</p><p>我只是认为苹果没有这样的兴趣或胃口。我也不认为迪士尼对自己的未来抱有任何期望，但自 100 年前华特·迪士尼 (Walt Disney) 和罗伊·迪士尼 (Roy Disney) 创立迪士尼兄弟卡通工作室以来，它一直是一家独立的公司。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-16"><p>微软和苹果都以其创始人的形象塑造而成，长期以来在许多方面都是对立的。他们在大型收购方面的截然不同的策略就证明了这一点。<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft">微软已经进行了八项收购，规模超过了苹果 30 亿美元收购 Beats 的规模</a>（所有价格均以十亿美元为单位）：动视暴雪（69 美元）、LinkedIn（26 美元）、Nuance（20 美元）、Skype（8.5 美元）、ZeniMax（8.1 美元）、GitHub（7.5 美元） 、诺基亚（7.2 美元）和 aQuantive（6.3 美元）。我什至愿意以 25 亿美元的价格买入 Minecraft 制作商 Mojang，这仅低于苹果为 Beats 支付的价格。微软会考虑收购迪士尼吗？我认为他们可能会这么做，特别是如果迪士尼的股价进一步下跌的话。 （让我们先把这样的交易显然会面临的监管障碍放在一边——微软似乎很喜欢这样的战斗。）当然，微软在游戏领域很强大，但在苹果、亚马逊和谷歌中独树一帜，在流媒体视频领域没有立足之地。迪士尼会考虑将自己出售给微软吗？我当然希望不会。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注

id="fn4-2023-08-16"><p>好吧，这是一个多年来的假设：如果苹果而不是迪士尼收购了皮克斯怎么办？实际上，从时间上来说，这似乎是不可能的。 2006 年 1 月，也就是 iPhone 发布的整整一年前，迪士尼以 74 亿美元的价格收购了皮克斯。当时苹果公司已经蓬勃发展——Mac 已经完成了从经典 Mac OS 到 Mac OS X 的软件过渡，并开始从 PowerPC 到 Intel 的硬件过渡； iPod 引起了文化轰动并大受欢迎；事实证明，该公司进军自己的零售店是一个<em>非常</em>明智的决定。但苹果在 2006 年左右<em>以 74 亿美元收购另一家公司</em>并没有蓬勃发展。 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/10/11Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results/">2005 年 10 月，苹果公司宣布了其当时最好的财政年度</a>：收入 140 亿美元，利润 13 亿美元。相比之下， <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/10/amid-tech-industry-fears-apple-reports-record-q4-results/">苹果 2022 财年</a>的收入为 3160 亿美元，利润平稳为 1000 亿美元。如今，苹果公司每 5 天创造的利润就比 2006 年全年还要多。 2006 年 1 月苹果公司的市值：600 亿美元。今天：3万亿美元。</p><p>更不用说苹果在2006年收购皮克斯并无战略理由。Apple TV+直到2019年才推出。iTunes Store甚至<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/188954/itunesrent.html">直到2008年</a>才开始租赁电影。至少可以说，乔布斯将皮克斯（他以卖给迪士尼的价格持有皮克斯超过 10 亿美元的股票）卖给苹果公司会显得很可疑。更不用说迪士尼对皮克斯拥有独特的影响力，可以将自己出售给其他潜在的追求者——迪士尼并不拥有皮克斯，但他们确实拥有皮克斯迄今为止制作的所有电影的知识产权： <em>《玩具总动员》</em> 、 <em>《虫虫奇缘》 《Life》</em> 、 <em>《怪兽电力公司》</em> 、 <em>《海底总动员</em>》、 <em>《超人总动员》</em>以及即将上映的<em>《赛车总动员</em>》、 <em>《料理鼠王》</em> 、 <em>《瓦力</em>》和《<em>飞屋环游记》</em> 。购买皮克斯而不获得这些权利就像今天购买迪士尼而不购买米老鼠、白雪公主、星球大战和漫威一样。</p><p>但如果我们抛开所有不方便的历史时间，今天很容易将皮克斯想象为苹果公司的一家电影工作室（ <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/pixar-adobe-apple-autodesk-and-nvidia-form-alliance-for-openusd/">和工程</a>）子公司。这将是完美的文化和战略契合。 <a href="#fnr4-2023-08-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"

<p>Clark Neily, writing for Cato:</p><blockquote><p> America has seen its fair share of lying politicians, but Donald Trump is in a class of his own. He appears to view literally any interaction with another human being as an opportunity to be exploited and a game to be won. In Trump&#39;s world, rules are for chumps, norms are for losers, and the truth is whatever you can get another person to believe — nothing more. And of course, history makes clear that this approach has been quite effective at advancing Trump&#39;s interests in certain settings — preening on the set of a game show, for example, or spinning up a fawning, frothing crowd at a campaign event.</p><p> But not only will those antics not work in a courtroom, they will backfire. Given the nature of the allegations against him, Trump will <em>have</em> to take the stand even though he has a right not to, and given <em>his</em> nature, he will lie to the jury just like he has lied to everyone else his entire life.</p></blockquote><p> Nothing new in that description, of course, but as Josh Marshall notes, it&#39;s a “tight and concise run-through”.<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/how-not-to-fall-for-trumps-what-he-believes-nonsense">Marshall adds</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I note this because Trump&#39;s press conference seems to presage a new and insipid public debate about what Donald Trump <em>really</em> believes. We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t note that it&#39;s actually irrelevant what Trump believes. Believing the bank owes you money isn&#39;t a defense for robbing the bank. But that&#39;s not the core point. Trump&#39;s current antics are like a liar&#39;s version of a fake insanity defense in which the defendant makes a spectacle of bizarre behavior to prove his case. Surely, we&#39;re supposed be thinking, or rather doubting, he wouldn&#39;t go back to the well, provide yet more evidence for the prosecution, unless he somehow truly believe this stuff.</p><p> But Trump doesn&#39;t think of truth or lies the way you or I do. Most imperfect people, which is to say all of us, exist in a tension between what we believe is true and what is good for or pleasing to us. If we have strong character we hew closely to the former, both in what we say to others and what we say to ourselves. The key to understanding Trump is that it&#39;s not that he hews toward the latter. It&#39;s that the tension doesn&#39;t exist. What he says is simply what works for him.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Trump’s Toast, Folks’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/trumps-toast">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> 25th Anniversary of the iMac </title><link href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-jobs-unveils-imac-169734" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v02" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40178</id><published> 2023-08-16T20:48:42Z</published><updated> 2023-08-20T01:00:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Steven Levy, in a 1998 profile for Newsweek that holds up startlingly well:</p><blockquote><p> “Look at that!” says Steve Jobs as he pulls his Mercedes into a parking space. He&#39;s pointing at a new Volkswagen Beetle, and as soon as he parks, he dashes over, circling the shiny black Bug, taking the measure of a well-publicized update of once great product design. “They got it right,” he concludes.</p><p> Last Wednesday Jobs himself received a more thunderous thumbs-up at the announcement of Apple Computer&#39;s successor to its own hall-of-fame classic, the original Macintosh: a machine designed for consumers dubbed the iMac (only Apple would dare to lowercase the “I” in Internet). The crowd in Cupertino, Calif.&#39;s Flint Center — site of the historic Mac launch 14 years ago — largely consisted of Apple employees. But due to an industrial-strength cone of silence shrouding the new product, few had been aware of its existence. So after a morale-boosting slide show documenting the company&#39;s new profits, and a demonstration of the speed of its sleek new laptops, the crowd went bonkers when interim CEO Jobs, in a rare appearance in a business suit, literally unveiled a piece of hardware that blends sci-fi shimmer with the kitsch whimsy of a cocktail umbrella. As distinctively curvy as the Beetle, dressed in retro-geeky, translucent plastic, the iMac (due to ship in August) is not only the coolest-looking computer introduced in years, but a chest-thumping statement that Silicon Valley&#39;s original dream company is no longer somnambulant.</p></blockquote><p> That first iMac shipped 25 years ago this week. No amount of praise heaped upon it is sufficient. It reestablished the Mac platform, and paved the way for <em>everything</em> the entire company has since accomplished. (The Macintosh platform was younger then (14) than the iPhone is today (16), an observation that I find rather upsetting.)</p><p> This line from Larry Ellison, then an Apple board member, at the invitation of Jobs, defines Apple as much as it does Jobs personally:</p><blockquote><p> Yes, his demeanor can be alarmingly frank — he can sometimes glance at an employee&#39;s hard-won accomplishment and sneer, “This is a &#39;D&#39;.” But critics who focus on the brutality of his assessments miss the point: Jobs&#39;s verbal boot camp can catalyze previously untapped greatness. “There&#39;s too much emphasis on this style issue,” says Larry Ellison. “Steve is obsessed with quality, and that can make him uncompromising, but he gets results.”</p></blockquote><p> As Jobs himself would <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/20/design-is-how-it-works">soon say</a> , “Design is how it works.” The original iMac exemplifies that. Yes, everyone noticed first what it <em>looked</em> like. But it was an insanely great computer.</p><p> <strong>See Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808948/imac-twenty-five-visual-history-apple-design-models">Umar Shakir&#39;s copiously illustrated retrospective for The Verge of every major iMac design</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘25th Anniversary of the iMac’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Pinned&#39; Links in Apple Messages </title><link href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-15/tips/how-to-pin-articles-and-images-sent-over-messages-in-ios-15-and-ipados-15" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v00" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/pinned-links-in-messages" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40176</id><published> 2023-08-16T19:15:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-17T00:35:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last week I noticed a feature for the first time: the contextual menu for a link or image sent in Messages has a “Pin” command. This is a different form of pinning than pinning an entire thread — it&#39;s just for individual <em>messages</em> , and only messages that are links <s>or images</s> . I couldn&#39;t figure out what this did until I found this write-up at AppleInsider, which explains the point. When you pin a link, you can refer back to it in the profile details for the contact(s) in that thread. That&#39;s the popover you get by:</p><ul><li> Tapping the user avatar in the center of the top navigation bar on iOS.</li><li> Clicking the “i”-in-circle Info button on MacOS.</li></ul><p> Scroll down in that popover and there&#39;s a section for pins, right above the section showing all photos in the conversation.</p><p> Kind of a weirdly obscure feature. I can see using it, maybe, now that I know it&#39;s there. But I never would have guessed it was there, and couldn&#39;t even figure out what “Pin” meant in this context until I searched the web for an answer.</p><p> <strong>Update 1:</strong> The AppleInsider article I&#39;m linking to claims the feature works for images in addition to links, and I originally just took them at their word for that, but it turns out it only works for links. We regret the error. But it just further confirms how unintuitive the feature is.</p><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> These pinned links also show up in Safari, in Safari&#39;s “Shared With You” list. In iOS Safari, you get to “Shared With You” by tapping in the URL location field — they appear under your Favorites. On the Mac, “Shared With You” is in Safari&#39;s sidebar, at the bottom, under your tab groups. Pinned links, as you&#39;d guess, stay at the top of the “Shared With You” list. But you can&#39;t unpin them in Safari on either iOS or MacOS, nor you can you pin other items in Shared With You from within Safari. And even within Messages, the only place where you can unpin a link is in its original location within the message thread. So if you pin a link in a busy thread, and want to unpin it after some time as passed, you need to scroll all the way back to when it originally appeared. You can&#39;t unpin links from the contact popover where they&#39;re listed. And if you “delete” a pinned link in the contact popover in Messages, <em>it deletes the original message</em> , not merely removes its pin. The more I figure out about this feature, the more half-baked it seems.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Pinned’ Links in Apple Messages’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/pinned-links-in-messages">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Dahlia Lithwick: &#39;Trump&#39;s Last Two Indictments Complement Each Other Perfectly&#39; </title><link href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/trump-indictments-jack-smith-fani-willis-themes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v01" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/lithwick-trump-two-indictments" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40177</id><published> 2023-08-16T19:12:11Z</published><updated> 2023-08-16T19:12:11Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Dahlia Lithwick, writing for Slate:</p><blockquote><p> The two most recent indictments filed against Donald J. Trump are mirror images in many ways. Jack Smith&#39;s federal document <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/trump-indictment-jack-smith-charges.html">filed in Washington</a> was spare almost to the point of being an inky line drawing, whereas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/15/us/politics/trump-georgia-indictment-annotated.html">Fani Willis&#39; Georgia filing</a> is rich and detailed and pointillist.

As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/opinion/trump-indictment-georgia-fani-willis.html?searchResultPosition=1">Norm Eisen and Amy Lee Copeland</a> point out, Smith&#39;s case will likely be blacked out for television and audio audiences, whereas Willis&#39; suit will most likely become must-see TV for weeks on end. Jennifer Rubin argues that the DC trial <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/15/fani-willis-trump-indictment-georgia/">will happen quickly</a> , while the Georgia case may face months of wrangling, flipping, bargaining with conspirators, and lengthy pretrial shenanigans. <a href="https://clairepotter.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share">Claire Potter points out</a> that Willis can seize Trump&#39;s assets under Georgia&#39;s RICO law.

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/special-counsel-twitter-messages-trump/index.html">Katelyn Polantz, reporting for CNN</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The special counsel&#39;s investigation into Donald Trump and the aftermath of the 2020 election sought the former president&#39;s Twitter direct messages, of which there were many, federal prosecutors and lawyers for Twitter revealed in newly unsealed transcripts from February court hearings about the search warrant. [...]</p><p> A lawyer representing Twitter, now called “X,” similarly confirmed in court that Trump&#39;s account had several private messages between users on the platform. “X” was able to find both the sent direct messages and deleted messages for prosecutors, according to the transcripts.</p><p> “We were able to determine that there was some volume in that for this account. There are confidential communications,” a lawyer for Twitter said about @realDonaldTrump&#39;s direct messages.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/us/politics/trump-twitter-direct-messages-warrant.html">Alan Feuer and Maggie Haberman, reporting for The New York Times</a> :</p><blockquote><p> While it remained unclear what sorts of information the messages contained and who exactly may have written them, it was a revelation that there were private messages associated with the Twitter account of Mr. Trump, who has famously been cautious about using written forms of communications in his dealings with aides and allies.</p><p> The papers included transcripts of hearings in Federal District Court in Washington in February during which Judge Beryl A. Howell asserted that Mr. Smith&#39;s office had sought Mr. Trump&#39;s direct messages — or DMs — from Twitter as part of a search warrant it executed on the account in January.</p><p> In one of the transcripts, a lawyer for Twitter, answering questions from Judge Howell, confirmed that the company had turned over to the special counsel&#39;s office “all direct messages, the DMs” from Mr. Trump&#39;s Twitter account, including those sent, received and “stored in draft form.”</p><p> The lawyer for Twitter told Judge Howell that the company had found both “deleted” and “nondeleted” direct messages associated with Mr. Trump&#39;s account.</p></blockquote><p> I am not at all surprised that “deleted” DMs are not in fact deleted, but rather hidden. I am slightly surprised that Trump — famously averse not just to using email and text messages, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/trump-texting.html">even to his own lawyers taking written notes in meetings</a> , so as not to leave a chain of evidence for his lifelong criminal activity — would use, of all things, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">infamously unencrypted</a> direct messaging feature on Twitter.

But the newly unsealed transcripts of the proceedings in her courtroom show that the fine was the least of the punishment. Howell lit into Twitter for taking “extraordinary” and apparently unprecedented steps to give Trump advance notice about the search warrant — despite prosecutors&#39; warnings, backed by unspecified evidence, that notifying Trump could cause grave damage to their investigation.</p><p> “Is this to make Donald Trump feel like he is a particularly welcomed new renewed user of Twitter?” Howell asked.</p><p> “Twitter has no interest other than litigation its constitutional rights,” replied attorney George Varghese of WilmerHale, the firm Twitter deploys for much of its litigation.</p><p> But Howell returned to the theme repeatedly during the proceedings, wondering why the company was taking “momentous” steps to protect Trump that it had never taken for other users. In the hearing on Feb. 7, 2023, Howell referenced Musk, asking: “Is it because the new CEO wants to cozy up with the former president?”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/23sc31%20Attachment%20A%20-%20Documents%20unsealed%20with%20redactions.pdf">The unsealed court filing (PDF) is here</a> , for your reading enjoyment.

<p>Jeremy B. Merrill and Drew Harwell, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The company formerly known as Twitter has begun slowing the speed with which users can access links to the New York Times, Facebook and other news organizations and online competitors, a move that appears targeted at companies that have drawn the ire of owner Elon Musk. [...] The delayed websites included X&#39;s online rivals Facebook, Instagram, Bluesky and Substack, as well as the Reuters wire service and the Times. All of them have previously been singled out by Musk for ridicule or attack.</p><p> The delay affects the t.co domain, a link-shortening service that X uses to process every link posted to the website. Traffic is routed through the middleman service, allowing X to track — and in this case throttle — activity to the target website, potentially taking away traffic and ad revenue from businesses Musk personally dislikes.</p><p> The Post&#39;s analysis found that links to most other sites were unaffected — including those to The Washington Post, Fox News and social media services such as Mastodon and YouTube — with the shortened links being routed to their final destination in a second or less. A user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060">first flagged</a> the delays early Tuesday on the technology discussion forum Hacker News.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060">The Hacker News thread</a> has the sort of nerdery you&#39;d expect, including the fact that you won&#39;t see the delay when using <code>curl</code> with its default user-agent string, because <code>curl</code> is special-cased by t.co.</p><p> Hanlon&#39;s Razor — “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity” — is a remarkably accurate rule of thumb. But in the case of Twitter/X, it&#39;s not helpful: the stupidity behind the company&#39;s poorly run services is matched by the spitefulness of its owner. Purposeful spite and inadvertent bug strike me as equally likely here, and the list of domain that suffer this delay really does look like Musk&#39;s shitlist. But regardless of the cause, the effect is undeniably bad for users: click or tap a link to these popular sites from Twitter, and it takes about 5 seconds for the URL to resolve.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hanlon’s Razor Meets Its Match: Twitter/X’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/hanlons-x">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump&#39;s Unsent Draft Tweets </title><link href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-drafted-tweet-calling-supporters-march-us-capitol-jan-6-2022-7" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzw" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/trump-unsent-draft-tweets" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40172</id><published> 2023-08-15T18:40:58Z</published><updated> 2023-08-16T02:50:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at Daring Fireball. In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is chock-a-block with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: drafting emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk: malware, data governance, and prompt injection attacks.</p><p> Kolide is taking a two-part approach to governing AI use: allowing you to draft AI policies <em>as a team</em> , and using Kolide to block malicious tools. <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">Visit Kolide&#39;s website</a> to learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/13/kolide">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Misbehavior in Robotaxis </title><link href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/08/11/san-francisco-robotaxi-cruise-debauchery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzs" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/11/misbehavior-in-robotaxis" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40168</id><published> 2023-08-11T22:31:47Z</published><updated> 2023-08-11T22:36:00Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Liz Lindqwister, writing for The San Francisco Standard:</p><blockquote><p> Ever thought about getting down and dirty in a robotaxi? Want to light up a cig or a joint on the drive home from the club?你不是一个人。</p><p> As autonomous vehicles become increasingly popular in San Francisco, some riders are wondering just how far they can push the vehicles&#39; limits — especially with no front-seat driver or chaperone to discourage them from questionable behavior.</p><p> For some, that&#39;s a welcome invitation to test the autonomous vehicles&#39; limits. Megan, a woman in her 20s, took her first robotaxi ride on a recent late-night excursion. It was also her first time having sex in a driverless vehicle. The Standard is not providing exact dates of the riders&#39; debauchery to protect their privacy but has verified the rides took place through documentation. Names have been changed because of the riders&#39; privacy concerns.</p></blockquote><p> Setting aside questions regarding their driving ability, autonomous taxis will prove to be an interesting behavioral playground. How clean will they remain? What&#39;s to keep people from smoking, littering, pissing, puking, and, yes, screwing inside? If 95 percent of passengers can behave as they would in a human-driven taxi or ride share, but the other 5 don&#39;t, they could turn putrid quickly. Like I wrote last night, you need to design for how people <em>do</em> behave, not how they <em>should</em> .</p><p> These robotaxis are all equipped with cameras, and the paying passenger is known through their account with the service, but the more you surveil their behavior while riding, the more you encroach on their privacy.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Misbehavior in Robotaxis’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/11/misbehavior-in-robotaxis">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;X Marks the Verb&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/magazine/on-language-x-marks-the-verb.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzr" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/11/x-marks-the-verb" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40167</id><published> 2023-08-11T21:48:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-11T22:20:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>A few weeks ago when Twitter was renamed to X, and we learned that Elon Musk somehow thinks people are going to use “x” as both a verb and noun, I recalled having once stumbled upon this 1983 “On Language” column from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/10/10/maven">the late great</a> William Safire:</p><blockquote><p> “The Federal bureaucracy has invented a new verb,” says Charles DeLaFuente of Kew Gardens, NY, who had just sent in his 1040 income-tax return to the Internal Revenue Service. He attached an addressed envelope that he had received from the IRS; in the upper left-hand corner, where the return address of the taxpayer belongs, is the heavy black outline of a box. Next to the box are the words “X box if refund.”</p><p> “Never mind the unanswered question, &#39;If refund what?&#39;,” the irate taxpayer observed. “We all know they mean to x the box if you have a refund coming. Maybe the ink they saved on those instructions will pay for the next round of tax cuts.”</p><p> Mr. DeLaFuente — his name means “of the fountain” — is blowing his geyser for the wrong reason. The verb to x is not new. In 1849, Edgar Allan Poe wrote in one of his tales: “&#39;I shell have to x this ere paragrab,&#39; said he to himself, as he read it over.” In 1935, Jonas Bayer carried that crossing-out metaphor into the mechanical age in Startling Detective magazine: “An imported hatchet man with a .45-caliber typewriter can x out the dangerous canary.” Merriam-Webster&#39;s first citation in the one-letter verb&#39;s literal sense is from Henry Cassidy&#39;s 1943 book “Moscow Dateline”: “I x&#39;d out the word &#39;west&#39; in the third question, changing it to &#39;east.&#39;”</p></blockquote><p> The whole column is a goldmine, including a section on the Philly accent (Eagles = “Iggles”) and another referencing perhaps the coolest-named American who ever lived, Pussyfoot Johnson.

<p>Thomas Germain, reporting for Gizmodo:</p><blockquote><p> Archived copies of CNET&#39;s author pages show the company deleted small batches of articles prior to the second half of July, but then the pace increased. Thousands of articles disappeared in recent weeks. A CNET representative confirmed that the company was culling stories but declined to share exactly how many it has taken down. The move adds to recent controversies over CNET&#39;s editorial strategy, which has included layoffs and experiments with error-riddled articles <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cnet-ai-chatgpt-tech-news-1850017739">written by AI chatbots</a> .</p><p> “Removing content from our site is not a decision we take lightly. Our teams analyze many data points to determine whether there are pages on CNET that are not currently serving a meaningful audience. This is an industry-wide best practice for large sites like ours that are primarily driven by SEO traffic,” said Taylor Canada, CNET&#39;s senior director of marketing and communications. “In an ideal world, we would leave all of our content on our site in perpetuity. Unfortunately, we are penalized by the modern internet for leaving all previously published content live on our site.” A representative for the CNET Media Workers Union declined to comment. (Disclosure: Gizmodo&#39;s Editor in Chief Dan Ackerman is a former CNET employee.)</p><p> CNET shared an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23903730-faq-on-cnet-content-pruning-aug-2023">internal memo</a> about the practice. Removing, redirecting, or refreshing irrelevant or unhelpful URLs “sends a signal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results,” the document reads.</p></blockquote><p> If you think it sounds really stupid that Google would penalize websites in search rankings for new content because they&#39;re hosting an archive of older content, you&#39;re right, that is stupid. And Google isn&#39;t stupid. <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800">From Google&#39;s Search Liaison Twitter account yesterday</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Are you deleting content from your site because you somehow believe Google doesn&#39;t like “old” content?

<p>Rachel Weiner, reporting for The Washington Post yesterday, “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/09/twitter-fine-jan-6-trump/">Twitter Was Fined $350,000 for Failing to Turn Over Trump&#39;s Data</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> The social media company Twitter was forced to hand over records from former president Donald Trump&#39;s account to the special counsel investigating the events leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and pay sanctions for failing to do so more quickly, as disclosed in an appellate court ruling unsealed Wednesday. [...]</p><p> Attorneys for Twitter did not oppose the search warrant but argued that a gag order preventing the company from alerting Trump to the search violated the First Amendment. The company argued that it should not have to hand over the records until that issue was resolved. Howell sided with the government, finding Twitter in contempt Feb. 7 for failing to comply with the search warrant. She gave Twitter until 5 pm to produce the records, with sanctions of $50,000 per day, to double every day that Twitter did not comply. Twitter produced the records three days later.</p></blockquote><p> The Post story focuses on Twitter&#39;s stonewalling — which, given that it took place this year, I presume was driven by Elon Musk. But I&#39;m keenly interested in what the search warrant was after. It wasn&#39;t Trump&#39;s tweets, which are public. So the obvious conclusion: his direct messages. Trump, famously, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/politics/donald-trump-computers-internet-email/index.html">does not use email</a> and, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/trump-texting.html">until this year</a> , apparently didn&#39;t use text messaging either. But did he send or receive DMs on Twitter? And was he stupid enough to put anything incriminating in them? Is he about to be hoisted with Twitter&#39;s unencrypted petard?</p><p> It seems unlikely on the surface that someone who doesn&#39;t use email or text messaging would use DMs, but if the special counsel was not looking for DMs, I&#39;m not even sure what the warrant <em>could</em> have been after. There just isn&#39;t much else associated with a Twitter account that isn&#39;t public. The least satisfying answer could be that the special counsel issued the warrant <em>just in case</em> Trump was a DM user, but he wasn&#39;t, and there was nothing (or nothing relevant) there. But the special counsel convinced the court that Trump&#39;s Twitter account information contained evidence of criminality. <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513.1208541751.0.pdf">From the unsealed appellate court ruling</a> :</p><blockquote><p> On January 17, 2023, the government applied for, and obtained, a search warrant that directed Twitter to produce data and records related to the “@realDonaldTrump” Twitter account. At the same time, the government applied for, and obtained, a nondisclosure order, which prohibited Twitter from disclosing the existence or contents of the search warrant to any person. Based on <em>ex parte</em> affidavits, the district court found probable cause to search the Twitter account for evidence of criminal offenses. Moreover, the district court found that there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that disclosing the warrant to former President Trump “would seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation” by giving him “an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of behavior, [or] notify confederates.” The warrant required Twitter to turn over all requested information by January 27, 2023. The nondisclosure order was to remain in effect for 180 days after its issuance.</p></blockquote><p> That doesn&#39;t sound like a fishing expedition.</p><p> Twitter DMs, infamously, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">are not encrypted</a> . With E2EE messaging platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp, messages are not magically protected from search warrants — but such messages can only be produced from the participants&#39; own devices or, depending on the platform, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/reuters_report_on_apple_dropping_plan_for_encrypted_icloud_backups">from backups of those devices</a> . But with non-encrypted Twitter DMs, the messages are just sitting there on Twitter&#39;s servers. We also know, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/twitter-bug-deleted-tweets">from this story just a few months ago</a> , that “deleted” tweets were just hidden, not actually deleted — and a bug resulted in deleted tweets resurfacing. Was that (or is it still) true for “deleted” direct messages as well? I think it&#39;s quite likely that every single DM ever sent on Twitter is still around.</p><p> Speaking of Twitter bugs, this bit from the unsealed court ruling made me laugh:</p><blockquote><p> The government faced difficulties when it first attempted to serve Twitter with the warrant and nondisclosure order. On January 17, 2023, the government tried to submit the papers through Twitter&#39;s website for legal requests, only to find out that the website was inoperative.

<p>Blake Brittain, reporting for Reuters:</p><blockquote><p> Dan Ackerman, editor in chief of the tech-news website Gizmodo, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Monday accusing Apple, the Tetris Company and others of adapting his book about the landmark video game Tetris into a feature film without his permission. <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/mopajkzbgva/APPLE%20TETRIS%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf">Ackerman said</a> he sent his book <em>The Tetris Effect</em> in 2016 to the Tetris Company, which allegedly copied it for the movie and threatened to sue him if he pursued his own film or television spinoffs.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/mopajkzbgva/APPLE%20TETRIS%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf">Reuters is hosting a copy of Ackerman&#39;s complaint</a> , which begins:</p><blockquote><p> The movie entitled “Tetris” demonstrated the confiscation of Dan Ackerman&#39;s original work and creation of his book “The Tetris Effect.”</p><p> Plaintiff Ackerman&#39;s book took a unique approach to writing about the real history of Tetris, as it not only applied the historical record, but also layered his own original research and ingenuity to create a compelling narrative non-fiction book in the style of a Cold War spy thriller.</p><p> Mr. Ackerman&#39;s literary masterpiece, unlike other articles and writings, dispelled of the emphasis on the actual gameplay and fans, and instead concentrated on the surrounding narrative, action sequences, and adversarial relationship between the players.</p><p> This was the identical approach Defendants adopted for the Tetris Film, without notable material distinction, but often resonating the exact same feel, tone, approach, and scenes as the book introduced several years prior.</p></blockquote><p> I have watched the movie ( <a href="https://boxd.it/44pyML">enjoyable, but flawed</a> ) and not read Ackerman&#39;s book, so I&#39;m in no position to judge whether the movie is a rip-off of the book.</p><p> I do find it a bit curious that there&#39;s no coverage of this lawsuit, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/search?blogId=4&amp;q=tetris&amp;timestamp=1691693511271">at least yet</a> , at Gizmodo itself, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tetris%20(from%3Adanackerman)&amp;f=live">nor from Ackerman</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Gizmodo Editor-in-Chief Dan Ackerman Sues Apple, Alleging ‘Tetris’ Movie Ripped Off His Book’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/10/ackerman-apple-tetris-lawsuit">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Banks Fined $549 Million for Conducting Business Via iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/8/23824521/wells-fargo-bnp-imessage-signal-whatsapp-messages-sec-fine" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzl" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/10/banks-fined-e2ee" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40161</id><published> 2023-08-10T18:45:15Z</published><updated> 2023-08-10T18:45:15Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Wes Davis, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Several US financial firms, including multiple Wells Fargo companies, will <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-149">pay a combined</a> $549 million in fines after admitting they couldn&#39;t produce discussions about company business from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">smartphone messaging apps</a> used by their employees, “including those at senior levels.”</p><p> Both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined banks for being unable to produce discussions going back to at least 2019. The regulators say employees used their personal devices to discuss official company business via apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, or Signal and that those “off-channel communications” weren&#39;t “maintained or preserved.”</p><p> Not keeping records of those conversations violates the 1934 Securities Exchange Act&#39;s recordkeeping rules, as well as similar rules from the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, according to the SEC.

<p>David Thiel and Renee DiResta, announcing their own report for Stanford&#39;s Internet Observatory investigating child sexual abuse material on Mastodon servers:</p><blockquote><p> Analysis over a two-day period found 112 matches for known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in addition to nearly 2,000 posts that used the 20 most common hashtags which indicate the exchange of abuse materials. The researchers reported CSAM matches to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p><p> The report finds that child safety challenges pose an issue across decentralized social media networks and require a collective response. Current tools for addressing child sexual exploitation and abuse online — such as PhotoDNA and mechanisms for detecting abusive accounts or recidivism — were developed for centrally managed services and must be adapted for the unique architecture of the Fediverse and similar decentralized social media projects.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/vb515nd6874">Their report</a> is interesting and nuanced, and points to aspects of the problem you might not have considered. For example, tooling:</p><blockquote><p> Administrative moderation tooling is also fairly limited: for example, while Mastodon allows user reports and has moderator tools to review them, it has no built-in mechanism to report CSAM to the relevant child safety organizations. It also has no tooling to help moderators in the event of being exposed to traumatic content — for example, grayscaling and fine-grained blurring mechanisms.</p></blockquote><p> I cannot agree with the headlines regarding this report:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/24/twitter-rival-mastodon-rife-with-child-abuse-material-study-finds/">The Washington Post</a> : “Twitter Rival Mastodon Rife With Child-Abuse Material, Study Finds”</li><li> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23806093/mastodon-csam-study-decentralized-network">The Verge</a> : “Stanford Researchers Find Mastodon Has a Massive Child Abuse Material Problem”</li><li> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mastodons-decentralized-social-network-has-a-major-csam-problem-202519000.html">Engadget</a> : “Mastodon&#39;s Decentralized Social Network Has a Major CSAM Problem”</li></ul><p> Every instance of CSAM is a heinous crime. But it&#39;s impractical to think that any large-scale social network could be utterly free of CSAM, or CSAM-adjacent material. Words like <em>rife</em> , <em>massive</em> , and <em>major</em> to me do not fairly describe the report&#39;s findings. My conclusion is that while Mastodon server admins can do a better job — and seem sorely in need of better content moderation tooling for handling CSAM — the overall frequency of such material on the top 25 instances is <em>lower</em> than I expected, especially from the headlines.</p><p> (I also suspect, simply through gut feeling, that much if not most CSAM in the fediverse occurs on smaller fly-by-night instances, not the big public ones which the Stanford study examined.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Stanford Study on CSAM on Mastodon’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/stanford-csam-mastodon">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Remembering Mimi Sheraton, Innovative New York Times Food Critic </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/dining/mimi-sheraton-dead.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzi" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/remembering-mimi-sheraton" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40158</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:51:26Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T18:51:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>In the course of researching <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad">that previous item</a> , wherein then-NYT restaurant critic Mimi Sheraton accompanied Colonel Sanders to a Manhattan KFC in 1976, I learned that she died just a few months ago, at age 97. Truly a groundbreaking career:</p><blockquote><p> An adventurer with a passion for offbeat experiences, an eclectic taste for foods and the independence to defy pressures from restaurateurs and advertisers, Ms. Sheraton was the first woman to review restaurants for The Times. She pioneered reviewing-in-disguise, dining in wigs and tinted glasses and using aliases for reservations, mostly in high-end places where people would have otherwise known her from repeat visits and lavished their attentions on her.</p><p> “The longer I reviewed restaurants, the more I became convinced that the unknown customer has a completely different experience from either a valued patron or a recognized food critic,” she wrote in her 2004 memoir, “Eating My Words: An Appetite for Life.” “For all practical purposes, they might as well be in different restaurants.”</p></blockquote><p> Knowing what I know about the restaurant industry, it&#39;s hard to believe reviews were ever conducted <em>not</em> in disguise. That regular patrons (and recognized critics) get better service and food couldn&#39;t be more obvious, which is the reason <a href="https://kottke.org/13/09/on-the-regular">it&#39;s such a joy to find your favorite spots and become a valued regular at them</a> .</p><blockquote><p> Colleagues and other restaurant critics described her reviews as tough but fair and scrupulously researched. The Times required three visits to a restaurant before publishing a review; she dined six to eight times before passing judgment. For an article on deli sandwiches, she collected 104 corned beef and pastrami samples in one day to evaluate the meat and sandwich-building techniques. [...]</p><p> Another of her reviews, based on blind tastings by several Times staff members, favored private-label liquors over popular brand names of Scotch, bourbon, rye, vodka and gin. The review ran weeks before Christmas, the busy liquor-selling season.</p><p> “I heard that two million dollars&#39; worth of advertising had been canceled,” Ms. Sheraton recalled in her memoir. She approached the executive editor. “I asked Abe Rosenthal if that was true. He said, &#39;That&#39;s none of your business. It was a great story.&#39;”</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Remembering Mimi Sheraton, Innovative New York Times Food Critic’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/remembering-mimi-sheraton">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;For the Colonel, It Was Finger‐Lickin&#39; Bad&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzh" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40157</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:40:55Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T20:17:00Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>MrBeast being displeased with the quality of MrBeast Burgers brings to my mind Colonel Harland Sanders, who founded Kentucky Fried Chicken, sold the company to a conglomerate in 1964, and then remained their paid spokesman for the remainder of his life, despite the fact that he despised their food and professed deep regret that he sold the chain. In 1976, New York Times restaurant critic Mimi Sheraton accompanied the then-86-year-old Sanders to a KFC in midtown Manhattan:</p><blockquote><p> Once in the kitchen, the colonel walked over to a vat full of frying chicken pieces and announced, “That&#39;s much too black. It should be golden brown. You&#39;re frying for 12 minutes — that&#39;s six minutes too long. What&#39;s more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That&#39;s the worst fried chicken I&#39;ve ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?”</p><p> When Mr. Singleton explained that he first mixed boiling water into the instant powdered potatoes, the colonel interrupted. “And then you have wallpaper paste,” he said. “Next suppose you add some of this brown gravy stuff and then you have sludge.” “There&#39;s no way anyone can get me to swallow those potatoes,” he said after tasting some. “And this cole slaw. This cole slaw! They just won&#39;t listen to me. It should he chopped, not shredded, and it should be made with Miracle Whip. Anything else turns gray. And there should be nothing in it but cabbage. No carrots!”</p><p> Mr. Singleton replied, “I just do what I&#39;m told, sir,” and Colonel Sanders then said gently to the now stunned manager, “Well, it&#39;s not your fault. You&#39;re just working for a company that doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s doing.”</p></blockquote><p> Sanders was being paid $200,000 a year at the time to represent the chain in commercials. But what were they going to do — fire him? I wonder how many kids today realize Sanders was a real man who actually founded the chain, and not a fictional mascot, like Ronald McDonald, or the great pizza connoisseur Charles Entertainment Cheese?</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘For the Colonel, It Was Finger‐Lickin’ Bad’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/sanders-finger-lickin-bad">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> MrBeast Sued for $100 Million by Company Behind His Virtual Burger Restaurant Chain </title><link href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/mr-beast-sued-burger-company-100-million-1235689127/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzg" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/mrbeast-burger-suit" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40156</id><published> 2023-08-09T18:05:58Z</published><updated> 2023-08-09T18:26:37Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Elizabeth Wagmeister, reporting for Variety:</p><blockquote><p> The biggest YouTube star in the world — Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast — is being sued by Virtual Dining Concepts, the ghost kitchen company that operates his virtual restaurant chain, MrBeast Burger. [...]</p><p> In Donaldson&#39;s original lawsuit against VDC, he blamed the company for poor food quality and said that the majority of MrBeast Burger virtual restaurants have negative culinary reviews from fans who are “deeply disappointed by the fact that MrBeast would put his name on this product.” The lawsuit said that VDC “has caused material, irreparable harm to the MrBeast brand and MrBeast&#39;s reputation,” and claimed that while the business has made millions of dollars, he has “not received a dime.” In response, last week, VDC asserted that the YouTube star&#39;s brand grew “exponentially” in part “because of the MrBeast Burger brand itself.”</p></blockquote><p> The argument that Donaldson&#39;s brand grew because of the burger brand seems specious. But perhaps I&#39;m out of touch with the latest trends in fast food — I&#39;d never heard of MrBeast Burger until recently, but it turns out they have “ <a href="https://www.mrbeastburger.com/about">ghost kitchens</a> ” all over the place, including here in Philadelphia.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘MrBeast Sued for $100 Million by Company Behind His Virtual Burger Restaurant Chain’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/mrbeast-burger-suit">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Yankee Stadium Drone Fly-Through</title><link href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cvs1k8NAfWH/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzf" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/09/yankee-stadium" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40155</id><published> 2023-08-09T17:26:48Z</published><updated> 2023-08-16T03:36:45Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Casey Liss:</p><blockquote><p> When I watch a movie or TV show, I&#39;m <em>constantly</em> trying to figure out who that actor is, who the director is, and so on.

<p>My thanks to Warp for sponsoring last week at DF. Warp is a blazingly fast, Rust-based terminal reimagined from the ground up to work like a modern app. A lot of “modern” terminal apps just offer ways to make your windows look cool — colors, transparency, stuff like that. Warp offers all of that in spades — it&#39;s a very cool-looking terminal. But Warp is highly innovative in <em>functional</em> ways too. Even if you don&#39;t care at all how your terminal looks, Warp is definitely worth checking out.</p><p> Warp lets you edit your commands like in an IDE, with selections, auto-suggestions, and completion menus. Generate commands from natural language using AI so you don&#39;t have to context switch to Google (or whatever your preferred search engine is) anymore.

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/13/meta-threads-engagement-has-dropped-off-sensor-tower-similarweb.html">Hayden Field, reporting for CNBC last month</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Last week, the text-based social media platform reported a record 100 million sign-ups in just five days, but according to data from Sensor Tower and Similarweb, the service has seen some dropoff in growth and engagement.</p><p> “The Threads launch really did &#39;break the internet,&#39; or at least the Sensor Tower models,” Anthony Bartolacci, managing director at Sensor Tower, a marketing intelligence firm, told CNBC. “In the 10-plus years Sensor Tower has been estimating app installs, the first 72 hours of Threads was truly in a class by itself.”</p><p> But, he added, Sensor Tower data suggests a significant pullback in user engagement since Threads&#39; launch: On Tuesday and Wednesday, the platform&#39;s number of daily active users were down about 20% from Saturday, and the time spent for user was down 50%, from 20 minutes to 10 minutes.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/nobody_uses_threads_anymore" title="Nobody Uses Threads Anymore, It's Too Crowded">I wrote earlier this week</a> about the onslaught of “ <em>turns out Threads is a bust</em> ” news stories following in the wake of “ <em>Threads launches as a sensational hit</em> ” stories. One thing that&#39;s struck me while following this is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=threads+sensor+tower&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news">just how many of these stories cite Sensor Tower data</a> . But how much should we take Sensor Tower&#39;s usage data at face value? Sensor Tower can only estimate these numbers, it can&#39;t <em>know</em> them. They aren&#39;t Apple or Google (the owners of the app stores through which Threads remains exclusively distributed, and mobile OSes that report back analytics data from all users who opt-in), nor do they have any access to Meta&#39;s own copious data.</p><p> Here&#39;s what Sensor Tower claims about their data collection, under “ <a href="https://sensortower.com/responsibly-sourced-data" title="Sensor Tower: Responsibly Sourced Data">Where our data comes from</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> Our data scientists and algorithms process and enrich trillions of aggregated data points contributed to us from millions of devices, to cultivate our one-of-a-kind data estate. They get this data from a statistical panel of consumers we have built to continuously learn from millions of people around the world. Our panelists provide us data as they use our popular privacy-compliant mobile apps. We employ best practices to ensure that our panelists understand what data they are providing us in exchange for the use of our apps.</p><p> The team in our app studio publishes apps in several categories:</p><ul><li><p> Wellbeing [ <em>sic</em> ] apps aid in improving our users&#39; quality of life, such as ActionDash and StayFree</p></li><li><p> Games provide entertainment and escape for users, such as Melodies Run [ <em>sic</em> , sort of <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-05">1</a></sup> ]</p></li><li><p> Advanced apps and browser plugins provide convenience, such as Friendly Streaming, Friendly Retail, Stayfocusd and Adblock Luna</p></li></ul></blockquote><p> So Sensor Tower&#39;s information comes from analytics it collects from its own apps. They name these apps, but don&#39;t link to them, so I will:</p><ul><li><p> ActionDash — <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actiondash.playstore">Exclusive to Android</a> , ActionDash is described as a “screen time helper” that is “trusted globally by over 1 million users to break their phone addiction”. The developer is listed as “ActionDash”, not Sensor Tower, but the <a href="https://actiondash.com">app&#39;s website</a> says “Copyright © 2020 Sensor Tower, Inc” in the footer. As a screen-time monitor, you can see how this app would, by definition, provide Sensor Tower with information about everything a user does on their phone.</p></li><li><p> StayFree — Another “screen time tracker”, available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burockgames.timeclocker">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stayfree-web-stay-focused/id1631132311">iOS</a> . The Android description:</p><blockquote><p> StayFree - Screen Time &amp; Limit App Usage is a self control, productivity and phone addiction controller app that allows you to show how much time you spend on your smartphone and helps you focus by restricting the usage of apps. You can set usage limits for your apps and receive alerts when exceeding those usage limits.</p></blockquote><p> The iOS description:</p><blockquote><p> StayFree - Web Analytics &amp; Screen Time Tracker is an analytics, self control, productivity, and web addiction controller extension. This app works with the Safari web browser on your iOS device. StayFree provides analytics to help you understand how you are using the internet (daily website usage statistics) and focus your time by restricting the usage of distracting websites.</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s a very different description. But the latest iOS release, version 2.2, claims:</p><blockquote><p> We are introducing usage monitoring for applications in addition to websites! This marks the first stage of the feature, which is currently in beta. Although it may initially be somewhat sluggish and prone to errors, we anticipate ongoing improvements in future updates.</p></blockquote><p> StayFree observes your Safari usage through an extension that prompts for permission to observe every single website you visit. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/08/stayfree-safari-permission-confirmation.jpeg">Here&#39;s the alert I OK&#39;d to permit this</a> . It monitors your app usage by asking for access to your Screen Time. I installed StayFree last week and, in the name of science, granted it access to both my web browsing and Screen Time. (I plan to delete it as soon as I publish this story.) I have found it to be exactly as described: very slow and prone to errors. What it does report can be viewed faster and with a better presentation in the Screen Time section of Settings. The StayFree Safari extension keeps many web pages from even loading for me.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://melodiesrun.apppage.net/">Melody Run</a> — An infinite runner game, where you slide the hero left/right to hit squares, and each square you hit plays the note from a song. You score gems that can be cashed in to unlock new songs, and you can collect hundreds of gems at a time by watching video ads, which seem to all be for other games. It strikes me as neither fun nor challenging but it is a real game, and there&#39;s apparently a level editor you can unlock if you play more than I was willing to. The game seems identical on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/melodies-run/id1599540626">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativetechnology.melodies3d&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us">Android</a> , but only the iOS app asks whether you agree to let the game track you while using other apps. Even with tracking permitted, though, I fail to see how this game is able to collect the sort of detailed usage data Sensor Tower reports, except for your usage of other apps that embed the same tracking frameworks. There&#39;s no way, for example, that playing Melody Run would allow Sensor Tower to gain any information about Threads. Not how long you use it, not how often you launch it, not even whether you have it installed. That&#39;s the whole point of <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/security-of-runtime-process-sec15bfe098e/web">sandboxing</a> .</p></li><li><p> Friendly — Sensor Tower mentions apps named Friendly Streaming and Friendly Retail. I can&#39;t find any apps with those exact names, but I believe they&#39;re referring to a small suite of apps from <a href="https://friendly.io">a company called Friendly</a> , which publishes apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id400169658?pt=2051617&amp;ct=friendly.io&amp;mt=8">iOS</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/friendly-streaming/id553245401?mt=12">MacOS</a> , and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7399185471421849469">Android</a> . <a href="https://friendly.io/insights/privacy/">Friendly&#39;s privacy policy</a> declares that they&#39;re “an affiliate of Sensor Tower Inc.” Friendly Social Browser is a web browser with built-in bookmarks for sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Friendly Streaming Browser is a Mac app that&#39;s just a web browser with built-in bookmarks for YouTube and major streaming sites. (Somehow Friendly Streaming Browser was deemed by Apple worthy of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1655204439">this App Store feature story</a> .) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-shopping-browser/id6443906359">Friendly Shopping Browser</a> is, you guessed it, a web browser with built-in bookmarks for shopping sites like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-shopping-insights/id6444090373">Friendly Shopping Insights</a> is an app dedicated to Amazon — you log in with your Amazon credentials and it shows you your spending history and habits. Basically it&#39;s an app that, I think, lets Sensor Tower see everything you buy or look at in Amazon, along with your purchase history. I say “I think” because I didn&#39;t actually log into my Amazon account after installing it. Why anyone would ever use any of these apps I have no idea.</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.stayfocusd.com/">StayFocused</a> — “a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend on time-wasting websites.”</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://adblockluna.com/">Adblock Luna</a> — Adblock Luna is a VPN promoted specifically for ad blocking. When a VPN is installed and active, all network traffic is tunneled through the VPN. Your VPN provider can see (and thus track) <em>everything</em> you do on the internet, whether it&#39;s through a browser (including private/incognito tabs) or an app. Sensor Tower claims “more than 15 million users have already installed Luna”. These users are an incredibly rich source of information for Sensor Tower.</p><p> Adblock Luna <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensortower.luna">is in Google&#39;s Play Store</a> , but when you tap the “Install for Android” button on the Luna website, instead of linking to the Play Store, they instead <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/08/adblock-luna-android-install.png">show this popover</a> instructing you to (1) enable the Android setting to allow apps to be installed from unknown sources (aka sideloading); then (2) install the .apk app bundle that was just downloaded to your device. I don&#39;t know why they steer users to sideloading rather than the version of Adblock Luna in the Play Store, but to me that&#39;s a red flag.</p><p> Adblock Luna is not in Apple&#39;s App Store. For iOS devices, they direct you to <a href="https://adblockluna.com/install">this page</a> . First, they require you type the year you were born to “prove” you&#39;re over 18. Then you download a VPN profile and they walk you through the steps in Settings to enable their root trust certificate. It&#39;s obvious why this isn&#39;t in the App Store. This is about as close as you can get to installing third-party system software on iOS.</p></li></ul><hr /><p> So, I see three ways Sensor Tower collects usage information for apps and websites that aren&#39;t their own: (1) ad-blocking web browser extensions, (2) screen-time monitoring apps for Android and iOS, which on iOS requires access to Screen Time, and (3) the Adblock Luna VPN. (Perhaps I&#39;m underestimating how much data they can collect from users who play Melody Run.)</p><p> These apps may well be popular — again, they claim that Adblock Luna has been installed by over 15 million users — but is the data they collect from them representative of the general public? ActionDash and StayFree are advertised for people who are looking to “break their phone addiction”. Data collected from these apps might be accurate for those users, but are users who self-identify as having an “addiction” to their devices representative of typical users? This seems a bit like trying to glean beverage consumption statistics by polling self-professed alcoholics — neither those actively struggling with an addiction nor those who are successfully managing one strike me as likely to be representative of the general public.</p><p> The user base for these apps must be comprised largely of technically naive, uninformed users. (Also: cheapskates, given that Sensor Tower&#39;s tools are free of charge. Quite literally, their users are their product.) Both iOS and Android have built-in screen-time monitoring features, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982">Screen Time</a> on iOS, <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en">Digital Wellbeing</a> on Android. Both allow you to track usage and set limits. If there&#39;s a single advantage to installing ActionDash or StayFree instead of using the built-in system features, I don&#39;t know what it is. Ad blocking, of course, is very popular, but using a VPN for ad blocking, instead of a web browser extension, is like using a chainsaw to remove the kernels from a cob of corn — not just overkill but dangerous. There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s not in the iOS App Store, and why Sensor Tower steers Android users to a self-hosted version that&#39;s not in the Play Store.</p><p> The vast majority of the public would never even think to install a third-party screen-time monitor. And by most estimates, only <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+percentage+of+people+use+ad+blockers">40 percent of people use ad blockers</a> . Anyone looking for screen-time monitoring and controls should use the built-in features on their device. I find it hard to believe that anyone who truly understands the nature of a VPN, when looking for an ad-blocking tool, would choose to use a free VPN from a data analytics company. But those are the people whose internet usage Sensor Tower tracks, and thus the people whom the mainstream news media blindly cites, by way of Sensor Tower&#39;s pronouncements, <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-05">2</a></sup> as representative of the world at large.</p><p> The installation instructions for Adblock Luna are surely scary to non-technical laypeople, and they&#39;re downright terrifying to anyone expert enough to understand how VPNs works. So who is left? The ignorant but brazen. Perhaps such people&#39;s web and app usage really is representative of the public at large. But there&#39;s no way to know. We can judge the accuracy of, say, political pollsters by comparing their data to the actual results of elections. There&#39;s no such reckoning for the usage data published by Sensor Tower and their ilk. It&#39;s all unverifiable, but never reported as such. The news media so badly wants to know usage data that they just accept Sensor Tower and other such firms&#39; pronouncements at face value, without ever describing — let alone questioning — how they ostensibly know what they claim to know about very private data. <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-05"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-05">3</a></sup></p><p> Color me dubious.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-05"><p> There&#39;s a 2-star review in the Play Store that starts, “I rated 2 cause of this: you changed your name to melody run when its supposed to be melodies run. I can&#39;t get to the level editor!” So I guess that explains why Sensor Tower&#39;s website claims the game&#39;s name is “Melodies Run” — that actually <a href="https://melodiesrun.apppage.net/">used to be the name</a> . And at least one user is upset about the name changing to Melody Run. <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-05"><p> There are other companies in the same racket as Sensor Tower. The next-most-frequently cited, at least in my reading, is Similarweb. <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/corp/ourdata/">Similarweb&#39;s own description of how they source their data</a> is far more opaque than Sensor Tower&#39;s, and thus strikes me as even more dubious. <a href="#fnr2-2023-08-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-08-05"><p> Here&#39;s a thought exercise. Imagine if Apple and Google issued weekly reports revealing how many people used, say, the most popular 1,000 apps in their respective App Stores, along with how much time, on average, they spent using them. That would be data that could fairly be assumed to be accurate. But would not the major news media — publications such as The New York Times, that generally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=big+tech">report on “Big Tech” in an unflattering light</a> — object to such reporting as a violation of users&#39; collective privacy? As further proof that these companies know too much about us? But yet they echo the same information, when reported by Sensor Tower and Similarweb, without batting an eye or ever raising a question as to how this very private data is collected. <a href="#fnr3-2023-08-05"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ What&#39;s the Deal With Sensor Tower?</title></entry><entry><title> Android Spyware Maker LetMeSpy Shuts Down After Hacker Deletes Server Data </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/05/letmespy-spyware-shuts-down-wiped-server/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz9" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/05/letmespy" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40149</id><published> 2023-08-05T19:52:12Z</published><updated> 2023-08-05T19:52:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Zack Whittaker, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> Poland-based spyware LetMeSpy is no longer operational and said it will shut down after a June data breach wiped out its servers, including its huge trove of data stolen from thousands of victims&#39; phones.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1686828350289887232">Elon Musk, on Twitter/X</a> :</p><blockquote><p> If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting. People from every corner of the world post incredible content on X, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred dollars a month changes their life.</p><p> While we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%. First 12 months is still free for all.</p><p> Apple does take 30%, but I will speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook">@tim_cook</a> and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30% of what X keeps in order to maximize what creators receive.</p></blockquote><p> A couple of thoughts on this. First, it strikes me as exceedingly unlikely that Apple is going to carve out any sort of exception for X Corp. And even if Apple <em>were</em> to carve out an exception for Twitter creator subscriptions, it certainly wouldn&#39;t be to only take 30 percent of what X Corp keeps from these subscriptions, especially given these — admittedly creator-friendly — terms.</p><p> Second, even if Apple were in the habit of carving out case-by-case exceptions to their in-app-purchase revenue split terms — and they&#39;re not — why in the world would they grant such an exception to X Corp, when Musk&#39;s oft-stated goal is to grow the platform into an “everything app” that encompasses chat, shopping, banking, entertainment, publishing, ride-hailing, and more. Gaming, of course, would be an area near and dear to Apple&#39;s financial interests. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">As I wrote about this “everything app” pipe dream last October</a> , the exemplars in Asia — WeChat in China, Line in Japan, etc. — are best thought of not as <em>apps</em> but as <em>platforms</em> , and we already have platforms that encompass everything: iOS and Android. This is why Apple (and Google) feel fully justified in taking their cuts of digital-goods transactions on their platforms — they&#39;re the ones who built the platforms that enable this commerce. If Musk were to succeed in building X into an “everything app”, it would implicitly mean usurping the role iOS and Android play today as the everything platforms. Why would Apple help X Corp get started down that path by agreeing to let them conduct reduced-fee — let alone no-fee — transactions?</p><p> Third, it&#39;s striking to me that Musk only mentions Apple and Tim Cook. Not a word about Android. One factor is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738370/google-play-cut-music-streaming-apps-10-percent-regulation">Google dropped the Play Store&#39;s revenue split for content subscriptions to 85/15</a> two years ago. I think Apple should drop their entire App Store fee structure to a flat 85/15, for purchases and subscriptions alike, for everything <em>other</em> than gaming (which is both where the money is and where a 70/30 split remains commensurate with the rest of the industry). But still, Google is charging 15 percent on every Twitter/X creator subscription made using the Android app. I suspect they&#39;re escaping Musk&#39;s attention simply because people on Android spend so much less money than people on iOS.</p><p> Last, Musk doesn&#39;t mention that these creator subscriptions can be made on X Corp&#39;s website (twitter.com). Why not just pull the in-app subscriptions from X&#39;s iPhone app and steer all purchases to the web?

<p>Jason Snell, Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> Apple announced its results for its fiscal third quarter on Thursday. As expected, it was a down quarter — though at a 1% drop over the year-ago quarter, it&#39;s a better result than the previous quarter, which was down 3% year-over-year. The company reported $81.8B in revenue and $19.9B in profit.</p><p> The three key hardware categories were all down year-over-year: Mac was down 7%, iPad was down 20%, and the all-important iPhone was down 2%. Things were a little different in the two portions of Apple&#39;s business that have shown indefatigable growth in recent years: Services revenue was up 8% and the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category was up 2%.</p><p> In <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">a press release accompanying the results</a> , Apple CFO Luca Maestri trumpeted that it has broken the billion paid subscriptions barrier.</p></blockquote><p> No big surprises. Still lots of switchers coming to iPhone and Mac, and a lot of first-time iPad buyers. That, to me, is a healthy pulse check.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Q3 2023 Results’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-results">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Card&#39;s Savings Account Reached $10 Billion in Deposits </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-cards-savings-account-by-goldman-sachs-sees-over-10-billion-usd-in-deposits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz5" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-card-savings" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40145</id><published> 2023-08-03T22:26:07Z</published><updated> 2023-08-04T00:08:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Apple Newsroom:</p><blockquote><p> Today, Apple announced that Apple Card&#39;s high-yield Savings account offered by Goldman Sachs has reached over $10 billion in deposits from users since launching in April. Savings enables Apple Card users to grow their Daily Cash rewards with a Savings account from Goldman Sachs, which offers a high-yield APY of 4.15 percent.</p></blockquote><p> Last week, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-the-partnership-between-apple-and-goldman-soured?rc=jfy0lk">in The Information</a> :</p><blockquote><p> As of earlier this year, the Apple Card had roughly 10 million users, according to a person with direct knowledge of the figure, which hasn&#39;t been previously reported.</p></blockquote><p> That works out to a nice even $1,000 average per Apple Card user. I&#39;m guessing though, that the <em>median</em> is much lower, and the mean average is $1,000 because a smaller number of users have transferred large amounts to take advantage of the 4.15 percent interest rate. (I currently get 3.93 percent from TD Bank, so I just use my Apple Card savings account for my cash back rewards.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Card’s Savings Account Reached $10 Billion in Deposits’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-card-savings">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Watch Ultra 2 to Be Available in Dark Titanium, Says Leaker </title><link href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1686388137633918976" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz4" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/dark-apple-watch-ultra" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40144</id><published> 2023-08-03T15:18:36Z</published><updated> 2023-08-03T15:30:51Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Leaker ShrimpApplePro, on Twitter/X: <sup>*</sup></p><blockquote><p> Apple Watch Ultra 2. Same design. And I can confirm this year we will have the black titanium this year along with the current standard titanium.</p></blockquote><p> Yours truly, reviewing the Apple Watch Ultra last year:</p><blockquote><p> I don&#39;t own the silver link bracelet to try it, but I suspect it <em>doesn&#39;t</em> play paired with the Ultra. Brushed stainless steel and titanium are too different to be considered a match, but too similar to have deliberate contrast. I wish Apple were committed enough to the Link Bracelet to make a new one in titanium to match the case of the Ultra. (I also hope that future generations of Apple Watch Ultra are available with a space gray or black coating.)</p></blockquote><p> The last Apple Watch I bought for myself was a Series 7 in space black titanium. Given that the original Ultra was a hit, it seems like a no-brainer to offer it in a dark option this year. I think the biggest logistical complication for Apple with this is that it will multiply <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands/apple-watch-ultra-49mm">the number of Ultra straps they need to offer</a> — the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop bands have titanium fixtures that ought to match the watch case, and ideally, they&#39;d color match the buckle hardware on the elastomer Ocean Bands too. But there&#39;s a reason they put the COO in charge of Apple Watch.</p><p> One question I have: is the Action button going to remain orange, or is that color going to change each year? I&#39;m hoping it stays orange. (The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">orange hints on Vision Pro&#39;s head strap</a> suggest the color is more than a seasonal fad.)</p><p> ( <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/">Via MacRumors</a> .)</p><p> <small>* I&#39;ll drop the “Twitter” when twitter.com starts redirecting to x.com, and not the other way around. Even with the slapdash way they&#39;ve enacted this name change, you&#39;d think that would&#39;ve happened by now. Must be a complicated mess behind the scenes.</small></p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Watch Ultra 2 to Be Available in Dark Titanium, Says Leaker’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/dark-apple-watch-ultra">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Arc 1.0 </title><link href="https://arc.net/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz3" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/arc" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40143</id><published> 2023-08-02T22:11:38Z</published><updated> 2023-08-03T01:03:28Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Upstart web browser Arc, which remains exclusive to the Mac <a href="https://arc.net/">for now</a> , is out of beta. I find Arc hard to explain in a nutshell, and personally, it&#39;s not for me. But I&#39;ve got some friends who really dig it, and I can see why. It&#39;s a rethinking of how a web browser should look and work. It&#39;s less like a traditional browser and more like a virtual environment/platform unto itself, where tabs are more like apps inside a parent Arc window.</p><p> The reason it doesn&#39;t resonate with me is that I&#39;m both deeply accustomed to <em>and really like</em> Safari. But if you find yourself dissatisfied with Safari and other traditional browsers like Chrome, you should definitely give Arc a look. It&#39;s clever and ambitious. Ultimately they&#39;re a company that&#39;s just trying to make a really great, novel web browser for power users. I even love the name of the company: <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">The Browser Company of New York</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Arc 1.0’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/arc">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Flighty 3.0 </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/flight-tracker-flighty-adds-a-private-social-network-for-tracking-loved-ones-travels/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uz2" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/flighty-3" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40142</id><published> 2023-08-02T21:17:22Z</published><updated> 2023-08-04T16:55:48Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch last week:</p><blockquote><p> With today&#39;s launch of Flighty 3.0, users will have a new way of sharing their flight information with trusted others, without having to rely on forwarding airline confirmation emails or sending texts.</p><p> Instead, Flighty is introducing the concept of “Flighty Friends,” a way to track loved ones&#39; flight details automatically. The concept builds on the friends&#39; flights feature already available in previous versions of Flighty, which allowed users to share their live flight information with others through the app.</p><p> Now, users can connect directly with one another in Flighty — similar to how you would “friend” someone on a social network. Afterward, the connected users would receive updates about their family members&#39; or friends&#39; flights on an ongoing basis. The app&#39;s notifications would then read something like “mom has landed,” instead of just noting a flight number has landed, and would include the user&#39;s profile photo.</p></blockquote><p> Terrific update to one of my very favorite iOS apps. We don&#39;t fly a ton, but my family flies often enough that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1358823008">Flighty</a> &#39;s $89/year family plan feels like a bargain. It&#39;s just $49/year for a single-user account. Everything about Flighty is just so nice, and so convenient. Its Live Activities widget is so well done that Apple featured Flighty in the WWDC keynote, and gave it an Apple Design Award this year.</p><p> Last year I had a flight get cancelled about an hour before it was supposed to start boarding. I got an alert from Flighty, immediately dashed over to the nearest gate agent, and got rebooked on another flight <em>before</em> American Airlines notified me that the original flight had been cancelled.</p><p> Back in January <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/meanwhile_over_in_androidtown" title="Daring Fireball: Meanwhile, Over in Androidtown">I wrote about the vast discrepancy between best-of-breed apps on iOS compared to Android</a> , using Mastodon clients as an example. Flighty is another such exemplar. It&#39;s exclusive to iOS and MacOS, and there&#39;s simply nothing close to it on Android. Flighty&#39;s free mode is quite useful too, and you get access to Flighty Pro free of charge for your first flight.</p><p> <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/news/travel/flighty-app-friends-flights/">Gunnar Olson writing for Thrifty Traveler</a> , and<br /> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-fly-without-these-five-travel-apps-b17b0755">Dawn Gilbertson writing for the WSJ</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Flighty 3.0’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/02/flighty-3">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
