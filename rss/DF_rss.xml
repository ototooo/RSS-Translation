<p>BIS 唱片公司创始人罗伯特·冯·巴尔 (Robert von Bahr)：</p><blockquote><p>几天前，BIS Records 迎来了 50 岁生日，我对我们这个小团队在这半个世纪中所取得的成就感到非常自豪。 BIS 的专长是在为核心曲目付出努力的同时，培养年轻的古典艺术家和有趣的在世作曲家，并保护我们所有人代表的未来的音乐宝藏。正是出于这个目的，经过深思熟虑，在刚刚年满 80 岁的我，我很高兴地宣布一个相当重大的消息：我们决定成为苹果家族的一员。</p><p>我们对如何保持和发扬我们享有盛誉的历史进行了长时间的思考，并寻找能够进一步推进我们使命的合作伙伴，以及一个扩大的全球平台，将古典音乐带给世界各地的新听众。 Apple 拥有悠久的创新历史和对音乐的热爱，是开启下一个古典时代的理想家园，并表现出对建设古典音乐与技术和谐相处的未来的真正承诺。我们都是这个未来的一部分，这是我的愿景和我最真诚的梦想。</p></blockquote><p>现在<em>这</em>是一次苹果式的收购。 （ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/apples-bis-acquisition-is-a-bet-on-a-classical-music-catalogue-and-on-building-cred-in-the-industry/">来自 TechCrunch 的 Ingrid Lunden</a> 。）</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Apple 收购古典音乐专业唱片公司 BIS Records”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/apple-bis">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>英国暂时放弃禁止端到端加密的立法</title><link href="https://www.ft.com/content/770e58b1-a299-4b7b-a129-bded8649a43b" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v16" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/uk-encryption-win" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40218</id><published> 2023-09-06T16:56:18Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T17:06:59Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>克里斯蒂娜·克里德尔 (Cristina Criddle)、安娜·格罗斯 (Anna Gross) 和约翰·阿格里恩比 (John Aglionby) 在伦敦为《金融时报》报道：</p><blockquote><p>英国政府承认，在“技术上可行”之前，不会使用在线安全法案中有争议的权力来扫描消息应用程序中的有害内容，从而推迟了批评者认为威胁用户隐私的措施。</p><p>在周三下午向上议院发表的一份声明中，初级艺术和遗产大臣斯蒂芬·帕金森勋爵试图在最后一刻努力结束与包括 WhatsApp 在内的科技公司的对峙，这些公司威胁要从英国撤回服务。英国声称这对数百万用户的隐私和安全构成了无法容忍的威胁。</p><p>帕金森表示，技术监管机构 Ofcom 仅在开发出能够扫描网络的技术时才会要求公司扫描其网络。许多安全专家认为，如果有的话，此类技术可能还需要数年时间才能开发出来。</p></blockquote><p><em>不，周四就结束了。永远不怎么样——<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/the-story-of-how-about-never">永远对你没有好处</a>吗？</em></p><blockquote><p> Facebook 母公司 Meta 旗下的 WhatsApp 和另一款流行的加密通讯应用 Signal 均威胁称，如果它们被勒令削弱加密功能，它们将退出英国市场。加密是一种广泛使用的安全技术，只允许消息的发送者和接收者进行操作。查看消息的内容。 [...]</p><p>据几位了解政府想法的人士透露，官员们私下向科技公司承认，目前还没有一种技术能够扫描端到端加密消息，同时又不会损害用户的隐私。</p></blockquote><p>这并不是关于加密和立法者关于“只有好人才能访问的后门”的幻想的最糟糕的报告，但它从根本上具有误导性。端到端加密的含义就在它的名字中。没有可以从“弱”到“强”调节的旋钮。端点之间没有内容检查选项。这并不是选择不允许窃听者，而是实施技术上无法检查发送者和接收者之间的内容的协议。</p><p>实际的数学要复杂得多，但最终归结为英国承认 2 + 2 只能等于 4。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接到“英国”暂时放弃禁止端到端加密的立法”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/uk-encryption-win">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>滚石乐队：“愤怒”</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mEC54eTuGw" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v15" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/stones-angry" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40217</id><published> 2023-09-06T16:53:27Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T16:53:28Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Horace Dediu 在新近焕然一新的 Asymco 上写道：</p><blockquote><p>这样图片就变得更清晰了。 iPhone 客户的价值是 Android 客户的<em>7.4 倍</em>。这比我 10 年前的 4× 规则更令人印象深刻。原因主要是我的轶事来自在美国或欧盟销售产品的开发商，而智能手机向全球 70 亿用户的扩张吸引了更多低消费客户。</p><p>但苹果的用户群也已增长至超过 10 亿（6.5 亿商店用户）。这凸显出苹果公司有效地发展<em>和</em>区分了客户。它不仅获得了10亿客户，而且获得<em>了最好的</em>10亿客户。</p><p>如何有效区分是营销的圣杯。天真的做法是保持高价格。但这通常只会导致“豪华”品牌和往往无法增长的小基数。另一种“高级”方法是提供功能、多层、分销选项以及融资和销售。没有简单的公式。</p></blockquote><p>我真的很喜欢这篇文章，但我会质疑“没有简单的公式”。<em>执行起来</em>既困难又复杂。但从高层次来看，苹果公司为 iPhone（和 iPad）取得空前成功而采用的公式非常简单。</p><p>首先，做一些人们深切关心的事情。计算机是工业革命以来人类社会最大的进步；<em>革命</em>是一个很强烈的词，但它在当时适用，在今天也同样适用。人们非常关心他们的计算机以及他们在计算机上所做的事情，并且他们最关心最个人化的个人计算机：他们的手机。他们将其用于通信、摄影、娱乐（音乐和视频）、游戏等。他们几乎每天都带着它们去任何地方，并睡在它们旁边。</p><p>其次，为人们深切关心的事情制作最好的版本。最关心的人会认识到你的产品的优越性，并乐意（而不是勉强）为此支付溢价。</p><p>第三，不断迭代，<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">孜孜不倦，持续不断</a>，年复一年地改进产品。重点关注无法复制或模仿的方面。以 iPhone 为例，这些因素包括定制芯片、卓越的硬件组件和制造技术、 <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-deep-history-of-your-apps-steve-jobs-nextstep-and-early-object-oriented-programming/">数十年</a>制作的软件框架、优先考虑出色设计的文化，以及不断扩大的生态系统，<em>通过让客户满意而留住他们。</em> 。建造一座他们不想离开的豪华度假村，而不是一座他们无法离开的监狱。</p><p>不要优先考虑成为第一或最便宜。优先考虑成为最好的。这是一个简单的策略。这是极其艰难的执行。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“Horace Dediu：‘客户的价值’”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/dediu-value-of-a-customer">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>苹果应该停止在 Twitter 上投放广告吗？ </title><link href="https://technovia.co.uk/2023/09/04/its-long-past.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v13" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40215</id><published> 2023-09-05T20:39:37Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T20:39:38Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>伊恩·贝特里奇：</p><blockquote><p>苹果非常善于在轻松的情况下表明自己的立场。它拒绝在其应用商店上架各种小型右翼社交平台，因为内容审核政策不合格。与此同时，尽管 Twitter 无法实际控制仇恨言论，而且其所有者也积极鼓励仇恨言论，但它还是获得了通行证。</p><p>我们是否应该考虑抵制苹果和其他在 Twitter 上做广告的公司？让我们换个方式思考：如果您发现一家公司正在积极资助仇恨言论，您会想从他们那里购买产品吗？</p><p>我知道我不会。</p></blockquote><p>毫无疑问，贝特里奇认为苹果公司在这方面处于困境，这是正确的。如果你认为这很容易，请回想一下去年，当时苹果因应用商店的政策而激怒了马斯克。<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/30/cook-musk-apple-park">正如我当时所写的那样</a>，“让你的朋友更亲近，让你的敌人更亲近。”</p><p>但很难想象在任何其他广告场所——网站、广告牌、杂志、电视频道——苹果会在其中投放与<a href="https://twitter.com/k_pendergrast/status/1697385443040653479">这样的广告</a>一起投放的广告。无需声明。只需停止在 Twitter/X 上投放广告，并停止为<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/29/hashmoji-iphone-15-apple-event/">这些促销“hashflags”</a>付费即可。当不可避免地被问到原因时，请回答苹果的最佳回应方式：不予置评。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“苹果应该停止在 Twitter 上投放广告吗？”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title>每日喊“狼来了”的小马斯克声称 Twitter/X 将起诉反诽谤联盟</title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/04/elon-musk-to-sue-adl-for-falsely-accusing-him-x-of-antisemitism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v12" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40214</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:51:58Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T02:00:12Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Rebecca Bellan，TechCrunch 报道：</p><blockquote><p>在你可能错过的最新骚乱中，埃隆·马斯克表示，X（前身为 Twitter）将对反诽谤联盟提起诽谤诉讼。马斯克指责 ADL 这个致力于打击反犹太主义、极端主义和偏执的组织错误地指控他和 X 反犹太主义。</p><p> “为了在反犹太主义问题上洗清我们平台的名声，看来我们别无选择，只能对反诽谤联盟提起诽谤诉讼……哦，讽刺！”这位亿万富翁名人周一在推特上<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698828606598734225">写道</a>。</p><p>马斯克还将 X 美国广告收入下降归咎于 ADL。 “我们美国的广告收入仍然下降了 60%，主要是因为 @ADL（广告商告诉我们的）对广告商的压力，所以他们差点就成功干掉了 X/Twitter！”<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698755938541330907">马斯克说</a>。</p><p>马斯克在最近的长篇大论中声称自己支持言论自由，但“反对任何形式的反犹太主义”。</p></blockquote><p>马斯克声称他会做各种疯狂的事情。有时他真的会这么做，比如有一次他说他要收购 Twitter 并将其私有化。但大多数时候，他不这样做。我们需要停止报道他所说的话，而主要关注他所做的事情。就在两周前，当马斯克宣布 Twitter/X 将取消屏蔽功能时<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">，我开始使用这个标题戏剧来讲述众所周知的“狼来了”的小男孩</a>。他可能仍然会接受这个威胁，但它还没有发生，而且我怀疑它不会发生。</p><p>那么为什么我要把这种针对 ADL 的威胁联系起来呢？因为已经发生的事情是令人厌恶且值得注意的。周末流行的“BanTheADL”标签不仅没有被压制，反而得到了马斯克本人的支持。现在，这种“<em>都是犹太人的错</em>”的借口，以诉讼威胁的形式出现——如果马斯克真的跟进并提起诉讼（这将是一场无意义的诉讼），那并不重要，损害的是 Twitter 最受欢迎的用户——碰巧拥有它的人——正在公开讨好反犹太主义者。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“每日喊‘狼来了’的小马斯克声称 Twitter/X 将起诉反诽谤联盟”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Michael Flarup 的《MacOS 应用程序图标书》 </title><link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-macos-app-icon-book" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v11" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40213</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:06:46Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T19:06:47Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Studio Neat 充满活力的二人组新推出：Keen，一款价值 95 美元的美工刀。</p><p>是的，一把美工刀/美工刀，售价约为 100 美元。一款价值 100 美元的工具，可以取代<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lnchett-12-Pack-Retractable-Cardboard-Mechanism/dp/B07DXTP9M9/?tag=df-amzn-20">一次性产品</a>，每支售价 1 美元。直到大约一年前，我还用过那些一次性塑料工作服，但我一直在丢失它们。大约一年前，在失去了办公室里最后一个的踪迹后，我突然意识到我失去了它们，因为我不关心它们。我已经拥有了 The James Brand 的一把漂亮的钥匙扣大小的小刀，我很喜欢它，所以我买了<a href="https://thejamesbrand.com/products/the-palmer">Palmer</a> ，他们的美工刀 59 美元。 11 个月过去了，我一次也没有放错过它。我很高兴拥有它：它比我用过的任何一次性用品都好用。</p><p>不过，几周前，我在 Studio Neat 的朋友给我发了一份预制作的《Keen》。从各方面来说，我都更喜欢它而不是 Palmer。首先，它更薄更小，但绝不<em>太小</em>。其次，更换刀片更容易。但最重要的是，Keen 提供了用于打开和关闭刀片的完全原创设计：弹簧滑块。它与我见过的任何美工刀设计都非常不同，我想知道我是否会喜欢它，更不用说喜欢它了，因为它没有锁定到位。事实证明我<em>更</em>喜欢它。它感觉更方便、更安全，因为当你不握住刀片时，不可能让刀片伸出。当释放时，它会快速弹回，如果你将其掉落，刀片会在落地时缩回。</p><p>钢笔非常便宜，您可以在大多数银行柜台免费获得，但许多关心钢笔的人会花更多钱才能买到一支非常好的钢笔。 （实际上，如果您有兴趣，Studio Neat 也为您提供了<a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone">Mark One</a>和<a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/marktwo">Mark Two</a>的产品。就我个人而言，我仍然热衷于<a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/6387">1.75 美元的 Zebra Sarasa</a> 。）开箱刀也不例外。考虑到我一年中每周收到的包裹数量，它是我最常用的工具之一。那么为什么不买最好的呢？ Kickstarter 上的资金已经充足，但最终的零售价将比 Kickstarter 上的价格高出 25 美元左右。</p><p>也可以看看：</p><ul><li><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5bFsyRSTp4">Chase Reeves 制作了一个关于 Keen 的有趣的 YouTube 小视频</a>。</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C3J93DWH/?tag=df-amzn-20">这些陶瓷实用剃须刀刀片</a>比钢刀片更锋利，据说使用寿命更长，并且与 Keen 配合得特别好，因为它们不会被 Keen 的磁力闭合所吸引。</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="永久链接“Studio Neat’s Keen：世界上最好的切箱机”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/studio-neat-keen">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://ohdear.app/?via=daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0z" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/09/oh_dear" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/feeds/sponsors//11.40211</id><author><name>大胆火球商务部</name></author><published>2023-09-04T21:46:16Z</published><updated> 2023-09-04T21:46:17Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-thunderbolt-cable/">蒂姆·哈德威克（Tim Hardwick）为 MacRumors 撰稿</a>：</p><blockquote><p> Apple 可能会为 iPhone 15 Pro 型号提供 USB-C 数据传输配件电缆，该电缆能够实现高达 40Gbps 的 Thunderbolt 或 USB4 速度。这是<a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1694893349705240598">Kosutami 的最新说法</a>，他在 Twitter（现在的 X）上发布了该电报的详细信息。据爆料者称，该线缆长度为 0.8 米，比<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN713AM/A/thunderbolt-4-pro-cable-18-m">苹果现有的 Thunderbolt 4 Pro 线缆</a>（1.8m）还要短，据称最高支持 150W 充电。据称，苹果将单独出售该电缆。</p></blockquote><p>以免您认为 Apple 单独销售 Thunderbolt 4 电缆很划算，请注意，Thunderbolt 4 电缆非常<em>昂贵</em>。<a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/thunderbolt-cable">苹果目前出售两款</a>：180 万颗的售价为 129 美元，300 万颗的售价为 159 美元。我去年买了一把 Razor 生产的 80 万块，感觉和质量与苹果的非常相似，<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TGBF6DK/?tag=df-amzn-20">亚马逊目前售价 46 美元</a>。 （如果您正在市场上购买 Thunderbolt 4 电缆，这是一个让我致富的附属链接。）Monoprice 的 1m Thunderbolt 电缆（橡胶，非编织）<a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=44117">售价 30 美元</a>。苹果自己的 80 万条 Thunderbolt 3 电缆售价 39 美元。我猜测 Apple 推出的这款新型 0.8m Thunderbolt 4 线缆售价为 99 美元。对于苹果来说，为每部 iPhone 15 Pro 配备一条昂贵（又粗、又硬、又短）的数据线是非常愚蠢的。</p><p>提供这样的电缆并在手机上提供 Thunderbolt 4 性能的原因是为了数据传输，特别是视频传输。直到今年 iPhone 仍然坚持使用 Lightning，最大的挫败感是 4K 视频文件<em>非常</em>大，但 USB 2.0 数据传输<em>非常</em>慢。 iPhone从2015年的6S机型开始就能够拍摄4K视频，随着图像质量逐年提高，Lightning的数据传输限制似乎越来越不协调。 <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-29">1</a></sup></p><p>当我们<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg9F1Qjv3iU&amp;t=6s">在 2020 年</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SzbucgATjA">和 2021 年</a>使用 iPhone 拍摄 WWDC 远程脱口秀节目的新冠时代剧集时，我遇到过两次这种情况。这段视频看起来很棒，但从手机上传输下来需要几个小时。迄今为止，iPhone 提供的专业品质摄像机仅限于消费者级别的数据传输速率。</p><p>不过，说到“专业版”，更快的数据传输速度可能确实是今年 P Pro 的主要功能。哈德威克继续说道：</p><blockquote><p>因此，关于 iPhone 15 系列的 USB-C 端口功能的猜测仍然盛行，除了从 Lightning 端口切换到 USB-C 端口之外，没有什么是确定的。有传言称，iPhone 15 包装盒中提供的电缆<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-usb-c-cable-usb2-transfer-speeds/">仅限于 USB 2.0 数据传输速度</a>，为 480 MBps，与 Lightning 相同。</p><p>相比之下，根据郭最初的说法，iPhone 15 Pro 机型预计将配备具有 USB 3.2 或 Thunderbolt 3 传输速度的电缆。 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/some-iphone-15-models-feature-thunderbolt-speeds/">ChargerLab</a>的图像显示，部分 iPhone 15 型号将配备 Thunderbolt/USB 4 重定时器芯片，这似乎证实了 Pro 型号的更高速数据传输的传言。</p><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/">据报道，</a>每台 iPhone 15 的包装盒中都会包含一条编织 USB-C 充电线，该充电线比当前 iPhone 型号附带的 Lightning 线更粗（即更耐用）且长 50%。据传，这些电缆的<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">颜色</a>与可能的<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/five-iphone-15-color-options-to-expect/">新 iPhone 颜色</a>相匹配，至少有黑色、白色、黄色、蓝色和橙色。</p></blockquote><p>即使大多数 Pro 型号 iPhone 买家也从不通过电缆传输数据，因此以这种方式将 iPhone 15 Pro 型号与非 Pro 型号区分开来感觉很公平。所有新型号都配备颜色匹配的编织电缆将是一个不错的选择（并且与其他最新产品保持一致，例如 M1 iMac 和 M2 MacBook Air，均配备颜色匹配的编织电缆）。但事实上，其中一些手机（非专业版）可能仅支持 USB 2 速度（480 Mbps），而其他手机（专业版）将支持高达 Thunderbolt 4（40 Gbps - 大约快 80 倍），但所有端口和电缆连接器在肉眼看来都是一样的，这只表明“USB-C”是多么令人困惑。 Glenn Fleishman 2021 年的标题仍然一如既往地贴切：“ <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/12/03/usbefuddled-untangling-the-rats-nest-of-usb-c-standards-and-cables/">USBefuddled：解开 USB-C 标准和电缆的鼠巢</a>”。</p><hr /><p>在我撰写有关转向 USB-C 的文章时，让我预测一下当两周后正式宣布时，人们的反应会如何。使用 iPhone 拍摄的少数电影制片人（与 iPhone 用户总数相比较少）将会感到高兴。大量的书呆子，甚至是半书呆子，他们携带多个计算设备旅行并且只希望所有设备上都有 USB-C 充电连接器，他们会很高兴。但绝大多数沉默的普通iPhone用户呢？我认为大多数 USB-C 支持者都不会预见到会出现强烈反对，因为有人指责这一转变是苹果公司的圈钱行为，目的是让人们用<a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/usb-c-cable?src=globalnav">来自苹果公司的 30 美元新 USB-C 电缆</a>替换所有的 Lightning 电缆。<a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/usb-c-cable?src=globalnav">苹果商店</a>。</p><p>亲爱的读者，<em>您</em>当然知道 USB-C 是一种行业标准，您可以从 Apple 以外的<a href="https://www.monoprice.com/category/cables/usb-&amp;-lightning-cables/usb-c-cables">商店</a>购买<a href="https://www.anker.com/collections/usb-c?ref=naviMenu">高质量的电缆</a>。我想不是每个人都知道这一点。即使是那些从苹果以外的公司购买新 USB-C 充电线的人也可能会抱怨是否需要购买新充电线。</p><p>当苹果公司在 2012 年将 iPhone 5 的 30 针 iPod 连接器改用 Lightning 接口时，引起了<em>很多</em>抱怨。那是一个端口交换机，你可以很容易地<em>看到</em>新的有多好。 （旧的 30 针连接器和端口在现代人看来确实很荒谬。）乍一看，USB-C 看起来并不比 Lightning 更好，也几乎没有什么不同。我的直觉是，自 2012 年以来，“新 iPhone 连接器”方面并没有发生太大变化，除了事实上，现在的 iPhone 用户比当时多了 10 亿多，因此，现有的 Lightning 电缆可能<em>有数十亿条</em>。使用。典型用户更看重的是能够继续使用他们已经拥有的旧电缆（和充电器） <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-29">2</a></sup> — 在他们的床边、在他们的厨房、在他们的桌子上、在他们的汽车里、在他们的背包和钱包里——而不是减少数量他们生活中需要的不同<em>类型</em>的电缆。</p><p>我不知道有多少人会对这种转变感到恼火，甚至是彻头彻尾的愤怒，但人数会比大多数“ <em>iPhone 应该已经切换到 USB-C</em> ”支持者预期的要<em>多</em><sup id="fnr3-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-29">3</a></sup> 。对于我来说，我很乐意接受大大提高的数据传输速度。但我不会接听 1-800-MY-APPLE 电话。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-29"><p> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2391101/what-it-was-like-filming-unsane-on-an-iphone-according-to-the-cast">史蒂文·索德伯格 (Steven Soderbergh) 于 2017 年使用 iPhone 7 拍摄了故事片<em>《Unsane》</em></a> 。它看起来很棒——故意带有颗粒感，以复古 16 毫米电影的方式——但令人难以置信的是，他们花了多少时间等待从 iPhone 上传输素材。 <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 1。">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-29"><p>值得注意的是，许多 iPhone 用户<em>将</em>能够继续使用现有的充电线——如果他们一直使用 MagSafe 而不是 Lightning。我认为这是苹果等了这么久才将 iPhone 切换到 USB-C 的最大原因。 （iPad Pro 五年前从 Lightning 切换到了。）我认为他们想先推出 MagSafe，让人们在给 iPhone 充电的地方积累一些 MagSafe 电缆，然后从 Lightning 切换到 USB-C。三年的 iPhone（12、13、14）已经配备了 MagSafe，因此这大约是大多数用户的平均升级周期。但有趣的是，我家里的普通人不使用 MagSafe，他们使用 Lightning，可能是因为电缆更便宜。 <a href="#fnr2-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 2。">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3-2023-08-29"><p>还有更多“看看苹果强迫 iPhone 用户购买什么”的标题。 <a href="#fnr3-2023-08-29"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="跳回到文中的脚注 3。">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ 人们普遍猜测即将推出的 iPhone 15 将改用 USB-C 端口</title></entry><entry><link href="https://www.jigx.com?utm_source=fireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0s" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/08/jigx_1" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/feeds/sponsors//11.40204</id><author><name>大胆火球商务部</name></author><published>2023-08-29T18:19:21Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T18:19:21Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Apple 的开发者新闻网站对三位参观过 Vision Pro 实验室的独立开发者进行了精彩采访，其中包括来自<a href="https://flexibits.com/">Flexibits</a>的 Michael Simmons 和因<a href="https://www.david-smith.org/apps/">Widgetsmith</a>而闻名的 David “Underscore” Smith：</p><blockquote><p>就西蒙斯而言，他认为 Fantastical 的工作是开箱即用的。他将这些实验室描述为未来探索的“试验场”，也是推动软件超越当前界限的机会。 “有边框的屏幕可能会受到限制。当然，你可以滚动，或者拥有多个显示器，但一般来说，你只能看到边缘，”他说。 “体验空间计算不仅验证了我们一直在思考的设计——它帮助我们开始思考，不仅仅是从左到右或从上到下，而是超越边界。”</p></blockquote><p>西蒙斯的言论呼应了我从演示体验中获得的最大收获：缺少包含窗口的“框架”。</p><blockquote><p> And as not just CEO but the lead product designer (and the guy who “still comes up with all these crazy ideas”), he came away from the labs with a fresh batch of spatial thoughts. “Can people look at a whole week spatially? Can people compare their current day to the following week? If a day is less busy, can people make that day wider? And then, what if like you have the whole week wrap around you in 360 degrees?” he says. “I could probably — not kidding — talk for two hours about this.”</p></blockquote><p> Two hours, you say? <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/04/30/ep-345">I know a guy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inside the Apple Vision Pro Developer Labs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/inside-vision-developer-labs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface </title><link href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40200</id><published> 2023-08-28T18:45:16Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T21:58:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Remember <em>last</em> year at WWDC, when Apple previewed the next generation of CarPlay, with support for screens that span the entire dashboard? Here&#39;s a MotorTrend report on the 2024 Porsche Cayenne SUV. <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay?slide=2">Slide 2</a> shows a CarPlay interface that I had first wrongly presumed spans the entire dashboard, but in fact does not.</p><p> <strong>Update 1:</strong> A few readers have chimed in to suggest this is <em>not</em> next-gen CarPlay 2, it&#39;s just extended use of CarPlay 1. It&#39;s definitely improved, but it is not the new stuff Apple previewed last June. My question: If this is <em>not</em> CarPlay 2, when, if ever, will we actually see a carmaker announce CarPlay 2 support? ( <em>Voice from the cheap seats: “When Apple makes their own car.”</em> )</p><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/28/hands-on-porsche-new-carplay-app/">Here&#39;s a hands-on report by Jameson Dow</a> for 9to5Mac from last month:</p><blockquote><p> We got a chance to test out some of its features on a 2024 Cayenne, and it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve felt an Apple-like experience from software made by a traditional automaker.</p><p> We&#39;re still waiting for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/03/new-carplay-interface-features-release/">next-gen CarPlay experience</a> which Apple announced last year, which promises greater integration with vehicle functions than today&#39;s version of CarPlay. In the meantime, though, Porsche has taken it upon itself to build its own app which offers the best of both worlds — a snappy, CarPlay-like user interface, along with control of some vehicle functions which were heretofore unavailable through Apple&#39;s software.</p></blockquote><p> So it might be the best CarPlay interface yet to ship in a car, but it&#39;s <em>not</em> the next-gen CarPlay announced by Apple last year. It&#39;s just CarPlay in the middle with other displays showing built-in stuff from Porsche based on <a href="https://www.porscheirvine.com/research/porsche-communication-management.htm">PCM</a> , their own in-house software platform.</p><p> <strong>Update 3:</strong> I&#39;ve now received feedback from three different readers who&#39;ve all said more or less the same thing: they paid extra for these extra screens in their Cayennes or Taycans, and the software experience on them is terrible. They regret paying for it. “A wasted useless screen” said one.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40199</id><published> 2023-08-28T17:28:39Z</published><updated> 2023-08-28T17:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.

<p>Clay Risen, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> John Warnock, a founder of Adobe Systems whose innovations in computer graphics, including the ubiquitous PDF, made possible today&#39;s visually rich digital experiences, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 82.</p><p> The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started in 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.</p></blockquote><p> It was just a month ago that pancreatic cancer took Kevin Mitnick, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip">I remarked</a> on how many people this specific cancer has taken of late.</p><blockquote><p> Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an arduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on either a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or a specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $10,000 and take up most of a room.</p><p> Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop printers themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer sent them. Adobe&#39;s first such protocol, PostScript, went into Apple&#39;s revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a few years it was the industry standard.</p><p> PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware companies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely unknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a program designed to render and read files in what it called a Portable Document Format, or PDF.</p></blockquote><p> PDF was an enormous breakthrough, and is more relevant today than ever. A true document format for the ages. But Adobe was well on its way before 1993. <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/02/20/a-blast-from-the-past-demos-of-adobe-photoshop-1-0/">Photoshop 1.0 launched in early 1990</a> . They began shipping their library of original <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5141">PostScript fonts and the essential Adobe Type Manager software</a> in 1989. And Illustrator 1.0 launched back in 1987, shipping with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjPTMfVBDh0">this video tour demonstrated by Warnock himself</a> .</p><p> Warnock and Geschke understood what Steve Jobs often preached: technology alone was not enough. PostScript was — <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html">and remains</a> ! — excellent technology. But it was not a product. The LaserWriter was a product. You hooked it up, went to File → Print in <em>any</em> application, and you got professional-grade 300 DPI output with no technical expertise necessary. It was as easy to print high-quality output on a LaserWriter as it was to print junk output on a slow, noisy dot-matrix printer. <em>That</em> was a product.</p><p> And Illustrator turned PostScript from a rather difficult but highly-capable programming language into a tool designed for use by artists. They didn&#39;t just make a nice code editor for writing PostScript. They created an app that presented a visual framework in which you directly manipulated shapes, lines, and curves as objects. Even expert Illustrator users were never exposed to PostScript directly. The Illustrator metaphor was a complete <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/eps-file.html">encapsulation</a> . That too was a product, and Illustrator remains an essential tool. If Warnock and Geschke had been satisfied merely with shipping great technology alone, Adobe Systems would be a nearly forgotten Silicon Valley footnote. Instead, they pushed to make Adobe the great tool-making product company we know today.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Adobe Co-Founder John Warnock Dies at 82’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/26/john-warnock-rip">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Threads Web App Launches </title><link href="https://www.threads.net/@threads/post/CwVVlQlOe53" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/threads-web" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40196</id><published> 2023-08-25T23:16:06Z</published><updated> 2023-08-26T19:25:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> In the battle between iPad and Mac, I&#39;m a longtime member of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2016/02/ipad-vs-mac-im-on-team-both/">Team Both</a> — I use my Mac most of the day at my desk, but when I write elsewhere in the house or backyard, I switch to an iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard case. And that iPad (in a regular case) is my primary computing device when I&#39;m not in work mode.</p><p> I&#39;m not at all ready to declare the “use iPad to get work done” experiment dead. With the forthcoming release of iPadOS 17, Stage Manager has thrown in a bunch of improvements that suggest the iPad&#39;s progression to more functional status continues, albeit at a pace that&#39;s a bit too slow for my liking.</p><p> But here I sit at my mother&#39;s dining room table, typing on a MacBook Air. Something has changed in my approach to travel, and I&#39;m trying to understand just what it is and what it tells me about the trajectory of the iPad as a productivity tool.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve written <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air">at length</a> , multiple times, about my decidedly mixed feelings regarding the iPad — most stridently in January 2020, in a piece titled “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10">The iPad Awkwardly Turns 10</a> ”. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/stage+manager">Stage Manager</a> is the biggest change to the iPad interface since I wrote that, and its existence certainly helps on that “power user” front. (And Stage Manager sees some <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/with-ipados-17-stage-manager-is-finally-moving-in-the-right-direction/">nice improvements</a> in this year&#39;s iPadOS 17.) But for me personally, I continue to find that I&#39;m most productive when I spend my working time in front of my Mac. Gobs of people thrive using their iPads for writing and other creative endeavors. But I know I&#39;m best off, productivity-wise, using my iPad basically as a single-tasking consumption device for long-form reading and video watching.</p><p> The reason this topic remains evergreen is that I <em>want</em> to use my iPad more. There&#39;s something ineffable about it. It&#39;s a thrill when I use my iPad to do something that an iPad is actually best at. I honestly think I&#39;d be more productive if I owned no iPad at all, yet I keep trying to find ways to use it more.</p><p> So when I travel, it&#39;s never a question whether I&#39;ll pack my MacBook Pro. Even if I don&#39;t plan or want to work during a particular trip, the one-man-show nature of Daring Fireball means I feel that I need to be able to. (I was on a family vacation, preparing to head to dinner, when <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned">this news broke 12 years ago yesterday</a> .) The question is whether I even pack my iPad Pro at all, or just go it alone with iPhone and Mac. When I&#39;m packing, I generally wind up tossing the iPad in my bag, thinking I&#39;ll miss it if I don&#39;t. But when I do just leave the iPad at home, I don&#39;t miss it. It&#39;s confounding, though, because I&#39;m going on a trip next week and I bet I&#39;ll take my damn iPad.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Giving Up the iPad-Only Travel Dream’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/ipad-only-travel-dream">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Lends Support to California &#39;Right to Repair&#39; Bill </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/?guccounter=1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40194</id><published> 2023-08-25T00:50:13Z</published><updated> 2023-08-25T22:46:08Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Brian Heater, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> In a surprise move, Apple this week penned a letter to California state senator Susan Talamantes Eggman, voicing support for SB 244, a “right to repair” bill currently making its way through Sacramento&#39;s State Capitol building. [...] Apple has, of course, softened its stance on right to repair legislation in recent years, including last year&#39;s addition of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/iphone-14-and-m2-macs-get-added-to-apples-self-service-repair-program/">Self Service Repair program</a> . The offering, which was viewed by many as a preemptive measure against looming state and federal legislation, provides users with rental tools to repair iPhones and Macs at home.</p><p> In the letter, Apple expresses its support on the grounds of offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, without risking privacy or data issues. “Apple supports California&#39;s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “We create our products to last and, if they ever need to be repaired, Apple customers have a growing range of safe, high-quality repair options.”</p><p> This sort of backing from a specific manufacturer is unusual — particularly from Apple. It is thus far the only major manufacturer to express its support for the bill in this manner. These kinds of statements are generally made through industry consortiums, such as TechNet.</p></blockquote><p> I don&#39;t find Apple&#39;s support for this legislation surprising, but <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230823/p29#a230823p29">most people commenting on it do</a> .</p><p> <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110943929863426254">Dare Obasanjo</a> :</p><blockquote><p> This is less of a pivot and more of just accepting reality.</p><p> Apple pushing aesthetics such as no seams in their phones over consumer benefits like being able to replace your phone&#39;s batteries has been deemed unacceptable by a number of governments including the EU.</p><p> Regulation is coming whether they like it or not, so they might as well get some positive PR for “supporting” the regulations.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/">Jason Koebler, writing at 404 Media</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple told a California legislator that it is formally supporting a right to repair bill in California, a landmark move that suggests big tech manufacturers understand they have lost the battle to monopolize repair, and need to allow consumers and independent repair shops to fix their own electronics.</p></blockquote><p> Koebler&#39;s use of “monopoly” hints at the assumption that authorized repairs are a profit center. That is true for some manufacturers in some industries. Koebler himself has copiously documented <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware">the saga with John Deere tractors</a> . All <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">the nonsense</a> inkjet printer makers go through to try to keep people from using third-party replacement ink cartridges is another. That&#39;s never been Apple&#39;s reason for opposing these laws. Apple&#39;s stance is more about control.</p><p> And I&#39;d argue that Obasanjo is missing the possibility that Apple actually thinks California&#39;s SB 244 is a well-written law. Would Apple prefer no such law at all? I think the answer is obviously yes. Providing all the necessary documentation, tools, and parts for every new device the company makes is a pain in Apple&#39;s corporate ass, and I think <em>that’s</em> why Apple resisted such legislation. From their perspective any such law is an unnecessary annoyance. But it&#39;s undeniably reasonable for there to be consumer protection laws, and if there are going to be Right to Repair laws that cover computing devices, those laws ought to be good ones. And the plain language of Apple&#39;s letter is that the company thinks this is a good one.</p><p> I highly doubt we&#39;re going to see any such letter from Apple to the EU endorsing their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/25/22996248/apple-sideloading-apps-store-third-party-eu-dma-requirement">Digital Markets Act</a> , the law that, among numerous other sweeping provisions, is poised to mandate sideloading on all phones. Apple continues to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/23/apple-opposes-eu-plans-to-make-common-charger-port-for-all-devices">oppose</a> the EU law requiring USB-C ports in all rechargeable devices, and that law is already passed. Apple has complied, begrudgingly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with the Netherlands&#39;s rather specific regulations regarding dating apps</a> and in-app payments — but they&#39;ve issued no praise for the law.</p><p> If Apple <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23925286-apple-support-sb-244">says they support California&#39;s SB 244</a> , it probably just means they actually support it.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Lends Support to California ‘Right to Repair’ Bill’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Apple Buying Disney Isn&#39;t the Fairy Tale It Once Was&#39; </title><link href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2032120/apple-disney-merger-netflix-growth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/snell-apple-disney" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40193</id><published> 2023-08-24T22:14:23Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T22:14:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>A Jason Snell daily double — this time his Macworld column, speculating on rumors of an Apple acquisition of Disney:</p><blockquote><p> If this sounds outlandish, well, if I traveled back in time to 2011 and told you that Apple would be producing some of the best TV shows in the world, wouldn&#39;t that seem bizarre? And yet the company has grown and changed–and will continue to.</p><p> But leaving the growth aside for a moment, there&#39;s also this: Apple and Disney <em>do</em> have ties. They do feel similar in so many ways. From the Imagineers working on new Disneyland features to the VFX artists at Industrial Light &amp; Magic to the animators at Pixar, so much of Disney is located at the same intersection of Technology and the Liberal Arts that Apple calls home. (And when I look at the bill for my last family trip to Disneyland, I recognize that both companies are very good at charging me a lot of money.)</p></blockquote><p> Last week when I was working — slowly, as ever — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree">on my own take</a> on the Apple-Disney speculation, I saw in my feed reader that Snell had published his own take. So, I averted my eyes until I finished my own. Glad I did, because I&#39;m not sure I would have been able to resist lifting that keen observation about both companies residing at the intersection of Technology and the Liberal Arts. That&#39;s exactly why this whole notion, though unlikely, <em>feels</em> like a “but, well ... <em>maybe</em> ” idea.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Apple Buying Disney Isn’t the Fairy Tale It Once Was’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/snell-apple-disney">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;How the iMac Saved Apple&#39; </title><link href="https://www.theverge.com/23830432/imac-twenty-five-years-ago-saved-apple" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/how-the-imac-saved-apple" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40192</id><published> 2023-08-24T22:07:10Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T22:26:31Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing at The Verge last week, marking the iMac&#39;s 25th anniversary:</p><blockquote><p> Upon its release, the iMac became so well known that it may have even eclipsed the Apple brand for a little while. It was at least a strong enough signifier that Apple began using it on other products. The iBook laptop was an obvious choice, but in 2001, the company chose to reuse the branding for its new music player, the iPod.</p><p> The iPod didn&#39;t connect to the internet, but it didn&#39;t matter. Apple was declaring that the “i” stood for another cool Apple product you&#39;d want to buy, and people bought an awful lot of iPods. Apple began slapping the lowercase “i” in front of a lot of its hardware, software, and services, culminating in the release of the iPhone and iPad.</p></blockquote><p> An astute remembrance of a seminal product. Snell rightly emphasizes how controversial some of the iMac&#39;s features were: the lack of a floppy disk drive and dropping all legacy I/O ports in favor of USB. The branding power of that “i” prefix remains so strong that I still hear people calling Apple Watches “iWatches”.</p><p> In hindsight it seems obvious that Jobs and Ive would go on to create not just numerous great new products, but to do so in new (or at least new to Apple) product categories. But they had to start somewhere. The easiest way for Apple to have failed upon Jobs&#39;s return would have been to shoot for the moon out of the gate. The next big things would come. First, they rightly decided to focus on righting the ship that was Apple&#39;s <em>previous</em> big thing: a desktop personal computer. Everything the company has designed, built, and shipped since can be traced back to that Bondi Blue surprise.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘How the iMac Saved Apple’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/how-the-imac-saved-apple">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/kouvakas_uk_surveillance" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0f" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40191</id><published> 2023-08-24T01:20:01Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T01:20:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> What will actually happen, I believe, is that E2EE messaging platforms like WhatsApp (overwhelmingly popular in the UK), Signal, and iMessage *will stop working and be pulled from app stores in the UK*, full stop.

<p><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/87615/changes-to-uk-surveillance-regime-may-violate-international-law/">Ioannis Kouvakas, writing for Just Security</a> :</p><blockquote><p> While the proposal does not specify what technical changes would require notification, these may include changes in the architecture of software that would <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revised-investigatory-powers-act-notices-regimes-consultation/consultation-on-revised-notices-regimes-in-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016-accessible-version#proposed-changes">interfere</a> with the UK&#39;s current surveillance powers. As a result, an operator of a messaging service wishing to introduce an advanced security feature would now have to first let the Home Office know in advance. Device manufacturers would likely also have to notify the government before making available important <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66256081">security updates</a> that fix known vulnerabilities and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/managing-deployed-devices/keeping-devices-and-software-up-to-date">keep devices secure</a> . Accordingly, the Secretary of State, upon receiving such an advance notice, could now request operators to, for instance, abstain from patching security gaps to allow the government to maintain access for surveillance purposes.</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly where I&#39;ve thought, for months, that the United Kingdom is heading with this legislation, but it&#39;s still shocking to see it described so starkly. It&#39;s like watching someone drive toward a cliff, and warning people, “ <em>Hey, I think these guys are driving right toward that cliff</em> ” — and yet I&#39;m still taken aback to see them drive off the cliff.</p><p> It&#39;s a complete fantasy that E2EE can be toggled like a light switch and still allow messages to be delivered. The end-to-end encryption isn&#39;t a sugar coating, some sort of extra layer of protection — it&#39;s fundamental to the messaging protocols themselves. It has to be, when you think about it. If it were possible for, say, Signal, to silently disable E2EE but still have messages go through, how could users ever trust the service? You could neither trust that what you were sending would be delivered securely, nor that what you received wasn&#39;t intercepted by an interloper. There&#39;s an explicit guarantee with all of these E2EE messaging platforms <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">that messages can <em>only</em> go through securely</a> . Removing E2EE wouldn&#39;t require some mere tweak to the protocols, it would require replacing the protocols entirely (with inherently insecure ones).</p><p> And the notion that security updates, for every user in the world, would need the approval of the UK Home Office just to make sure the patches weren&#39;t closing vulnerabilities that the government itself is exploiting — it boggles the mind. Even if the UK were the only country in the world to pass such a law, it would be madness, but what happens when other countries follow?</p><p> As I see it, the most likely outcome is that the UK passes the law, <em>thinking</em> that the grave concerns conveyed to them by the messaging services are overblown. That the platform providers are saying they <em>can&#39;t</em> comply but they really just mean they don&#39;t <em>want</em> to comply because it&#39;s just difficult, not impossible. And when it becomes law, the platforms will hand it off to the nerds, the nerds will nerd harder, and boom, the platforms will fall into compliance with this law. That&#39;s what they <em>think</em> will happen. What will actually happen, I believe, is that E2EE messaging platforms like WhatsApp (overwhelmingly popular in the UK), Signal, and iMessage <em>will stop working and be pulled from app stores in the UK</em> , full stop. The UK seems to think it&#39;s a bluff; I don&#39;t.</p><p> Perhaps the argument — as made by Kouvakas — that these changes would run afoul of international law will resonate with the UK in a way that technical arguments, thus far, have not.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ &#39;Changes to UK Surveillance Regime May Violate International Law&#39;</title></entry><entry><title> Rewatch </title><link href="http://www.rewatch.com/resources/daring-fireball/?utm_source=daring-fireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=daring-fireball-newsletter-q3-2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0d" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/20/rewatch" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40189</id><published> 2023-08-20T04:39:24Z</published><updated> 2023-08-20T04:39:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Speaking of Twitter/X, Eric Seufert, writing on Threads:</p><blockquote><p> Twitter has seen a dramatic decrease in its Top Downloaded chart position across both platforms since the app was renamed to X. Why? The situation presents a fascinating case study at the intersection of brand equity and mobile platform dynamics.</p><p> The case is somewhat unprecedented: Twitter built a ubiquitous, household-name brand over the course of nearly 2 decades and then simply abandoned it, leaving it to be exploited by competitors, unopposed, through the mobile platforms&#39; branded search ads. [...]</p><p> My hypothesis is that, while the terminally-online are entirely aware of Twitter&#39;s rebrand to X, most consumers aren&#39;t, and their searches for “Twitter” on platform stores surface ads and genuine search results that are in no way redolent of Twitter.</p></blockquote><p> So if you don&#39;t know that Twitter changed its name to X, and search for “Twitter”, the top result is a paid ad from a competitor (Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, etc.), and the result for X doesn&#39;t look anything like Twitter. It doesn&#39;t have the name, doesn&#39;t say “formerly Twitter”, and isn&#39;t even blue. It&#39;s just the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@joannastern/post/CwAxVOGL8Cz/">ugly X icon</a> and the insipid slogan “Blaze your glory!”</p><p> At this moment, Threads is #2 on the App Store&#39;s top free downloads list, and X is #51. On the Play Store, Threads is #6 and X is ( <em>scroll, scroll, scroll...</em> ) #66. This rebranding would be a firing offense if the mastermind behind it didn&#39;t own the company.

<p>Joe Otterson, reporting for Variety with the shittiest news of the day:</p><blockquote><p> “ <a href="https://variety.com/t/the-peripheral/">The Peripheral</a> ” has been canceled at Amazon&#39;s Prime Video, Variety has learned. The news comes despite the fact that Amazon <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-peripheral-renewed-season-2-amazon-1235518073/">renewed the show for a second season</a> back in February. The series, based on the William Gibson novel of the same name, debuted on Amazon on Oct. 21, 2022.</p><p> It starred Chloë Grace Moretz and hailed from executive producers Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan under their rich overall deal with Amazon. According to an individual with knowledge of the situation, the decision to not move forward with the second season was heavily influenced by the ongoing writers and actors strikes. In essence, even if the show was to go back into production soon, Season 2 would not be available until close to if not into 2025. [...]</p><p> “The Peripheral” was the first series to debut under Nolan and Joy&#39;s deal with Amazon, which is reportedly worth $150 million. The duo are also prepping a series based on the video game franchise “Fallout,” though that project does not yet have a premiere date. Production was reportedly finished on the series earlier this year.</p></blockquote><p> This sucks. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-Season-1/dp/B0B8TFMYXZ">The Peripheral</a></em> season 1 was really good: smart, entertaining, surprising, great characters and cast. It looked good too. Nolan and Joy were the team behind HBO&#39;s <em>Westworld</em> , and <em>The Peripheral</em> was both stylistically and thematically similar — but just better. It&#39;s like Nolan and Joy took another crack at the same thing. It&#39;s so good I suggest watching it even knowing that there&#39;s no future, and thus it ends very unsatisfyingly.</p><p> I&#39;m pissed that Netflix dropped <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80214497">1899</a></em> after just one season, but knowing that <em>1899</em> has no future, I&#39;m a bit more reluctant to suggest watching it — it wasn&#39;t nearly as good as <em>The Peripheral</em> . But we&#39;re all <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">used to this from Netflix</a> . Sad to see Amazon go that route.</p><p> And I don&#39;t get how the writer and actor strikes justifies this decision at all — <em>everything</em> is going to be delayed by these strikes. This just seems like Amazon <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-05/amazon-ceo-asks-his-hollywood-studio-to-explain-its-big-spending?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=aPhxMSeh">getting cheap after they blew billions</a> on a shitty <em>Lord of the Rings</em> show and the big expensive letdown <em>Citadel</em> .

<p>Adi Robertson, reporting for The Verge:</p><blockquote><p> Elon Musk says X&#39;s — formerly Twitter&#39;s — block feature is on the chopping block, repeating his long-standing gripe against the basic social networking feature. “Block is going to be deleted as a &#39;feature&#39;, except for DMs,” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558414105186796">said in an X reply</a> on Friday. He followed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1692558493255942213">another post</a> : “It makes no sense.”</p></blockquote><p> Twitter founder and multi-time former CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1692583743884509668">Jack Dorsey</a> (capitalization <em>sic</em> ): “💯. mute only.”</p><p> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety">Apple&#39;s App Store Guidelines</a> :</p><blockquote><p> 1.2 User-Generated Content</p><p> Apps with user-generated content present particular challenges, ranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous bullying. To prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or social networking services must include:</p><ul><li> A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the app</li><li> A mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concerns</li><li> The ability to block abusive users from the service</li></ul></blockquote><p> Excerpted from <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9876937?hl=en">Google&#39;s Play Store Policy Center on “User Generated Content”</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apps that contain or feature UGC, including apps which are specialized browsers or clients to direct users to a UGC platform, must implement robust, effective, and ongoing UGC moderation that:</p><ul><li> Conducts UGC moderation, as is reasonable and consistent with the type of UGC hosted by the app; [...]</li><li> Provides an in-app system for reporting objectionable UGC and users, and takes action against that UGC and/or user where appropriate;</li><li> Provides an in-app system for blocking UGC and users;</li></ul></blockquote><p> Both platforms thus require social media apps to support users being able to block other users. Google&#39;s language is unambiguous. The rub is how “blocking” is defined. If all Musk wants to do is changing blocking to mean that blocked users can still <em>see</em> tweets from users who blocked them, but can&#39;t interact (reply, quote, retweet) with them, I think that&#39;s fine. Blocked users can see those tweets by just opening a private/incognito browser tab as it stands. But if Musk wants to truly “delete” the block feature, he&#39;s going to run right into Apple and Google&#39;s app store rules. Google is arguably stricter than Apple about enforcing UGC rules, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1129024148/google-truth-social-trump">having kept Donald Trump&#39;s Truth Social app out of the Play Store for months</a> (after it was available in Apple&#39;s App Store) citing insufficient content moderation.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Little Musk Who Cries ‘Wolf’ Daily Claims X Will ‘Delete’ the Block Feature, But No One Knows What That Even Means’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump Thinks Fox News Makes Him Look Fat and Orange </title><link href="https://politicalwire.com/2023/08/17/trump-thinks-fox-news-makes-him-look-fat-and-orange/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v09" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/trump-fat-orange" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40185</id><published> 2023-08-19T21:55:22Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T21:55:23Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Mark Gurman, in his Power On column for Bloomberg last week:</p><blockquote><p> Because of the Apple Watch&#39;s slow evolution over the years, the design has remained largely the same since the Series 4 launched in 2018 — aside from the Ultra model.</p></blockquote><p> The cause and effect is backwards here: Apple Watch has evolved slowly because the original design nailed it so well. There was a gentle form-factor change with Series 4, but at a glance, today&#39;s Series 8 (and, almost certainly, next month&#39;s Series 9) looks nearly identical to the original “Series 0” models. It&#39;s almost criminally under-remarked-upon just how good the original Apple Watch design was. 1993 Macs didn&#39;t look like the 1984 original Macintosh, except for the gimmicky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Color_Classic">Color Classic</a> that almost no one bought then and even fewer remember now. The iPhone underwent multiple major form factor revisions in its first decade: iPhone 4, 5, 6, and X. Yet here we are on the cusp of the 9th generation Apple Watch and the original design still looks fresh and remains band-compatible with the original models. But, says Gurman:</p><blockquote><p> But that&#39;s poised to change. Apple is planning a “Watch X” model to mark the device&#39;s 10-year anniversary, and it promises to be the biggest overhaul yet. (The category was unveiled in 2014 and released the following year, so Apple is planning to launch Watch X either in 2024 or 2025.) With the X model, Apple designers are working on a thinner watch case and have explored changing the way bands are attached to the device.</p><p> Starting with the original Apple Watch, bands have slid into the sides of the chassis and attached with a locking mechanism. Keeping that design the same let the bands stay compatible with old and new models, but it has downsides. People involved in the development of new Apple Watches say the system takes up a considerable amount of space that could be better filled with a bigger battery or other components.</p><p> To that end, the company has explored a new magnetic band attachment system, though it&#39;s unclear if it will be ready or used in the Watch X revamp. Even bigger changes are coming as well: a microLED display that tops the color and clarity of the current OLED screens, as well as a technology for monitoring blood pressure.</p></blockquote><p> Surely the band connectors will break backwards compatibility <em>eventually</em> , but it&#39;s worth noting that even the Apple Watch Ultra is band-compatible with the regular “large” Apple Watches.</p><p> If Apple goes with “X” in lieu of “10”, <em>a la</em> iPhone X, I&#39;d still bet on “Series X”, not just “X”. And we can take it to the bank that all this will happen, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/14/prosser-flat-edge-watch">just like we could when Gurman reported</a> , <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/29/apple-watch-series-7-size-faces-report/">two weeks before it was announced</a> in 2021, that Series 7 would have both a flat display and flat-sided case. (Series 7 watches in fact had <em>rounder</em> displays and the curvature of the cases didn&#39;t change a whit.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘All His Life Has He Looked Away, to the Future, to the Horizon.

<p>From a report published in Advances in Infectious Diseases by researchers at Florida Atlantic University, “Prevalence and Disinfection of Bacteria Associated with Various Types of Wristbands”:</p><blockquote><p> Wristbands, often worn daily without routine cleaning, may accumulate potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, the quantity and taxonomy of bacteria found on the wristbands in this experiment show that there is a need for regular and popular sanitation of these surfaces. Generally, it was found that rubber and plastic wristbands had higher bacterial counts, while metal ones, especially gold and silver, had little to no bacteria. Bacteria found were common skin residents, of the genera Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas, and intestinal symbionts, like of the genera Escherichia. The ability of many of these bacteria to significantly affect the health of immunocompromised hosts indicates a special need for healthcare workers and others in hospital environments to regularly sanitize these surfaces. Common household disinfectants, such as Lysol Disinfectant Spray, 70% Ethanol, and Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar all proved at least somewhat effective on all materials (rubber, plastic, cloth, and metal), although antibacterial efficacy was significantly increased at two minutes compared to thirty seconds.</p></blockquote><p> “Apple” appears 14 times in the report; all 14 are references to using apple cider vinegar as a cleanser.

<p>Zeke Faux, in an excerpt from his <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711959/number-go-up-by-zeke-faux/">new book</a> , <em>Number Go Up: Inside Crypto&#39;s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall</em> , published at Bloomberg ( <a href="https://apple.news/ArittvKC_ThmpTudKYeK4_Q">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Thuy was 29 but looked younger, with a thin mustache and wavy bangs that covered his forehead. When he opened his mouth to light a cigarette, he revealed that he was missing at least four front teeth—knocked out, he told me, by his captors in Cambodia. Sitting cross-legged on the green-tiled floor of his aunt&#39;s tiny apartment, we went over satellite photos of Chinatown. Thuy showed me the gates manned by guards and the areas the captive workers couldn&#39;t leave. He also pointed out a hotel with a gilded facade within the complex where he said the bosses were serviced by prostitutes.</p><p> He was eager to tell me more about his ordeal in Chinatown. He showed me a ragged scar behind his ear and one on his arm. And he brushed his bangs aside to point out a long lump on his forehead, from a fracture that was still healing.</p><p> Thuy told me he&#39;d only managed to arrange to be rescued because he&#39;d stolen a guard&#39;s iPhone and hid it inside his rectum. When the phone died, he took it apart without using any tools, peeled out the dead battery, charged it by hot-wiring it to a fluorescent light fixture, and used it to contact the YouTuber, who then paid the ransom. He offered to demonstrate the hot-wiring. We found a shop, where I bought a used phone for about $50. Then we went to my hotel, where, without hesitation, Thuy took apart an LED bulb in the lamp in my room. Using a USB cable he stripped with his teeth, he proceeded to wire the bulb to the iPhone&#39;s battery. When he reinstalled it, the phone powered on.</p><p> “I was very calm, no fear at all, because I thought that I would die either way,” Thuy told me. “If they found out I was the one stealing that phone, I would either be beaten up or killed. But if I managed to hide it, I would have a chance to live.”</p></blockquote><p> The “pig butchering” scam Faux describes works like this: Scammers pose as vivacious young Asian women. They spam WhatsApp and other messaging platforms with random “wrong messages” (I get such entreaties periodically, perhaps because my WhatsApp number is the same as my number for Signal, which I make public), then start flirting after apologizing for their “mistake”. Then, they drop that they happen to be profiting mightily from cryptocurrency trading, and encourage their marks to get into the action. Easy money. When the marks convert dollars into crypto (Tether, most commonly) and transfer the crypto to their new online girlfriends, the money, of course, goes to the Chinese gangsters running the racket. Worse still, the workers running the scams are captives enslaved in massive compounds, one of which Faux visits in Cambodia, the very one his source Thuy escaped from.</p><p> Seems like a crackerjack book.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Number Go Up’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/18/number-go-up">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_strategy_charts" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v05" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40181</id><published> 2023-08-18T03:59:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-19T21:52:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> Disney was, and should remain, a serious engineering company. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> co-host Ben Thompson referenced <a href="https://kottke.org/15/06/walt-disneys-corporate-strategy-chart">this famous 1957 Disney org/strategy chart</a> in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/disneys-taylor-swift-era/">a (very good) Stratechery post</a> this week. I just now added a link to it in the footnote regarding company org charts in my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/disney_and_apple_sitting_in_a_tree">Disney/Apple piece</a> from yesterday, but it feels worth a post of its own.</p><p> At the center of the Disney business in the 1957 chart were theatrical films. Everything else — TV, music, magazines and comics, and the then-new Disneyland — funneled into and revolved around the theatrical films.</p><p> Lesser known is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthunterross/7973803710/in/pool-978039@N25/">this 1967 revision</a> . Or at least lesser known to me — I hadn&#39;t seen it before today. Walt Disney died in 1966, so this chart reflects the company as he left it. The differences from the 1957 chart that strike me:</p><ul><li><p> Disneyland moved closer to the core of the company, nearly rivaling the motion picture studio in centrality.</p></li><li><p> “Disney World Florida” is tucked down in the corner, but wouldn&#39;t open until October 1971. The trend is obvious: theme parks (including, eventually, <a href="https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/">floating ones</a> <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-17">1</a></sup> ) would replace movies as the core of the company.</p></li><li><p> Unfamiliar to me was a box named “Mineral King”, illustrated with a skiing Goofy. <a href="https://yesterland.com/mineralking.html">Turns out this was to be a ski resort in Sequoia National Forest</a> in California, with land rights granted by the National Forest Service in 1965. Embroiled in lawsuits from the no-fun Sierra Club for a decade, Disney abandoned the project in 1976.</p></li><li><p> “Comic strips” are listed separately from “publications” on both charts. I&#39;m old enough to remember reading the newspaper comics page daily, but not old enough to remember when Mickey and pals were on them. Pre-TV, a daily newspaper comic strip filled the role that social media does today: a free way to engage everyone with small nuggets of entertainment. <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-17"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-17">2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p> Lastly, WED Enterprises — aka Imagineering — is a big part of the 1967 chart, but wasn&#39;t even listed on the 1957 one. [ <strong>Update:</strong> WED was a private company owned by Walt, personally, until 1965, which explains its omission from the 1957 chart for the Disney company.] Disney was, and should remain, a serious engineering company. In 1967, WED engineers were creating everything from theme park animatronics to transportation systems. Sounds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">familiar</a> .

<p>Kim Masters and Alex Weprin, writing for The Hollywood Reporter under the headline “ <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-apple-deal-1235559416/">A Disney Sale to Apple? Don&#39;t Count It Out This Time</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> There clearly is no buyer like Apple, which is sitting on $62 billion in cash and cash equivalents and has a $2.8 trillion market cap. And while it may be very true that Apple doesn&#39;t want to buy <em>a</em> studio, maybe it would want to buy <em>this</em> studio — the one that, despite the challenges of the moment, has a vault full of priceless IP and remains the most valuable brand in entertainment.</p><p> And there has been a long-standing “special relationship” between Disney and Apple: Steve Jobs served on Disney&#39;s board of directors from 2006 until his death in 2011. Iger joined Apple&#39;s board shortly after Jobs died. He resigned from that position Sept. 10, 2019, the same day Apple officially announced that it was getting into the content business through its Apple TV+ service.</p></blockquote><p> I do not think Apple has any interest in buying Disney. Apple frequently acquires small companies — on average, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56178792">about once per month</a> . Many of these acquisitions are so quiet they get no press coverage whatsoever, which is how Apple likes it. When acquisitions <em>are</em> noted, the company <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q="Apple+buys+smaller+technology+companies+from+time+to+time,+and+we+generally+do+not+discuss+our+purpose+or+plans"&amp;ia=web">has a boilerplate response</a> : “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” They&#39;d need a longer statement if they bought Disney.</p><p> Beats, of course, was the exception to the rule. <a href="#fn3-2023-08-16">At $3 billion in 2014</a> , it remains, by far, Apple&#39;s largest-ever acquisition. Disney&#39;s current market cap is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=DIS+market+cap+on+15+august+2023">$158 billion</a> . I&#39;m in no way arguing that Apple couldn&#39;t afford to buy Disney, even at a generous markup, but rather that enormous industry-shuffling acquisitions like that aren&#39;t what Apple does, nor, in my opinion, should do. Apple has a very distinct company culture and focus. PA Semi, which Apple acquired with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/04/23/pa-semi">relatively little fanfare</a> for a mere $278 million in 2008, is Apple&#39;s style of acquisition. Apple is not comprised of divisional fiefdoms like Microsoft, <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-16">1</a></sup> which is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/microsoft-activision-agree-to-extend-deal-deadline-to-oct-18.html">buying Activision for $69 billion</a> , or Amazon, which bought its way into the grocery store market by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/how-whole-foods-has-changed-in-the-five-years-since-amazon-took-over.html">acquiring Whole Foods for $14 billion</a> . Manu Cornet&#39;s <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/organizational-charts">classic 2011 comic strip illustrating tech company org charts</a> remains apt, and is only funny because it&#39;s accurate. <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-16">2</a></sup></p><p> Disney, too, has a very distinct company culture and focus. And there are some obvious areas where Disney&#39;s and Apple&#39;s cultures overlap: they are both family-friendly iconic brands with outsized cultural influence, with reputations for industry-leading design and engineering. What each company does, they strive to do <em>best</em> . And because they prioritize quality over all else, both companies have built enormous devoted customer bases that are really more like <em>fan</em> bases. The reason the notion of an Apple-Disney acquisition has any legs at all is that it&#39;s not crazy. If Apple <em>were</em> to buy a major entertainment/media company, they&#39;d probably want Disney. Why drink Veuve Clicquot when you can afford Dom Perignon? If you&#39;re going to buy, buy the best. <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-16">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnr4-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn4-2023-08-16">4</a></sup></p><p> And if Disney were to look for a buyer, I can&#39;t think of a single big-enough-to-afford-it company other than Apple that they would <em>want</em> to sell to. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-disney-stock-brand-snow-white-mickey-2022-2">Berkshire Hathaway</a> is the only other big-enough company I can think of that might be trusted to let Disney be Disney. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/">Berkshire today holds no Disney stock at all</a> , which strongly suggests Warren Buffett would have no interest in buying the whole company at its current price. Berkshire does, though, own 6 percent of Apple&#39;s stock, <sup id="fnr5-2023-08-16"><a href="#fn5-2023-08-16">5</a></sup> so they would, by proxy, own a sizable stake in Disney if ... Apple bought Disney.</p><p> I just don&#39;t think Apple has any such interest or appetite. Nor do I think Disney envisions its own future as anything but the independent company it has been ever since Walt and Roy Disney founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio 100 years ago.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-16"><p> Microsoft and Apple, forged in the image of their founders, have long been opposites in so many regards. Their contrasting strategies regarding large acquisitions exemplify that. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft">Microsoft has made eight acquisitions larger than Apple&#39;s $3 billion purchase of Beats</a> (all prices in billions): Activision Blizzard ($69), LinkedIn ($26), Nuance ($20), Skype ($8.5), ZeniMax ($8.1), GitHub ($7.5), Nokia ($7.2), and aQuantive ($6.3). I&#39;d even toss in Minecraft-maker Mojang at $2.5 billion, which is just under the price Apple paid for Beats. Would Microsoft consider buying Disney? I think they might, especially if Disney&#39;s stock dips further. (Let&#39;s put aside the regulatory hurdles such a deal would obviously face — Microsoft seems to relish such battles.) Microsoft is big in gaming, of course, but stands alone amongst Apple, Amazon, and Google with no foothold in streaming video. Would Disney consider selling itself to Microsoft? I sure hope not. <a href="#fnr1-2023-08-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2023-08-16"><p> Although I think that if redrawn today, Meta/Facebook&#39;s cartoon org chart ought to look more like a cross between Apple&#39;s and Amazon&#39;s. The buck stops with Zuck. And while we know the bullseye in the 2011 Apple chart was Steve Jobs, Apple&#39;s organization today is not <em>that</em> much more hierarchical than it was then. I&#39;d draw it more like a small council in the center, rather than a singular figure. But it&#39;s still spoke-and-hub. Also worth noting: <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/07/14/disney-business-strategy-chart-1957/">Walt Disney&#39;s 1957 business strategy chart</a> , and <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/walt-disney-productions-organizational-synergy-diagram-1967-69533.html">a 1967 follow-up</a> .

Practically speaking the timing would seemingly have made it impossible. Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion January 2006, a full year before the iPhone was announced. Apple was thriving by that time — the Mac had completed its software transition from classic Mac OS to Mac OS X, and was beginning its hardware transition from PowerPC to Intel; the iPod was a cultural sensation and smash hit; and the company&#39;s foray into its own retail stores was proving to be an, <em>err</em> , genius decision. But Apple circa 2006 was not <em>acquire another company for $7.4 billion</em> thriving. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/10/11Apple-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Results/">In October 2005 Apple announced its then-best-ever financial year</a> : $14 billion in revenue, $1.3 billion in profit. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/10/amid-tech-industry-fears-apple-reports-record-q4-results/">Apple&#39;s fiscal 2022</a> , for comparison: $316 billion in revenue, and a smooth $100 billion in profit. Apple today generates more profit every 5 days than it did in the entire year of 2006. Apple&#39;s market cap in January 2006: $60 billion. Today: $3,000 billion.</p><p> Not to mention that Apple had no strategic reason to acquire Pixar in 2006. Apple TV+ didn&#39;t launch until 2019. The iTunes Store didn&#39;t even start renting movies <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/188954/itunesrent.html">until 2008</a> . Jobs selling Pixar (in which he owned over $1 billion in stock at the price it sold to Disney) to Apple would have looked fishy, to say the least. Also not to mention that Disney held unique leverage over Pixar&#39;s ability to shop itself to other potential suitors — Disney didn&#39;t own Pixar, but they did own the intellectual property for all of the movies Pixar had made to date: <em>Toy Story</em> , <em>A Bug&#39;s Life</em> , <em>Monsters Inc.</em> , <em>Finding Nemo</em> , <em>The Incredibles</em> , and the then-upcoming <em>Cars</em> , <em>Ratatouille</em> , <em>WALL-E</em> , and <em>Up</em> . Buying Pixar without acquiring those rights would have been like, well, buying Disney today without acquiring Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Star Wars, and Marvel.</p><p> But if we wave all that inconvenient historical timing away, in the abstract it&#39;s easy today to imagine Pixar as a film studio ( <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/pixar-adobe-apple-autodesk-and-nvidia-form-alliance-for-openusd/">and engineering</a> ) subsidiary of Apple. It would be both a perfect cultural and strategic fit. <a href="#fnr4-2023-08-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li><li id="fn5-2023-08-16"><p> I was well aware that Berkshire Hathaway owns a 6 percent stake in Apple, but until I looked at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/">this list of its holdings</a> , I had no idea that Berkshire&#39;s Apple holdings account for 46 percent of its entire portfolio.

<p>Clark Neily, writing for Cato:</p><blockquote><p> America has seen its fair share of lying politicians, but Donald Trump is in a class of his own. He appears to view literally any interaction with another human being as an opportunity to be exploited and a game to be won. In Trump&#39;s world, rules are for chumps, norms are for losers, and the truth is whatever you can get another person to believe — nothing more. And of course, history makes clear that this approach has been quite effective at advancing Trump&#39;s interests in certain settings — preening on the set of a game show, for example, or spinning up a fawning, frothing crowd at a campaign event.</p><p> But not only will those antics not work in a courtroom, they will backfire. Given the nature of the allegations against him, Trump will <em>have</em> to take the stand even though he has a right not to, and given <em>his</em> nature, he will lie to the jury just like he has lied to everyone else his entire life.</p></blockquote><p> Nothing new in that description, of course, but as Josh Marshall notes, it&#39;s a “tight and concise run-through”.<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/how-not-to-fall-for-trumps-what-he-believes-nonsense">Marshall adds</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I note this because Trump&#39;s press conference seems to presage a new and insipid public debate about what Donald Trump <em>really</em> believes. We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t note that it&#39;s actually irrelevant what Trump believes. Believing the bank owes you money isn&#39;t a defense for robbing the bank. But that&#39;s not the core point. Trump&#39;s current antics are like a liar&#39;s version of a fake insanity defense in which the defendant makes a spectacle of bizarre behavior to prove his case. Surely, we&#39;re supposed be thinking, or rather doubting, he wouldn&#39;t go back to the well, provide yet more evidence for the prosecution, unless he somehow truly believe this stuff.</p><p> But Trump doesn&#39;t think of truth or lies the way you or I do. Most imperfect people, which is to say all of us, exist in a tension between what we believe is true and what is good for or pleasing to us. If we have strong character we hew closely to the former, both in what we say to others and what we say to ourselves. The key to understanding Trump is that it&#39;s not that he hews toward the latter. It&#39;s that the tension doesn&#39;t exist. What he says is simply what works for him.</p></blockquote><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Trump’s Toast, Folks’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/trumps-toast">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> 25th Anniversary of the iMac </title><link href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-jobs-unveils-imac-169734" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v02" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40178</id><published> 2023-08-16T20:48:42Z</published><updated> 2023-08-20T01:00:41Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Steven Levy, in a 1998 profile for Newsweek that holds up startlingly well:</p><blockquote><p> “Look at that!” says Steve Jobs as he pulls his Mercedes into a parking space. He&#39;s pointing at a new Volkswagen Beetle, and as soon as he parks, he dashes over, circling the shiny black Bug, taking the measure of a well-publicized update of once great product design. “They got it right,” he concludes.</p><p> Last Wednesday Jobs himself received a more thunderous thumbs-up at the announcement of Apple Computer&#39;s successor to its own hall-of-fame classic, the original Macintosh: a machine designed for consumers dubbed the iMac (only Apple would dare to lowercase the “I” in Internet). The crowd in Cupertino, Calif.&#39;s Flint Center — site of the historic Mac launch 14 years ago — largely consisted of Apple employees. But due to an industrial-strength cone of silence shrouding the new product, few had been aware of its existence. So after a morale-boosting slide show documenting the company&#39;s new profits, and a demonstration of the speed of its sleek new laptops, the crowd went bonkers when interim CEO Jobs, in a rare appearance in a business suit, literally unveiled a piece of hardware that blends sci-fi shimmer with the kitsch whimsy of a cocktail umbrella. As distinctively curvy as the Beetle, dressed in retro-geeky, translucent plastic, the iMac (due to ship in August) is not only the coolest-looking computer introduced in years, but a chest-thumping statement that Silicon Valley&#39;s original dream company is no longer somnambulant.</p></blockquote><p> That first iMac shipped 25 years ago this week. No amount of praise heaped upon it is sufficient. It reestablished the Mac platform, and paved the way for <em>everything</em> the entire company has since accomplished. (The Macintosh platform was younger then (14) than the iPhone is today (16), an observation that I find rather upsetting.)</p><p> This line from Larry Ellison, then an Apple board member, at the invitation of Jobs, defines Apple as much as it does Jobs personally:</p><blockquote><p> Yes, his demeanor can be alarmingly frank — he can sometimes glance at an employee&#39;s hard-won accomplishment and sneer, “This is a &#39;D&#39;.” But critics who focus on the brutality of his assessments miss the point: Jobs&#39;s verbal boot camp can catalyze previously untapped greatness. “There&#39;s too much emphasis on this style issue,” says Larry Ellison. “Steve is obsessed with quality, and that can make him uncompromising, but he gets results.”</p></blockquote><p> As Jobs himself would <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/20/design-is-how-it-works">soon say</a> , “Design is how it works.” The original iMac exemplifies that. Yes, everyone noticed first what it <em>looked</em> like. But it was an insanely great computer.</p><p> <strong>See Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808948/imac-twenty-five-visual-history-apple-design-models">Umar Shakir&#39;s copiously illustrated retrospective for The Verge of every major iMac design</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘25th Anniversary of the iMac’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Pinned&#39; Links in Apple Messages </title><link href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-15/tips/how-to-pin-articles-and-images-sent-over-messages-in-ios-15-and-ipados-15" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v00" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/pinned-links-in-messages" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40176</id><published> 2023-08-16T19:15:00Z</published><updated> 2023-08-17T00:35:52Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Last week I noticed a feature for the first time: the contextual menu for a link or image sent in Messages has a “Pin” command. This is a different form of pinning than pinning an entire thread — it&#39;s just for individual <em>messages</em> , and only messages that are links <s>or images</s> . I couldn&#39;t figure out what this did until I found this write-up at AppleInsider, which explains the point. When you pin a link, you can refer back to it in the profile details for the contact(s) in that thread. That&#39;s the popover you get by:</p><ul><li> Tapping the user avatar in the center of the top navigation bar on iOS.</li><li> Clicking the “i”-in-circle Info button on MacOS.</li></ul><p> Scroll down in that popover and there&#39;s a section for pins, right above the section showing all photos in the conversation.</p><p> Kind of a weirdly obscure feature. I can see using it, maybe, now that I know it&#39;s there. But I never would have guessed it was there, and couldn&#39;t even figure out what “Pin” meant in this context until I searched the web for an answer.</p><p> <strong>Update 1:</strong> The AppleInsider article I&#39;m linking to claims the feature works for images in addition to links, and I originally just took them at their word for that, but it turns out it only works for links. We regret the error. But it just further confirms how unintuitive the feature is.</p><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> These pinned links also show up in Safari, in Safari&#39;s “Shared With You” list. In iOS Safari, you get to “Shared With You” by tapping in the URL location field — they appear under your Favorites. On the Mac, “Shared With You” is in Safari&#39;s sidebar, at the bottom, under your tab groups. Pinned links, as you&#39;d guess, stay at the top of the “Shared With You” list. But you can&#39;t unpin them in Safari on either iOS or MacOS, nor you can you pin other items in Shared With You from within Safari. And even within Messages, the only place where you can unpin a link is in its original location within the message thread. So if you pin a link in a busy thread, and want to unpin it after some time as passed, you need to scroll all the way back to when it originally appeared. You can&#39;t unpin links from the contact popover where they&#39;re listed. And if you “delete” a pinned link in the contact popover in Messages, <em>it deletes the original message</em> , not merely removes its pin. The more I figure out about this feature, the more half-baked it seems.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Pinned’ Links in Apple Messages’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/pinned-links-in-messages">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Dahlia Lithwick: &#39;Trump&#39;s Last Two Indictments Complement Each Other Perfectly&#39; </title><link href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/trump-indictments-jack-smith-fani-willis-themes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v01" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/lithwick-trump-two-indictments" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40177</id><published> 2023-08-16T19:12:11Z</published><updated> 2023-08-16T19:12:11Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Dahlia Lithwick, writing for Slate:</p><blockquote><p> The two most recent indictments filed against Donald J. Trump are mirror images in many ways. Jack Smith&#39;s federal document <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/trump-indictment-jack-smith-charges.html">filed in Washington</a> was spare almost to the point of being an inky line drawing, whereas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/15/us/politics/trump-georgia-indictment-annotated.html">Fani Willis&#39; Georgia filing</a> is rich and detailed and pointillist. Smith targeted one defendant only, whereas Willis went after 19 defendants on 41 counts. Smith mentions a handful of co-conspirators; Willis notes 30 unindicted co-conspirators. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/opinion/trump-indictment-georgia-fani-willis.html?searchResultPosition=1">Norm Eisen and Amy Lee Copeland</a> point out, Smith&#39;s case will likely be blacked out for television and audio audiences, whereas Willis&#39; suit will most likely become must-see TV for weeks on end. Jennifer Rubin argues that the DC trial <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/15/fani-willis-trump-indictment-georgia/">will happen quickly</a> , while the Georgia case may face months of wrangling, flipping, bargaining with conspirators, and lengthy pretrial shenanigans. <a href="https://clairepotter.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share">Claire Potter points out</a> that Willis can seize Trump&#39;s assets under Georgia&#39;s RICO law.

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/special-counsel-twitter-messages-trump/index.html">Katelyn Polantz, reporting for CNN</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The special counsel&#39;s investigation into Donald Trump and the aftermath of the 2020 election sought the former president&#39;s Twitter direct messages, of which there were many, federal prosecutors and lawyers for Twitter revealed in newly unsealed transcripts from February court hearings about the search warrant. [...]</p><p> A lawyer representing Twitter, now called “X,” similarly confirmed in court that Trump&#39;s account had several private messages between users on the platform. “X” was able to find both the sent direct messages and deleted messages for prosecutors, according to the transcripts.</p><p> “We were able to determine that there was some volume in that for this account. There are confidential communications,” a lawyer for Twitter said about @realDonaldTrump&#39;s direct messages.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/us/politics/trump-twitter-direct-messages-warrant.html">Alan Feuer and Maggie Haberman, reporting for The New York Times</a> :</p><blockquote><p> While it remained unclear what sorts of information the messages contained and who exactly may have written them, it was a revelation that there were private messages associated with the Twitter account of Mr. Trump, who has famously been cautious about using written forms of communications in his dealings with aides and allies.</p><p> The papers included transcripts of hearings in Federal District Court in Washington in February during which Judge Beryl A. Howell asserted that Mr. Smith&#39;s office had sought Mr. Trump&#39;s direct messages — or DMs — from Twitter as part of a search warrant it executed on the account in January.</p><p> In one of the transcripts, a lawyer for Twitter, answering questions from Judge Howell, confirmed that the company had turned over to the special counsel&#39;s office “all direct messages, the DMs” from Mr. Trump&#39;s Twitter account, including those sent, received and “stored in draft form.”</p><p> The lawyer for Twitter told Judge Howell that the company had found both “deleted” and “nondeleted” direct messages associated with Mr. Trump&#39;s account.</p></blockquote><p> I am not at all surprised that “deleted” DMs are not in fact deleted, but rather hidden. I am slightly surprised that Trump — famously averse not just to using email and text messages, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/trump-texting.html">even to his own lawyers taking written notes in meetings</a> , so as not to leave a chain of evidence for his lifelong criminal activity — would use, of all things, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">infamously unencrypted</a> direct messaging feature on Twitter.

But the newly unsealed transcripts of the proceedings in her courtroom show that the fine was the least of the punishment. Howell lit into Twitter for taking “extraordinary” and apparently unprecedented steps to give Trump advance notice about the search warrant — despite prosecutors&#39; warnings, backed by unspecified evidence, that notifying Trump could cause grave damage to their investigation.</p><p> “Is this to make Donald Trump feel like he is a particularly welcomed new renewed user of Twitter?” Howell asked.</p><p> “Twitter has no interest other than litigation its constitutional rights,” replied attorney George Varghese of WilmerHale, the firm Twitter deploys for much of its litigation.</p><p> But Howell returned to the theme repeatedly during the proceedings, wondering why the company was taking “momentous” steps to protect Trump that it had never taken for other users. In the hearing on Feb. 7, 2023, Howell referenced Musk, asking: “Is it because the new CEO wants to cozy up with the former president?”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/23sc31%20Attachment%20A%20-%20Documents%20unsealed%20with%20redactions.pdf">The unsealed court filing (PDF) is here</a> , for your reading enjoyment.

<p>Jeremy B. Merrill and Drew Harwell, reporting for The Washington Post:</p><blockquote><p> The company formerly known as Twitter has begun slowing the speed with which users can access links to the New York Times, Facebook and other news organizations and online competitors, a move that appears targeted at companies that have drawn the ire of owner Elon Musk. [...] The delayed websites included X&#39;s online rivals Facebook, Instagram, Bluesky and Substack, as well as the Reuters wire service and the Times. All of them have previously been singled out by Musk for ridicule or attack.</p><p> The delay affects the t.co domain, a link-shortening service that X uses to process every link posted to the website. Traffic is routed through the middleman service, allowing X to track — and in this case throttle — activity to the target website, potentially taking away traffic and ad revenue from businesses Musk personally dislikes.</p><p> The Post&#39;s analysis found that links to most other sites were unaffected — including those to The Washington Post, Fox News and social media services such as Mastodon and YouTube — with the shortened links being routed to their final destination in a second or less. A user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060">first flagged</a> the delays early Tuesday on the technology discussion forum Hacker News.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060">The Hacker News thread</a> has the sort of nerdery you&#39;d expect, including the fact that you won&#39;t see the delay when using <code>curl</code> with its default user-agent string, because <code>curl</code> is special-cased by t.co.</p><p> Hanlon&#39;s Razor — “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity” — is a remarkably accurate rule of thumb. But in the case of Twitter/X, it&#39;s not helpful: the stupidity behind the company&#39;s poorly run services is matched by the spitefulness of its owner. Purposeful spite and inadvertent bug strike me as equally likely here, and the list of domain that suffer this delay really does look like Musk&#39;s shitlist. But regardless of the cause, the effect is undeniably bad for users: click or tap a link to these popular sites from Twitter, and it takes about 5 seconds for the URL to resolve.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Hanlon’s Razor Meets Its Match: Twitter/X’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/hanlons-x">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump&#39;s Unsent Draft Tweets </title><link href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-drafted-tweet-calling-supporters-march-us-capitol-jan-6-2022-7" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzw" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/trump-unsent-draft-tweets" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40172</id><published> 2023-08-15T18:40:58Z</published><updated> 2023-08-16T02:50:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>From a Business Insider report last July:</p><blockquote><p> The House committee investigating the Capitol riot on Tuesday revealed a draft tweet in which President Donald Trump called on his supporters to go to the US Capitol after his speech on January 6, 2021.</p><p> “I will be making a Big Speech at 10AM on January 6th at the Ellipse (South of the White House). Please arrive early, massive crowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the Steal!!” Trump wrote in the draft tweet, which is undated.</p><p> Trump never sent the tweet, but its existence, along with other messages exchanged between rally organizers, offer proof that the march to the Capitol was premeditated, the January 6 committee said.</p><p> Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida presented the evidence during Tuesday&#39;s hearing, and said: “The evidence confirms that this was not a spontaneous call to action, but rather it was a deliberate strategy decided upon in advance by the president.”</p></blockquote><p> Unsent draft tweets seem among the most likely targets <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/trump_dms">of the January 6 special counsel subpoena</a> — and it&#39;s possible that Twitter saves everything each user has ever typed in the tweet-editing field.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Trump’s Unsent Draft Tweets’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/15/trump-unsent-draft-tweets">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/trump_dms" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/uzn" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023://1.40163</id><published> 2023-08-10T21:17:57Z</published><updated> 2023-08-16T03:18:01Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> It seems unlikely on the surface that someone who doesn&#39;t use email or text messaging would use DMs, but if the special counsel was not looking for DMs, I&#39;m not even sure what the warrant *could* have been after. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Rachel Weiner, reporting for The Washington Post yesterday, “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/09/twitter-fine-jan-6-trump/">Twitter Was Fined $350,000 for Failing to Turn Over Trump&#39;s Data</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> The social media company Twitter was forced to hand over records from former president Donald Trump&#39;s account to the special counsel investigating the events leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and pay sanctions for failing to do so more quickly, as disclosed in an appellate court ruling unsealed Wednesday. [...]</p><p> Attorneys for Twitter did not oppose the search warrant but argued that a gag order preventing the company from alerting Trump to the search violated the First Amendment. The company argued that it should not have to hand over the records until that issue was resolved. Howell sided with the government, finding Twitter in contempt Feb. 7 for failing to comply with the search warrant. She gave Twitter until 5 pm to produce the records, with sanctions of $50,000 per day, to double every day that Twitter did not comply. Twitter produced the records three days later.</p></blockquote><p> The Post story focuses on Twitter&#39;s stonewalling — which, given that it took place this year, I presume was driven by Elon Musk. But I&#39;m keenly interested in what the search warrant was after. It wasn&#39;t Trump&#39;s tweets, which are public. So the obvious conclusion: his direct messages. Trump, famously, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/politics/donald-trump-computers-internet-email/index.html">does not use email</a> and, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/trump-texting.html">until this year</a> , apparently didn&#39;t use text messaging either. But did he send or receive DMs on Twitter? And was he stupid enough to put anything incriminating in them? Is he about to be hoisted with Twitter&#39;s unencrypted petard?</p><p> It seems unlikely on the surface that someone who doesn&#39;t use email or text messaging would use DMs, but if the special counsel was not looking for DMs, I&#39;m not even sure what the warrant <em>could</em> have been after. There just isn&#39;t much else associated with a Twitter account that isn&#39;t public. The least satisfying answer could be that the special counsel issued the warrant <em>just in case</em> Trump was a DM user, but he wasn&#39;t, and there was nothing (or nothing relevant) there. But the special counsel convinced the court that Trump&#39;s Twitter account information contained evidence of criminality. <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513/gov.uscourts.cadc.39513.1208541751.0.pdf">From the unsealed appellate court ruling</a> :</p><blockquote><p> On January 17, 2023, the government applied for, and obtained, a search warrant that directed Twitter to produce data and records related to the “@realDonaldTrump” Twitter account. At the same time, the government applied for, and obtained, a nondisclosure order, which prohibited Twitter from disclosing the existence or contents of the search warrant to any person. Based on <em>ex parte</em> affidavits, the district court found probable cause to search the Twitter account for evidence of criminal offenses. Moreover, the district court found that there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that disclosing the warrant to former President Trump “would seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation” by giving him “an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of behavior, [or] notify confederates.” The warrant required Twitter to turn over all requested information by January 27, 2023. The nondisclosure order was to remain in effect for 180 days after its issuance.</p></blockquote><p> That doesn&#39;t sound like a fishing expedition.</p><p> Twitter DMs, infamously, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages">are not encrypted</a> . With E2EE messaging platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp, messages are not magically protected from search warrants — but such messages can only be produced from the participants&#39; own devices or, depending on the platform, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/reuters_report_on_apple_dropping_plan_for_encrypted_icloud_backups">from backups of those devices</a> . But with non-encrypted Twitter DMs, the messages are just sitting there on Twitter&#39;s servers. We also know, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/twitter-bug-deleted-tweets">from this story just a few months ago</a> , that “deleted” tweets were just hidden, not actually deleted — and a bug resulted in deleted tweets resurfacing. Was that (or is it still) true for “deleted” direct messages as well? I think it&#39;s quite likely that every single DM ever sent on Twitter is still around.</p><p> Speaking of Twitter bugs, this bit from the unsealed court ruling made me laugh:</p><blockquote><p> The government faced difficulties when it first attempted to serve Twitter with the warrant and nondisclosure order. On January 17, 2023, the government tried to submit the papers through Twitter&#39;s website for legal requests, only to find out that the website was inoperative. Two days later, on January 19, 2023, the government successfully served Twitter through that website.</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Was Trump Using Twitter Direct Messages?
