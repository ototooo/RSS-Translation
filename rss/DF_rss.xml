<p>在我在这个球拍中的二十年中，我从来没有对自己错过一个故事比我<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">在周五宣布的宣布</a>的苹果智能的“更个性化的Siri”功能（原定出现在现在到现在的WWDC之间）的愤怒，这将被推迟到“来年”。</p><p>我应该检查头。</p><p>这一宣布令人惊讶，当然使我感到惊讶，但这从一开始就到了。我本来应该指出去年从WWDC开始的危险信号，我很尴尬，很抱歉，我从一开始就没有看到我应该很清楚的东西。</p><p>我错过了这是双重的。首先，苹果公司始终如一地运送预先宣布的产品和功能，让我感到自满。他们在这方面的记录并不完美，但是例外往往围绕边缘。 （没有人特别渴望苹果制作多个设备的电感充电垫，因此<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features#fn1-2025-03-07">，当空气动力被证明是一个完整的破产时，</a>它从来没有引起过多争议。对于Apple来说，将其AI功能贴上这样的伞术语是一个好主意，类似于一堆不同的功能，这些功能如何使不同的Apple设备互操作在“<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">连续性</a>”雨伞下。但是从技术上讲，没有这样的事情是“连续性”。并不是说Apple内部有一个名为Continuity.xcodeproj的Xcode项目，并且所有支持从Airdrop到Sidecar再到iPhone镜像再到剪贴板共享的代码都在代码的同一框架中实现。这是一个营销术语，但有用的术语 - 它有助于苹果解释这些功能，并帮助用户理解它们。</p><p> “苹果情报”也是如此。它不作为单一事物或项目存在。这是一个营销术语，用于集合功能，应用程序和服务。将其全部置于一个明显的，易于记住的（ <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/design/print-design-publishing/apples-new-billboard-ads-are-um-not-great">易于提升</a>）的名称之下，使用户更容易理解苹果正在启动一项新计划。这也使苹果更容易说：“<em>这些设备都有资格获得所有这些功能，而其他设备（较旧的设备，便宜的设备）都无法获得。</em>透明</p><p>假设苹果将明年悄悄放弃愚蠢的图像游乐场应用程序。它只是从iOS 19和MacOS 16中消失了。这只是苹果消除了一个愚蠢的应用程序，几乎没有人使用或不应该使用。那不是“苹果情报”的挫折或回滚。我实际上会说，斧头图像游乐场将改善苹果智能。它的存在大大降低了对整个事情的好处的期望。 <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-12">1</a></sup></p><p>我的意思是，从WWDC主题演讲中，我很清楚，苹果智能的某些特征和方面比其他人更雄心勃勃。有些是彻头彻尾的琐事。其他人则建议重新定义我们将如何从事工作并与最常用的设备进行互动。那很明显。但是，我并没有以某种方式专注于它。苹果本身强烈暗示，Apple Intelligence的各种功能并非同时发货。他们没有拼出的内容，但是任何人都可以直觉，那就是更琐碎的功能将首先发货，而后来的功能更雄心勃勃。那是我应该显而易见的危险信号的地方。</p><p>在广泛的笔触中，任何公司宣布的功能有四个“诚实”或“现实”的阶段：</p><ol><li><p>该公司自己的产品代表将在媒体面前演示的特色。比舞台上的演示更小，更多的个人演示更可信。但是，在充满观察者的礼堂中，演示失败的赌注更高。</p></li><li><p>该公司将允许媒体成员（或其他受邀外部观察员和专家）在公司的监督和指导下在有限的时间内尝试自己。 Vision Pro Demos在WWDC 2023上就是这样。我们中的一群人必须使用预发行硬件和过程中的软件30分钟。这并不是自由放松的“做任何您想做的事”，而是一次导游。但是我们实际上是使用该产品的人。 Apple允许动手演示<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/186251/ihnatkoiphone.html">在2007年在MacWorld Expo上使用原型原型iPhone</a>来提供一些媒体（不是我） - 一些“应用程序”只是屏幕截图，但大多数iPhone实际上都可以使用。</p></li><li><p>为开发人员，发烧友和媒体以自己的设备使用的功能，而无需限制或监督，将发布为开发人员，发烧友和媒体。</p></li><li><p>实际上运送给普通用户的功能以及常规用户可以出去购买的硬件。</p></li></ol><p>截至今天 -  2025年3月 - <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/26/this-is-every-apple-intelligence-feature-thats-available-now/">实际发货的</a>苹果智能中的每项功能都位于WWDC的1级。主题演讲之后，媒体中的数十名被邀请参加一系列小组简报，我们必须观看Apple Reps演示功能，例如编写工具，照片清理，Genmoji等。我们必须在XCode中查看预测代码完成。截至今天，他们能够在6月以某种功能状态显示出来。</p><p>例如，有一个演示，涉及iPad上的电子邮件草稿，而Apple Rep使用了写作工具使其“更友好”。我只参加了媒体的另外四个或五个成员，看着这一点。像往常一样，我们鼓励我们打扰问题。知道LLM是非确定性的，我问，当苹果代表对每个连续的媒体成员进行相同的演示时，“更友好”的结果每次都完全相同。他笑着说不，虽然每次结果都非常相似，但他希望它们继续保持（因此笑），但同一演示的不同跑步之间存在微妙的差异。我记得，他甚至使用撤消来返回原始消息文本，调用写作工具以使其再次“更友好”，我们可以看到一些单词的选择略有不同。这回答了我明确的问题，也回答了我的隐式问题：写作工具会产生非确定性的结果，更重要的是，我们所观察的实际上是现场演示。</p><p>我们没有自己尝试任何Apple Intelligence功能。没有苹果智能“动手”。但是我们确实看到了Apple Folks现场演示的一堆功能。在我上述现实层次结构中，它们都处于1级。</p><p>但是我们没有看到Apple Intelligence的<em>各个</em>方面都被演示了。没有一个“更具个性化的Siri”功能，Apple <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">在其自己的陈述中宣布推迟的声明中</a>，被描述为“对您的个人上下文有更多的认识，以及在应用程序内部和跨应用程序中为您采取行动的能力”。这些功能包括三个主要内容：</p><ul><li> “个人上下文”  - 从“语义索引”中了解有关您的详细信息和信息，这是根据您的电子邮件，消息，文件，联系人等的内容构建的。从理论上讲，最终，您希望与Siri共享的设备上的所有信息都将在此语义索引中。如果您可以在设备上查找它，Siri将能够在您的设备上查找它。</li><li> “屏幕上的意识”  - 使Siri了解屏幕上显示的内容。<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">苹果自己的示例用法</a>：“如果朋友向您发短信给您新的地址，您可以说&#39;将此地址添加到他们的联系卡中&#39;，而Siri会照顾好它。”</li><li><p> “应用程序内动作”  - 通过应用程序意见框架，使Siri能够在应用程序中和跨应用程序中的老式方式（<em>您</em>自己）中进行操作。同样，这是苹果自己的示例用法：</p><blockquote><p>您可以提出一个请求，例如“将我起草给April和Lilly的电子邮件发送”，Siri知道您要引用的电子邮件以及它在哪个应用程序。以及Siri可以在应用程序上采取操作，因此，在您要求Siri来为您增强照片以通过说“制作这张照片流行”来增强照片后，您可以要求Siri在注释应用程序中放入注释应用程序中，而无需举起手指。</p></blockquote></li></ul><p>没有<em>任何</em>证明。这些功能在我的层次结构上都处于0级。该级别称为蒸气软件。它们是苹果公司<em>所说</em>的特征，他们<em>声称</em>这将在明年发货，并且在签名“ Siri，我妈妈的飞行降落何时降落”中，他们对此非常<em>有效</em>？ WWDC主题演讲本身的段，<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=4934">从1H：22m标记开始</a>。苹果要么不愿意或无法在6月演示这些功能，即使Apple产品营销代表使用准备好的设备从准备好的脚本中执行演示。</p><p>这不应该只是引起我脑海中的关注。它应该引起盲目的红色闪光灯和震耳欲聋的克拉克森警报。</p><p>即使是从事一个项目的工程师也永远不知道要完成多长时间。一个观察不完整软件的脚本演示的局外人比工程师所需要的工作要远少得多。但是您可以做出粗暴的判断。这就是我上述现实层次结构发挥作用的地方。即使是局外人也可以判断公共Beta（第3阶段）的感觉如何。苹果将​​允许新闻界玩耍的功能或产品，动手实践（第2阶段）比苹果只愿意表现出自己的功能或产品（第1阶段）。</p><p>但是，苹果不愿意证明的功能或产品是不可知的。它主要是在起作用，并且靠近但不完全证明吗？这只是有点工作吗？部分功能虽然远非完整？功能齐全但容易崩溃 - 或者在AI的情况下，容易出现幻觉和虚假？还是完全小说，这只是一个想法？</p><p>苹果在WWDC即将到来的“个性化Siri”方面所展示的<em>不是</em>演示。这是一个概念视频。概念视频是胡说八道，也是公司混乱的迹象，即使不是危机。 1987年<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">，委托未来派的“知识导航器”概念视频的苹果</a>是十年后正在近乎破产的苹果。现代苹果 - 上四分之一世纪的隔壁重新统一苹果 - 没有发布概念视频。他们仅展示实际的工作产品和功能。</p><p>直到去年WWDC。</p><p>去年，我在WWDC上对“苹果智能”的心理框架深深地误导了：<em>其中一些功能比其他功能更远，而苹果公司首先向我们展示了这些功能，它们肯定是明年一年中首次发货的功能。其他功能必须很快就可以证明状态。</em>但是我应该使用的心理框架更像是这样：<em>其中一些功能仅是2024年生成AI的表赌注，但其他功能是雄心勃勃的，具有突破性的，并且鉴于它们可以访问其个人数据，这可能是危险的。苹果只向我们展示了餐桌功能，并且没有展示任何雄心勃勃，开创性，危险的功能。</em></p><p>情况变得更糟。 9月，苹果在Apple Park举行了年度大型活动，以推出iPhone 16阵容。公告中强调了Apple Intelligence功能。聚集了来自世界各地的媒体成员。这是一个新的机会，在WWDC之后三个月后，苹果展示了新的个性化Siri功能，可以展示（甚至更好，都可以动手访问媒体来尝试自己。他们没有。根本没有演示。但是，在主题演讲的情况下，他们确实再次提升了它们。 <sup id="fnr2-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn2-2025-03-12">2</a></sup></p><p>但是，尽管苹果仍然不会亲自展示这些功能，但他们确实委托并播放了电视广告，展示了这些声称的功能，这将它们作为购买新iPhone的理由 - <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature">本周他们从YouTube上提取的广告</a>。</p><p>上周的宣布 - “这将花费我们比我们想象的要更长的时间来交付这些功能，我们预计将在来年推出它们”  - 如果您考虑到这一点，这是另一个机会来展示这些功能的当前状态。他们不仅会向媒体发表声明，还可以邀请媒体的精选成员到苹果公园，或者在纽约的苹果办公室，甚至通过WebEx电话会议远程访问，并在实际设备上展示了这些功能现场的现状。那没有发生。如果这些功能根本没有任何工作状态，那么苹果以外的任何人都没有为它们的存在保证，更不用说其质量了。</p><h2>杜克·努克姆情报局</h2><p>苹果为什么去年在WWDC展示这些个性化的Siri功能，并保证在Apple Intelligence的第一年到来？为此，为什么他们现在声称“预计在来年将它们推出”，如果他们目前仍然不以证明形式存在？ （如果今天<em>确实</em>以证明的形式存在，他们应该<em>证明它们</em>。）</p><p>我不是要在这里钝。很明显，为什么苹果的一些高管可能<em>希望</em>他们去年可以在WWDC上宣传此类功能。自从本世纪以前的突破之类的移动设备（从iPhone开始，随后是Android），社交媒体（Meta）和云计算（Microsoft，Google和Amazon）以来，生成AI是计算机行业中最大的事情。没有人知道它在哪里，但是无论它走到哪里，它都会很大，重要，也许是有利可图的。华尔街当然注意到了。去年WWDC之前，苹果不在比赛中。他们需要讲自己的AI故事。一个涉及餐桌蛋糕AI功能的故事几乎与涉及创新，突破性和雄心勃勃的个人特征的故事一样引人注目。</p><p>但是，尽管明显吸引了苹果，这是最引人注目，最雄心勃勃的AI故事，但唯一必不可少的是讲一个真实的故事。如果事实是苹果在来年与其他业务相比，苹果只有准备发货的功能，那就是他们需要讲的故事。尽可能多地旋转它，但是当您迟到游戏时，它们就是突破。</p><p>这里的惨败不是苹果在AI上迟到。同样，他们并不是他们不得不宣布上周承诺的功能令人尴尬的延迟。这些是问题，而不是fiascos，而问题发生。他们不可避免。领导者证明了自己的勇气并创造了自己的遗产，这不是通过如何处理成功的方式来证明自己的遗产，而是通过如何应对，如何承认，理解，适应和解决问题。惨败的是，苹果公司讲了一个不正确的故事，公司内部的<em>某些</em>人肯定不正确，他们为此设定了一门课程。</p><p>乔布斯流放年份的苹果（1987  -  1997年的Sculley / Spindler / Amelio Apple）推广了各种令人惊叹的概念，这些概念并不比<em>侏罗纪公园</em>的恐龙更真实，并承诺了各种硬件和（尤其是）从未见过一天的硬件。促进您<em>希望</em>有一天船的希望比促进您<em>所知道的</em>实际要运送的东西要容易和令人兴奋。在下次统一后，史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）返回首席执行官时，苹果公司的财务破产距离很近，该公司已经完全破产了信誉。当今的苹果是世界历史上最有利可图，财务上最成功的公司。每个人都注意到如此成功，以及相应的巨大财富积累。较少注意的是，在我看来，更令人印象深刻的成就是，在过去的三十年中，该公司<em>还</em>积累了丰富的信誉。当苹果展示功能时，您可以依靠该功能是真实的。当他们说要在来年发货的东西时，它将在来年发货。在最坏的情况下，也许“年”必须延长至13或14个月。您可以延长真相并保持信誉，但是您无法用胡说八道保持信誉。事实证明，“更个性化的Siri”功能是胡扯。</p><p> Keynote由Keynote的Keynote（按产品按功能划分的产品），年复一年，苹果从一家公司逃脱了您不敢相信的公司，甚至是迄今为止最可靠的技术公司。苹果仍然没有财务破产的风险（实际上仍然是世界上最有利可图的公司）。但是他们的信誉现在已损害。职业将在苹果公司恢复到“如果他们说的话，可以相信它”的水平之前结束，该公司在2024年6月开始就赢得了信誉。</p><p><em>损坏</em>可以说是被动的。它被<em>浪费了</em>。苹果没有发生这种情况。公司内部的决策者做到了。</p><p><em>谁</em>决定这些功能应该在WWDC主题演讲中进行，并承诺他们在来年就会到达，当时他们处于如此未完成的状态，即使在受控的环境中，他们也无法被媒体演示？三个月后，谁决定苹果应该加倍并在电视广告中宣传这些功能，并将其作为iPhone 16阵容的卖点（不仅是任何产品，而且是公司的皇冠上的珠宝以及整个行业的嫉妒）推广，当这些功能仍然保持在如此未完成的或甚至可能是彻头彻尾的状态，以至于他们<em>仍然</em>无法被派往媒体上？不仅不能作为Beta软件发货。不仅可以在动手体验中被媒体成员使用，而且甚至无法证明Apple员工在Apple控制的设备上在Apple控制的环境中工作吗？但是，他们在iPhone 16的广告中做广告，当发现他们不会发货时，在最好的情况下，直到iPhone 17阵容揭幕之后的几个月？</p><p>当广告的整个活动出现时，我和许多其他观察家都因苹果情报中的<em>任何</em>功能尚未发货而分心。苹果宣传<em>所有</em>尚未发货的功能，这是非常不寻常的，可以说是不寻常的。但是其中一个广告完全不像其他广告。其他广告具有接近运输的Apple Intelligence功能。我们知道今天他们已经接近运输，因为它们已经在9月的iOS 18.1 BETA中，要么很快就会出现在iOS 18.2和18.3的开发人员Beta中。现在，今天，他们实际上已经发货了，并且掌握在iPhone 16用户手中。但是“ Siri，我几个月前在咖啡馆格林内尔与我开会的那个家伙的名字是什么？”广告完全是基于苹果仍然从未证明的功能。</p><p>谁说“<em>当然，让我们保证这一点</em>”，然后“<em>当然，让我们做广告</em>”？谁说：“<em>你疯了，这还没有准备好，这不起作用，我们现在不能宣传这一点？</em> ”最重要的是，谁打电话了哪一方？据推测，那个人是蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）。</p><p>即使苹果在WWDC主题演讲中苹果过度宣传（如果不是彻底撒谎），新闻媒体的WWDC的最初收获也被错误地集中在与Openai的合作伙伴关系上。主题演讲中传统的智慧是苹果刚刚宣布了“苹果智能”的内容，但它是由chatgpt驱动的，而实际上，苹果的故事是，苹果的故事是，他们（苹果）建立了一个称为Apple Intellighent的整个系统，完全由Apple自己的AI技术供电，并且它不仅限于新的私人范围，但他们不仅可以掌握私人范围的执行，但他们不仅限于私人云的执行，但他们却无限制地执行了私人构造，但他们却无所不在。基于苹果硅芯片的硬件。最重要的是，作为顶部众所周知的樱桃，苹果<em>还</em>与Chatgpt添加了一个可选的集成层。</p><p>因此，是的，鉴于新闻媒体为苹果自己的实际宣布成就赢得了Openai的荣誉，如果他们不宣布“更个性化的Siri”功能，苹果肯定会得到<em>更少的</em>信誉。很容易想象执行官中的某人争论“<em>我们需要展示只有苹果才能做的事情。</em> ”但事实证明，他们宣布了苹果<em>无法</em>做的事情。现在，他们看上去是如此的深度，因此在他们的头顶上，不仅在AI中最先进的几年后，他们甚至都不知道<em>自己</em>可以发货或<em>何时</em>发货。他们九个月前的标题功能不仅没有发货，而且还没有被证明，我现在认为这意味着他们<em>无法</em>证明它们<em>，因为它们不起作用</em>。</p><h2> “那为什么他妈的不这样做呢？”</h2><p> 2011年5月， <a href="https://fortune.com/article/inside-apple/">Fortune在Adam Lashinsky的苹果内部发表了非凡的外观</a>，我们现在知道这是Steve Jobs时代的山峰和（a）。作品打开了：</p><blockquote><p>苹果并不经常失败，当这样做时，它在1个无限循环时并不是一个漂亮的景象。 2008年夏天，当苹果公司推出了在第三代移动网络上运作的iPhone的第一版时，它还首次推出了Mobileme，这是一种电子邮件系统，该电子邮件系统本来可以提供无缝的同步功能，使公司用户喜欢其BlackBerry智能手机。 Mobileme是个傻瓜。用户抱怨丢失电子邮件，同步充其量是份点。尽管审稿人涌向了新的iPhone，但他们还是在Mobileme服务中付出了很多。</p><p>史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）不容忍傻瓜。发布会结束后不久，他召集了Mobileme团队，将它们聚集在苹果校园4号建筑物的市政厅礼堂，该公司使用该公司为记者提供私密产品揭幕。根据会议的参与者的说法，乔布斯走进去，穿着他的商标黑色模拟高领毛衣和蓝色牛仔裤，紧紧抓住他的手，问了一个简单的问题：</p><p> “谁能告诉我Mobileme应该做什么？”收到令人满意的答案后，他继续说道：“那为什么他妈的不这样做呢？”</p><p>在接下来的半小时工作中，该小组谴责了该小组。他告诉他们：“您已经损害了苹果的声誉。” “你应该互相恨彼此让彼此失望。”公众屈辱特别激怒的工作。沃尔特·莫斯伯格（Walt Mossberg）是有影响力的华尔街日报小工具专栏作家，曾pan omobileme。乔布斯说：“我们的朋友莫斯伯格不再写关于我们的好东西。”当场，乔布斯（Jobs）任命了一名新的高管来管理该小组。</p></blockquote><p>蒂姆·库克（Tim Cook）应该已经举行了这样的会议，以解决和纠正这一Siri和Apple Intelligence崩溃。如果这样的会议尚未发生或没有很快发生，那么我担心，这就是她写的。旅程结束了。当平庸，借口和废话扎根时，他们接管了。卓越，问责制和诚信的文化不能遵守任何这些事物的接受，并且会在接受这三个事物的情况下迅速崩溃。</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-12"><p>图像游乐场将具有很多意义，而不是作为面向消费者的应用程序，而是开发人员的示例项目。很久以前，Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/TextEdit/Introduction/Intro.html">曾经将Textedit的源代码</a>作为Mac开发人员的示例项目。 （不过，Textedit实际上是一个低调的出色应用程序。它确实是有用的，可靠的且易于理解的。） <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/wwdc/2024/">Apple每年在WWDC上共享大量的示例代码</a>。图像游乐场将是一个很棒的样本项目。愚蠢的应用程序图标甚至看起来像WWDC示例项目中的东西。哪个图像游乐场<em>不是</em>一个可信的有用的生成AI工具。然而，苹果一直在谈论它 - 并在新的硬件演示中展示 - 就像他们应该为之骄傲的东西，并且任何人都可以可靠地用于现实世界的工作甚至个人目的。 Image Playground does exemplify just how state-of-the-art the generative AI features are in Apple Intelligence, but not in the way Apple seems to think. <a href="#fnr1-2025-03-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-03-12"><p> Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uarNiSl_uh4?t=3184">the 53-minute mark of Apple&#39;s September “It&#39;s Glowtime” event</a> introducing the iPhones 16, and it&#39;s Craig Federighi who says the following:</p><blockquote><p> “Siri will be able to tap into your personal context to help you in ways that are unique to you. Like pulling up the recommendation for the TV show that your brother sent you last month. And Siri will gain onscreen awareness. So when your friend texts you about a new album, you&#39;ll be able to simply say, &#39;Play that.&#39; And then you&#39;ll be able to take hundreds of new actions in your apps, like updating a friend&#39;s contact card with his new address, or adding a set of photos to a specific album. With Siri&#39;s personal context understanding and action capabilities, you&#39;ll be able to simply say, &#39;Send Erica the photos from Saturday&#39;s barbecue&#39;, and Siri will dig up the photos and send them right off.”</p></blockquote><p> That&#39;s about 40 seconds of keynote time I bet Federighi regrets — and that I suspect <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/09/siri-apple-intelligence-ios-18-development-went-wrong/">he was skeptical about</a> including. It&#39;s telling though, that unlike WWDC, Apple didn&#39;t <em>show</em> those features or spend even a full minute talking about at the iPhone 16 event — despite the fact that, ostensibly, those features should have been three months closer to shipping than they were in June. Federighi&#39;s title is SVP of software, and Apple Intelligence and Siri are “software”, but John Giannandrea (SVP of machine learning and AI strategy) is Federighi&#39;s peer, not subordinate, <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">on the org chart</a> — both report directly to Tim Cook — and is responsible for Siri and Apple Intelligence. Why it was Federighi, not Giannandrea, pitching those features in the iPhone 16 event keynote almost certainly comes down to Federighi&#39;s presentation skills and stage presence, not responsibility for the features themselves. But who&#39;s going on camera to pitch these features and promise their future availability the next time? <a href="#fnr2-2025-03-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</title></entry><entry><title> Brazilian Court Gives Apple 90 Days to Allow Sideloading on iOS </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/06/brazilian-court-apple-sideloading-ios/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/12/brazilian-court-gives-apple-90-days-to-allow-sideloading-on-ios" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41677</id><published> 2025-03-12T16:28:06Z</published><updated> 2025-03-12T17:01:35Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Filipe Espósito, reporting last week for 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> As reported by Brazilian newspaper <a href="https://valor.globo.com/empresas/noticia/2025/03/06/exclusivo-trf-1-suspende-liminar-e-mantem-medida-preventiva-do-cade-contra-a-apple.ghtml">Valor Econômico</a> (via <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/tecnologia/noticia/2025/03/06/trf-1-confirma-decisao-do-cade-e-determina-que-apple-permita-lojas-de-apps-alternativas-no-ios.ghtml">O Globo</a> ), a federal judge in Brazil ruled on Wednesday that Apple will have to open up the iOS ecosystem to third-party apps in Brazil just like the company did in the EU. The judge considers that the “limitations” imposed by the company on developers could jeopardize the entry of new competitors in the segment. [...]</p><p> But now Judge Pablo Zuniga has ordered that Apple will have to implement the required changes in Brazil within the next three months. The judge states that, despite Apple&#39;s claims, the company “has already complied with similar obligations in other countries, without demonstrating a significant impact or irreparable damage to its business model.”</p></blockquote><p> Presumably Apple will just roll out in Brazil the same compliance rules, policies, and APIs that they started offering last year in the EU. But will Brazilian users get access to EU third-party app marketplaces, and vice-versa? Or will Apple try to segregate these app marketplaces region-by-region, such that Brazilian users will only get access to Brazilian third-party app marketplaces, and EU users will remain limited only to EU third-party app marketplaces?</p><p> I asked Riley Testut, the founder of <a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore PAL</a> , if he knew the answers to those questions. His answer, via iMessage:</p><blockquote><p> We haven&#39;t heard anything from Apple (unsurprisingly), but I think it&#39;ll be somewhere in the middle. It&#39;s likely Apple will add some requirements for existing marketplaces to launch in Brazil like they did with EU (eg requiring us to have a subsidiary in Brazil) so we&#39;ll all need to get approval again. But assuming marketplaces meet all requirements, I think users in both places will eventually be able use eg AltStore PAL and Epic Games Store.</p></blockquote><p> “In the middle” sounds about right from Apple&#39;s perspective too. They&#39;re not going to make this as easy as possible, but I don&#39;t expect them to make it obstinately spiteful either.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Brazilian Court Gives Apple 90 Days to Allow Sideloading on iOS’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/12/brazilian-court-gives-apple-90-days-to-allow-sideloading-on-ios">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Adds Disclaimers Regarding Delayed AI Siri Features </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/12/apple-adds-new-disclaimer-on-its-website-advertising-delayed-ai-siri-features/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/12/apple-adds-disclaimers-regarding-delayed-ai-siri-features" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41676</id><published> 2025-03-12T14:41:24Z</published><updated> 2025-03-12T14:41:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/11/a-totally-new-look-for-ios-19-will-likely-have-a-bigger-impact-than-new-siri/">Ben Lovejoy, writing at 9to5Mac</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Our editor-in-chief Chance Miller wryly commented that a radical new look would serve as a great way to distract from the ever-slowing progress on the new Siri. But in truth, I think many more Apple users will be wowed by a new look than would ever care about Siri.</p></blockquote><p> If that&#39;s the way it works out — with a new visual look drawing attention from lackluster progress on the AI front — surely the timing will be coincidental, but some accidents are happy accidents, as Bob Ross used to say.</p><blockquote><p> Sure, the new look introduced with iOS 7 was a massively controversial one, and many thought that then Apple design chief Jony Ive should never have been allowed anywhere near the software side of the business. But love it or hate it, you certainly couldn&#39;t ignore it.</p><p> The same will be true of a new 3D look, which might even include some (much more modern) skeuomorphic elements. Probably as many will hate it as love it when it&#39;s first introduced, as that seems to be true of any significant change made by the company, but it will likely make more of a bang than any improvement to Siri the company may introduce, then or later.</p></blockquote><p> There should be no question that all of what Lovejoy is saying here is true. If Apple launches an all-new systemwide UI theme for iOS 19, something even half as radical a change as iOS 7&#39;s theme was, it will be the <em>only</em> thing most users notice or opine about. Humans are fundamentally visual creatures and we notice visual changes. And, most humans are resistant to change. A lot of people simply dislike change, even changes for the better. (Honestly, I think that&#39;s what the iOS 18 Photos complaints are about. Complaints about change itself.)</p><p> Part of what makes Apple <em>Apple</em> is that the company is (or at least should be) led by people who both have great taste and trust their own instincts. No one&#39;s taste is perfect. Even Steve Jobs pushed through a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/08/siracusa-ive">few</a> <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/apple-history/flower-power-imac-blue-dalmatian">clunkers</a> . But if you have great taste and confidence, you&#39;ll do what your gut says is right.</p><p> When a company only pushes out changes that avoid controversy, it leads to paralysis. Then stagnation. Earlier today, <a href="https://social.panic.com/@cabel/114144740571928406">Cabel Sasser wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> One of my strongest early developer memories was being in the “UI Feedback Forum” at WWDC after they introduced Aqua. Think of a live Q&amp;A, but developers giving notes to a team of Apple engineers.</p><p> To these veteran Mac coders, the reaction to Aqua was universally negative. People were actively very angry.这是浪费！ It&#39;s ugly! It&#39;s confusing! How could you. It went on and on, and I was surprised because Aqua looked cool and fun to me.</p><p> After that WWDC, they never did another Feedback Forum.</p></blockquote><p>是的。 What a lot of Mac users wanted was a Mac OS X that looked like Mac OS 9. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-11"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-11">1</a></sup> The Aqua look and feel was definitely polarizing. And Apple dialed back its most exuberant details with each subsequent Mac OS X update — less transparency, subtler pinstripes (pinstripes!), etc. But iOS 7 was equally polarizing, and its excesses also got dialed back (or perhaps better, said, dialed back up) with each successive iOS release — a little more depth, some subtle hints of texture.</p><p> Either Apple is <em>never</em> going to ship an altogether new UI theme, or they&#39;ll ship one and a large number of people will declare it utter garbage and proof that Apple has completely lost its way. Maybe it <em>will</em> be garbage and proof that Apple has lost its way! Or, maybe it will actually prove to be a great new look that starts a decade-long industry-wide trend that all other companies will soon follow — which is what happened with Aqua&#39;s 3D “lickability”, and happened again with iOS 7&#39;s austere flattening. But either way, you won&#39;t be able to judge it by asking for a show of hands from the general population <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design">when it&#39;s unveiled</a> .

<p>Last week The Wall Street Journal laid off about a dozen tech reporters and editors — not on the fun side, where folks like Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen work, but on the straight news side. Chris Roush at Talking Biz News obtained a memo sent to the staff from WSJ editor-in-chief Emma Tucker, which concluded:</p><blockquote><p> We&#39;re also creating a new Tech &amp; Media enterprise team, reporting to Sarah, and we&#39;re creating two new jobs on this team based in San Francisco. In the coming weeks, we&#39;ll be reconfiguring beats on the tech team to give more of them a wide ambit. Fewer will focus narrowly on individual companies. We are also advertising for a new tech-focused job on Heard in New York.</p><p> These changes do mean that some reporters and editors in San Francisco and New York will be leaving us. I want to thank them for their contributions to the Journal. I want to especially thank Jason Dean, who is departing, for his long and distinguished service.</p></blockquote><p> It was the reporters who focused on specific companies <a href="https://talkingbiznews.com/media-news/here-are-the-wsj-tech-journalists-laid-off-this-week/">who got laid off</a> , including the Journal&#39;s beat reporter for Apple for the last 6 years, Aaron Tilley. Tilley was last in the news himself a month ago, when one of his former sources, a now-former Apple engineer named Andrew Aude, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/07/apple-settles-lawsuit-with-leaker">settled a lawsuit filed by Apple</a> (and who addressed Tilley in text messages as “Homeboy”) and <a href="https://x.com/andyaude1/status/1887639465574998500">issued the following public apology</a> :</p><blockquote><p> I spent nearly eight years as a software engineer at Apple. During that time, I was given access to sensitive internal Apple information, including what were then unreleased products and features. But instead of keeping this information secret, I made the mistake of sharing this information with journalists who covered the company. I did not realize it at the time, but this turned out to be a profound and expensive mistake. Hundreds of professional relationships I had spent years building were ruined. And my otherwise successful career as a software engineer was derailed, and it will likely be very difficult to rebuild it. Leaking was not worth it. I sincerely apologize to my former colleagues who not only worked tirelessly on projects for Apple, but work hard to keep them secret. They deserved better.</p></blockquote><p> I have no idea whether this fiasco had anything to do with Tilley being laid off (perhaps not, given Tucker&#39;s decision to have fewer reporters on staff who “focus narrowly on individual companies”) but it couldn&#39;t have helped. It&#39;s not exactly a ringing endorsement to have someone publicly declaring that they deeply regret ever having been a source for a Wall Street Journal reporter, and that doing so not only cost them their job but ruined their entire career.</p><p> It also probably didn&#39;t help Tilley&#39;s case <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/how-the-wall-street-journal-fell-behind-in-the-apple-is-behind-on-ai-arms-race">that he wasn&#39;t very good at covering Apple</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Aaron ‘Homeboy’ Tilley Among Those Laid Off From the WSJ’s Tech Staff Last Week’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/wsj-tech-layoffs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Steal My Tesla </title><link href="http://stealmytesla.com/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/steal-my-tesla" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41671</id><published> 2025-03-11T18:31:21Z</published><updated> 2025-03-11T18:31:54Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>A clip from this 2016 interview with Marco Rubio — then a candidate for the Republican presidential primary, today Trump&#39;s secretary of state — by CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper is making the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@keithedwards/post/DHBlR9sh7q4">rounds</a> on <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1898914327882551312">social</a> media.这是非凡的。 I&#39;m linking here <a href="https://youtu.be/0J08atDFR2c?t=476">to the full video</a> , hosted on Rubio&#39;s own YouTube account (for now — watch for this to go down the memory hole) starting at the 7:54 mark:</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Tapper:</strong> You compared Donald Trump to a third world dictator yesterday in an interview with The New York Times.为何如此？</p><p> <strong>Rubio:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t know about a dictator. I said a third world strong man. You know, he&#39;s running for president. So no matter what, he won&#39;t be a dictator unless our republic completely crumbles, which I don&#39;t anticipate it will. But, yeah, here&#39;s what happens in many countries around the world: You have a leader that emerges and basically says, <em>Don&#39;t put your faith in yourselves. Don&#39;t put your faith in society. Put your faith in me. I&#39;m a strong leader, and I&#39;m going to make things better — all by myself.</em> This is very typical. You see it in the third world. You see it a lot in Latin America for decades. It&#39;s basically the argument he&#39;s making. That he, single-handedly, is going to turn the country around. We&#39;ve never been that kind of country.</p><p> We have a president. The president is an American citizen who serves for a period of time, constrained by the constitution and the powers vested in that office. The president works for the people, not the people for the president. And if you listen to the way he describes himself and what he&#39;s going to do, he&#39;s going to single-handedly do this and do that without regard for whether it&#39;s legal or not.</p><p> Look, I think people are going to have to make up their mind. I can tell you this. No matter what happens in this election, for years to come, there are many people on the right, in the media, and voters at large that are going to be having to explain and justify how they fell into this trap of supporting Donald Trump, because this is not going to end well one way or the other. He&#39;s going to be the nominee, and he&#39;s going to lose. Or, he&#39;ll have thrown this party into its most chaotic and divisive period ever. And that&#39;s unfortunate because the Republican Party is the home of the limited government free enterprise movement in America. And if it crumbles or divides or it splits apart, it&#39;ll be very difficult to elect candidates that hold those views at any level of government until we can bring the party back together.</p></blockquote><p> Breathtakingly prescient and succinct.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in 2016, on Donald Trump as President: ‘This Is Not Going to End Well One Way or the Other’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/rubio-tapper-2016">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The New Yorker Modernizes a Few Words in Its Style Guide </title><link href="https://www.newyorker.com/newsletter/the-daily/the-new-yorker-house-style-joins-the-internet-age" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5h" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/new-yorker-style-modernizations" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41669</id><published> 2025-03-11T16:34:01Z</published><updated> 2025-03-12T00:14:32Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Andrew Boynton, head of copy at The New Yorker:</p><blockquote><p> Keen-eyed grammar fans may notice some changes in our pages — and in this newsletter. Last fall, David Remnick, the editor, suggested convening a group to talk about the magazine&#39;s house style, to see if any rules might bear reëxamination. The group — comprising copy editors, current and former, and editors — met this past January and came up with a list of styles that might qualify for changes, and in a subsequent meeting the following month the director of copy and production and I came up with a limited list of proposals. It was decided that, while no one wanted to change some of the long-standing “quirky” styles (teen-ager, per cent, etc.), some of newer vintage could go. Along with a few other changes, “in-box” is now “inbox,” “Web site” is now “website,” “Internet” is now “internet,” and “cell phone” is now “cellphone” (though everyone acknowledges that the word “cell” in this context will soon disappear altogether).</p><p> Some of you may lament the changes as being radically modern, while others are likely to greet them as long overdue. <em>Welcome to 1995</em> , you may be thinking. (Italicized thoughts are new, too.) Regardless, it should be noted that the diaeresis (see that “reëxamination,” above) has overwhelming support at the magazine, and will remain.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m in favor of all these changes except for lowercasing “Internet”. I actually started lowercasing it years ago — I think right around <a href="https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/products-and-services/ready-to-lowercase-internet-and-web/">when the AP changed its style</a> — but I was chatting post- <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a> with Ben Thompson a week or two ago and he offhandedly mentioned that lowercasing “internet” is a pet stylistic peeve of his, because there&#39;s only one Internet. He said that and I was like, <em>Yeah! — But so why did I start lowercasing it?</em> The Internet is a lot like the Earth. It&#39;s everywhere. It is our universe, in a sense, from the human-scale perspective. But it&#39;s a unique and distinct thing, thus deserving to be treated as a proper noun. (The universe doesn&#39;t get capitalized because while it&#39;s a one-off, it&#39;s not a name. We speak of <em>the universe</em> like we speak of <em>the planet</em> , which is lowercase.) It&#39;s almost <a href="https://www.cartoonstock.com/cartoon?searchID=CC145273">disrespectful</a> to lowercase it, and the Internet is one of the great achievements in the history of mankind.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The New Yorker Modernizes a Few Words in Its Style Guide’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/new-yorker-style-modernizations">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> New MLB Caps Are So Fugly They Make MAGA Hats Look Well-Designed </title><link href="https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2025/3/10/24382064/mlb-new-overlap-hats-tetas-anaels-new-era" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5g" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/new-mlb-caps" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41668</id><published> 2025-03-11T15:55:12Z</published><updated> 2025-03-11T19:16:04Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

He had a serious mind for facts and numbers and he knew how to work with data. His posts were always overflowing with numbers and charts and levels of detail and nitty gritty I couldn&#39;t pile into my brain because I was too scattered and unfocused. When he said something, you had to take it seriously. When he disagreed with you, you knew it was time to re-check your work. Kevin was almost all signal and very little noise.

<p>Marian Drum, posting yesterday on Kevin Drum&#39;s site:</p><blockquote><p> With a heavy heart, I have to tell you that after a long battle with cancer my husband Kevin Drum passed away on Friday, March 7, 2025.</p><p> No public memorial services are planned.</p><p> In lieu of flowers, please donate to the charity or political cause of your choice.</p></blockquote><p> He was writing right up until the end. No one, on either side of the political spectrum, better wrote about “ <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/?s=dei">DEI</a> ”. Just in the last week, he had posts on <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/trump-plans-to-halt-arms-to-ukraine-sanctions-on-russia/">Ukraine/Russia</a> , the LA Times&#39;s <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/la-times-bias-meter-goes-live/">stupid new AI-generated “bias meter”</a> , the <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/smoke-and-mirrors-budgeting-is-everywhere/">looming congressional budget crisis</a> , <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/destruction-of-canada-begins-tomorrow/">Trump&#39;s tariff crusade</a> . He remained on top of everything that&#39;s going on, not only while cancer was killing him, but while he was stoically keeping his readers fully abreast of his declining health. I mean, Christ, <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/health-update-89/">read this update from February 12</a> — I thought that was it. Dying from cancer is harrowing. He knew the end was near, and as with everything he wrote in his long career, <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/health-update-99/">he had the numbers to back it</a> .</p><p> I didn&#39;t know Drum personally at all, but there&#39;s a certain kinship amongst bloggers from the very turn of the century. I&#39;ve read Drum&#39;s site continuously for over 20 years and I don&#39;t know anyone whose style and approach can fill the void he leaves. He was obviously a very kind and generous person, but his approach to policy was ruthlessly (and thus to me, admirably) data and evidence driven. Strong opinions, loosely held. He brimmed with curiosity. <em>Who</em> , <em>what</em> , <em>when</em> , and <em>where</em> are all good questions but <em>why</em> is the most interesting one, and Drum always wanted to figure out <em>why</em> . I sure didn&#39;t get his love for cats, but I&#39;m also so glad he shared stuff like that. His approach to actual politics could come across as wonky, but his personality was always there. As natural-born a blogger as anyone who&#39;s ever done it.</p><p> I miss his voice already.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kevin Drum, Pioneering Political Blogger and Columnist, Dies at 66’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/kevin-drum">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Front Page Tech on a New UI Style for iOS 19, Back on January 17</title><link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5c" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/10/fpt-ios-19" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41664</id><published> 2025-03-11T01:00:19Z</published><updated> 2025-03-11T01:15:06Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jon Prosser, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">in a YouTube video</a> with mocked-up animations showing exactly what he&#39;s talking about, 51 days ago:</p><blockquote><p> Today we have your very first exclusive look at the changes coming to iOS 19 — with a redesigned camera app and possibly ... a redesigned iOS.</p></blockquote><p> Basic idea is something very much akin to the look and feel of VisionOS, but brought to the Camera app, and perhaps throughout the entire system (or just parts of it) in iOS 19. Seems cool, seems fresh, and seems aligned with where Apple has been heading.</p><p> Here&#39;s Parker Ortolani, himself a talented designer with a particularly keen eye for trends, <a href="https://parker.micro.blog/2025/02/04/apple-invites-screams-that-an.html">writing on his blog February 4 after Apple Invites debuted</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The rumored <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/">Apple Invites</a> app has arrived. While I obviously haven&#39;t had much time to play with it, I have quickly browsed through the UI and wanted to share some observations. The last new Apple app, Apple Sports, already felt out of place in iOS 18. It has a more visionOS or watchOS-like design language utilizing colorful backgrounds, glassy floating UI elements, expanding buttons, and lots of layered shapes. Apple Invites takes it all even further. It&#39;s got big beautiful cards, translucent cells, big bold buttons, and an emphasis on content. It feels so clearly like a hint of what is to come in a future iOS update. It&#39;s almost screaming it in our faces. It seems awfully suspect that Apple&#39;s two latest apps have a whole new design language that does not mesh with the rest of the OS.</p></blockquote><p> Now comes today, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16">Mark Gurman dropping this vagueness at Bloomberg</a> :</p><blockquote><p> The revamp — due later this year — will fundamentally change the look of the operating systems and make Apple&#39;s various software platforms more consistent, according to people familiar with the effort. That includes updating the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons. As part of the push, the company is working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project hasn&#39;t been announced. The design is loosely based on the Vision Pro&#39;s software, they said.</p></blockquote><p>就是这样。 No screenshots. No mockups. No specific description of the changes. Just “loosely based on the Vision Pro&#39;s software”. Jon Prosser not only said this was coming, but commissioned full, realistic animations to illustrate it, <em>51 days ago</em> . And astute observers like Ortolani <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlDeXwQSay8">and others</a> have observed, for over a month, that Apple itself is starting to hint at this new design language in its own already-shipping new apps for iOS.</p><p> I&#39;m so old I remember when YouTubers made videos about months-old Gurman stories, not the other way around. There&#39;s weak sauce, and then there&#39;s eating paste.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Front Page Tech on a New UI Style for iOS 19, Back on January 17’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/10/fpt-ios-19">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Yours Truly Guesting on &#39;Upgrade&#39; With Jason Snell </title><link href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/554" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w5b" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/10/yours-truly-guesting-on-upgrade-with-jason-snell" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41663</id><published> 2025-03-10T22:26:56Z</published><updated> 2025-03-10T22:26:56Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>This whole 1989 profile of Albert “Cubby” Broccoli by John Culhane for the LA Times is full of enjoyable nuggets, but this fact blew my mind:</p><blockquote><p> Giovanni Broccoli and his brother emigrated to Long Island from Calabria at the turn of the century. According to research done in Florence by Broccoli&#39;s wife of 30 years, Dana, the brothers were descended from the Broccolis of Carrera, who first crossed two Italian vegetables, cauliflower and rabe, to produce the dark green, thick-stalked vegetable that took their name and eventually supported them in the United States.</p><p> Giovanni&#39;s brother started a broccoli farm on Long Island, and soon all of Giovanni&#39;s family worked for him. “Myself, my brother, my mother, my father — all working on our hands and knees,” said Broccoli, who picked up the nickname Cubby (after a round-faced comic strip character) at about that time. “Later on, we had our own farm.”</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/02/24/ep-417">Two weeks ago on The Talk Show</a> , I even joked with Paul Kafasis about the fact that in over 30,000 posts in Daring Fireball&#39;s history, the only ones that contain the string “broccoli” are ones about the Bond movies, not the vegetable.

<p>Pierce, David Pierce:</p><blockquote><p> On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of The Vergecast</a> , we talk about the future of Bond. (James Bond.) John Gruber, the author of Daring Fireball and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/the-name-is-prime-james-bond-prime">a preeminent Bond expert</a> , joins the show to talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond">Amazon&#39;s acquisition of MGM</a> , its struggles with the Broccoli family over what to do with the Bond franchise, and why so many fans of the series are worried about what might happen when a company like Amazon takes over a beloved name. Will Bond turn out like Marvel, or Star Wars?还是其他东西？ We&#39;ll see — but history suggests we shouldn&#39;t be too optimistic.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m deeply pessimistic about the future of the Bond franchise, but I do love talking and thinking about it.

<p>Simon Willison:</p><blockquote><p> These new Apple Intelligence features involve Siri responding to requests to access information in applications and then performing actions on the user&#39;s behalf.</p><p> This is the worst possible combination for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a> attacks! Any time an LLM-based system has access to private data, tools it can call and exposure to potentially malicious instructions (like emails and text messages from untrusted strangers) there&#39;s a significant risk that an attacker might subvert those tools and use them to damage or exfiltrate a user&#39;s data.</p><p> I published <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/27/prompt-injection-explained/">this piece</a> about the risk of prompt injection to personal digital assistants back in November 2023, and nothing has changed since then to make me think this is any less of an open problem.</p></blockquote><p> Prompt injection seems to be a problem that LLM providers can mitigate, but cannot completely solve. They can tighten the lid, but they can&#39;t completely seal it. But with your private information, the lid needs to be provably sealed — an airtight seal, not a “ <em>well, don&#39;t turn it upside down or shake it</em> ” seal. So a pessimistic way to look at this personalized Siri imbroglio is that Apple cannot afford to get this wrong, but the nature of LLMs&#39; susceptibility to prompt injection <em>might</em> mean it&#39;s impossible to ever get right. And if it <em>is</em> possible, it will require groundbreaking achievements. It&#39;s not enough for Apple to “catch up”. They have to solve a vexing problem — as yet unsolved by OpenAI, Google, or any other leading AI lab — to deliver what they&#39;ve already promised.</p><p> So Apple had promised for this year — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature">and oft promoted</a> — an entire set of features that they not only have now acknowledged will <em>not</em> ship this year, but which they might, in fact, <em>never</em> be able to ship. Makes me wonder how many people inside Apple were voicing these concerns a year ago, and why they lost the debate to start promising these features last June and advertising them in September.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Simon Willison on the Privacy/Security Risks of Personalized Siri, vis-à-vis Prompt Injection’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/willison-siri-prompt-injection">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Pulls Bella Ramsey Ad That Promoted Vaporware Personalized Siri Feature </title><link href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/07/apple-pulls-ad-that-showed-siri-being-useful-after-delaying-feature-that-could-make-siri-useful/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w56" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41658</id><published> 2025-03-08T19:01:53Z</published><updated> 2025-03-08T23:21:34Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Zac Hall, 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> Since last fall, Apple has been marketing the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence with an unreleased Siri feature. After confirming today that the more personal version of Siri isn&#39;t coming anytime soon, Apple has pulled the ad in question.</p><p> The commercial starred Bella Ramsey who should probably win an award for acting like Siri worked.</p><p> In <a href="https://x.com/iupdate/status/1898102090846925068">the ad spot</a> , Ramsey sees someone familiar approaching and asks Siri the name of the person they had a meeting with the previous month at a specific restaurant.</p><p> Siri immediately responded with the name presumably based on a calendar event, email, or message on Ramsey&#39;s iPhone.</p></blockquote><p> I <em>think</em> that was the only TV commercial Apple ran showing the “personalized Siri through App Intents” feature that Apple has now admitted won&#39;t ship in iOS 18, but I saw that commercial a lot during the baseball playoffs and NFL season. (I tend only to see TV commercials while watching sports.) The other Bella-Ramsey–starring Apple Intelligence ads all showcase Apple Intelligence features that are now shipping. But did Apple run other ads (TV, print, billboard) promoting this non-existent feature? I&#39;m wondering what else they might send down the memory hole now that they&#39;re facing reality on these personalized Siri features.</p><p> Apple&#39;s product pages for <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> , <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> , and <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia/">MacOS 15 Sequoia</a> are lousy with references to these “new era for Siri” features that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">we now know</a> aren&#39;t going to ship this year.

<p>Stephen Nellis, reporting for Reuters:</p><blockquote><p> Some artificial intelligence improvements to Apple&#39;s voice assistant Siri will be delayed until 2026, the company said on Friday.</p><p> In a statement, Apple said it has “been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”</p></blockquote><p> I <em>really</em> don&#39;t mean to be overly pedantic (so I&#39;ve edited this post since original publication), but Apple&#39;s statement reads “in the coming year”, so I think it&#39;s possible we could see those features in iOS 19.0, 19.1, or 19.2 before the end of 2025. Would I want to bet on that? No. This feels like something of a reset, not just a “ <em>we need a few months</em> ” type thing.</p><blockquote><p> Apple did not give a reason for the delays. The iPhone maker had previously indicated the features would come in 2025.</p></blockquote><p> Again, hairsplitting, but I actually think “It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought” is a pretty good explanation.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Reuters on Apple’s Personalized Siri Apple Intelligence Delay’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/07/reuters-siri-delay">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w54" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41656</id><published> 2025-03-07T16:32:00Z</published><updated> 2025-03-12T23:28:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> This announcement is disappointing, but unsurprising.

<p>Here&#39;s a statement I got this morning from Apple spokeswoman Jacqueline Roy, verbatim:</p><blockquote><p> “Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we&#39;ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT.我们还一直在研究一个更个性化的Siri，使其对您的个人背景有了更多的了解，以及在您的应用程序内部和跨应用程序中采取行动的能力。 It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”</p></blockquote><p> This is a Friday sort of <em>wah-waaah</em> sad-trombone news drop, but it&#39;s good that Apple is getting on top of it, and setting expectations accurately.</p><p> Reading between the lines, and based on my PhD-level fluency in Cupertino-ese, what Apple is saying here is that these “more personalized Siri” features are being punted from this year&#39;s OS cycle to next year&#39;s: to iOS 19 and MacOS 16. Apple&#39;s <em>years</em> in this context aren&#39;t calendar years, but Apple&#39;s OS product years. Those years effectively start at WWDC. The problem, from Apple&#39;s perspective, messaging-wise, is that they don&#39;t talk about future products. They haven&#39;t officially acknowledged there is going to be an iOS 19 or MacOS 16. They haven&#39;t even yet announced that there&#39;s going to be a WWDC 2025. But they do want to set expectations accurately, especially for a feature as high profile — from Apple&#39;s own marketing push — as Apple Intelligence.所以我们在这里。</p><p> It was already pretty obvious these features weren&#39;t coming in iOS 18.4/MacOS 15.4, because they&#39;re not in the developer betas that are already out. And if these features were coming in iOS 18.5/MacOS 15.5, or even iOS 18.6/MacOS 15.6, Apple wouldn&#39;t have felt the need to issue this “It&#39;s going to take us longer than we thought...” statement today. Delivering the “more personalized Siri” in iOS 18.5 or even 18.6 would have been delivering them on the originally announced schedule — the “coming year” that began with WWDC 2024. That would have been the tail end of that “year”, but within it. But Apple, being limited to the self-imposed opaque verbiage of Cupertino-ese, isn&#39;t going to spell that out. But trust me, you can bank on it: what they&#39;re announcing today is that these features are coming in iOS 19/MacOS 16.</p><p> Siri <em>has</em> improved in several useful, but iterative, ways under the Apple Intelligence umbrella in this year&#39;s OS cycle (iOS/iPadOS 18 + MacOS 15 Sequoia), but the big “more personalized Siri” that was shown at WWDC last June is the Siri-related Apple Intelligence stuff that people are, justifiably, most excited about. This is the “ <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/integrating-actions-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence">App Intents</a> ” stuff — the features requiring Siri to have access to and, effectively, <em>understanding of</em> your personal information, in your apps, stored privately on your devices. These are the most helpful-sounding, most practical, most futuristic features of Apple Intelligence. And they&#39;re the sort of features Apple is almost uniquely positioned to offer, alongside only Google, as the provider of a mobile platform and device ecosystem.</p><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">From Apple&#39;s own announcement</a> , after the WWDC keynote:</p><blockquote><p> Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that&#39;s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, “Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,” and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, “When is Mom&#39;s flight landing?” and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.</p></blockquote><p> “When is Mom&#39;s flight landing?” is easily understood, by we humans, and a really good example of the sort of Siri interaction that would be obviously useful. But you can also pretty easily see how complex it is on Apple&#39;s side. Siri has long been able to do the “Mom” thing. Your spouse, your kids — you&#39;ve long able to tell Siri to call or text those people by nickname like that. But getting your mom&#39;s flight information out of your email (which I think was the premise of this demo in the WWDC keynote — that the flight info was stored in a message in Mail) or from text messages, and then knowing how to check for current flight status information for <em>that</em> flight, is something far beyond the ken of current Siri. Getting the information requires access to your most personal information — your own email and messages. Getting the <em>correct</em> information from your messages requires the common sense of understanding that you&#39;re obviously asking about some sort of <em>current</em> trip your mom is taking, not, say, an email she sent you about a flight back in 2019, or one from 2022, or even one from December last year. The Siri we currently know <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber">lacks that sort of common sense</a> . And then lastly, after getting the correct flight from your email, performing this task requires Siri to have the agency to go look up the current status of that particular flight — and get it right <em>every time</em> it provides an answer.</p><p> If Siri answers, “Your mom&#39;s flight is arriving at 4:30 this afternoon, and it&#39;s currently showing an on-time arrival,” you really want that information to be correct if you&#39;ve promised to pick her up at the airport. You&#39;ll be annoyed if you drive to the airport and it turns out she&#39;s not actually landing until 7:30. And you&#39;ll be in <em>real</em> trouble if she&#39;s landing at 1:30 and you show up three hours later, having banked on Siri&#39;s answer being accurate.</p><hr /><p> It&#39;s very unusual, to say the least, for Apple to announce a product delay. <sup id="fnr1-2025-03-07"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-07">1</a></sup> The white iPhone 4 was supposed to debut alongside the black one in June 2010, but, bizarrely, was delayed several times ( <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/10/anthropomorphized_white_iphone_4">which I had fun with</a> more than <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-writer-john-gruber-that-white-iphone-i-tweeted-about-was-a-toy-2010-11">once</a> ) and wound up not shipping <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/04/27/jobs-schiller">until the end of April the next year</a> , 10 months late. The original AirPods were announced alongside the iPhones 7 in September 2016, and were supposed to ship in October. They wound up being delayed until December. Apple&#39;s statement in October 2016, regarding the AirPods being delayed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/apple-delays-airpod-rollout-dont-expect-them-in-october/">as given to Matthew Panzarino at TechCrunch</a> :</p><blockquote><p> “The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don&#39;t believe in shipping a product before it&#39;s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.”</p></blockquote><p> This is exactly why Apple hews to an almost religious policy of not announcing products before they&#39;re ready. When they <em>do</em> make exceptions — when they lapse, as it were, as cited above ( <a href="#fn1-2025-03-07">and below</a> ) — they often regret it. You can&#39;t break a promise you never made, and you can&#39;t miss a ship date you never announced. Even with talented teams and realistic managers, there&#39;s often a long span between how long you expect a project to take and how long it actually winds up taking. Engineering schedules often slip even with predictable technologies, and the non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes their future inherently unpredictable.</p><p> Most of Apple Intelligence has felt like Apple has pushed it out a year ahead of the company&#39;s usual level of baked-ness. I&#39;ve held all year long that if the entire industry — along with Wall Street — weren&#39;t in the midst of a generative-AI/LLM mania, that “Apple Intelligence” wouldn&#39;t have been announced until this year&#39;s WWDC, not last year&#39;s. Today&#39;s announcement is disappointing, but to me utterly unsurprising. The Siri integration with personal data through App Intents has never felt like something that was going to be ready for real customer usage in this year&#39;s OS cycle. And if it&#39;s Apple&#39;s general policy not to ship a product before it&#39;s ready, that applies tenfold for a product involving LLM access to deeply private on-device information. It&#39;s better to ship late, but ready, than to ship something unfinished or unreliable to hit a promised deadline. And with something like next-generation Siri, I&#39;d say that&#39;s downright essential. Apple can take the bad publicity today&#39;s announcement is engendering; they cannot afford to squander the trust of their users.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-03-07"><p> The granddaddy of modern-era Apple product delays, of course, is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/airpower">AirPower</a> — the multi-device (iPhones, Apple Watch, AirPods) charging device that Apple pre-announced in September 2017, alongside the iPhone X and iPhone 8.

<p>Oliver Darcy, reporting at Status (paywalled, alas), <a href="https://www.status.news/p/abc-news-layoffs">on the sudden demise of FiveThirtyEight</a> :</p><blockquote><p> On Wednesday morning, shortly after sending an all-staff memo announcing layoffs at ABC News, network president Almin Karamehmedovic joined a virtual meeting with the FiveThirtyEight team. The 15 staffers at the political analysis site owned by ABC News had learned the previous evening — via a Wall Street Journal report — that they were being let go. Now, they were hearing it from Karamehmedovic himself.</p><p> But Karamehmedovic, like other managers carrying out mass layoffs at ABC News that day, had little to say about it. I&#39;m told he appeared to be reading from a script as he delivered the devastating news. He offered no explanation for why the Disney-owned network had decided to shutter FiveThirtyEight, which it acquired in 2018 along with data whiz and then-editor Nate Silver. He took no questions. He simply thanked the employees for their work, told them a human resources staffer would follow up, and ended the meeting. The entire affair, I&#39;m told, lasted about 15 minutes. Soon after, employees had their access to ABC News&#39; systems shut off and the FiveThirtyEight website was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538">pulled offline</a> . Just like that, it was over.</p></blockquote><p> Business is business, and layoffs and closures are never anything but traumatic. But there&#39;s a right way to do things and a wrong way. And one of the wrong ways is having the staff find out they&#39;re all fired by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-to-cut-nearly-6-staff-across-abc-news-disney-entertainment-networks-8af04b40">reading it from The Wall Street Journal</a> . This guy Karamehmedovic sounds like a real Grade-A dickhead.</p><p> And what is the deal with these companies that just unceremoniously pull the plug on websites when they close them? Why not keep the FiveThirtyEight site up and running — at least for a while, if not in perpetuity? It costs practically nothing to run a server for a static/archived website.我不明白。 It betrays a profound level of disrespect for the work that the site hosted. It&#39;s ABC&#39;s business if they want to close FiveThirtyEight as an ongoing concern, but the years of work deserves to remain online, both out of respect for the people who made it <em>and</em> for the audience that might still want to refer to it. Disney didn&#39;t burn the movies from now-closed subsidiary studios like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchstone_Pictures">Touchstone Pictures</a> .</p><p> There&#39;s a vast gulf between the old world of print and the new world of online publishing. The difference is profound, but largely overlooked, because it&#39;s human nature to just adapt to the nature of different forms of media and quickly accept current media forms as “normal”. With print, issues were largely ephemeral to the audience. You&#39;d get a newspaper every day, and magazines every week or month, and you&#39;d throw them out after you&#39;d finished reading them. If you wanted to look back at what the paper had published about something a year, a month, or even just a few days ago, you were out of luck, in terms of being able to just look it up on the spot. Librarians did the yeoman&#39;s work of archiving newspapers and magazines to microfilm, so nothing was truly gone or forgotten, but it was an enormous hassle to access microfilm archives. You pretty much had to know the dates of the issues you wanted to see, and you had to do the “searching” with your eyeballs, page by page. The ability of anyone, today, to just instantly access week-, month-, year-, and even decades-old stories is a breathtaking advantage of web publications. And for the last 15 years or so, we&#39;ve had the ability to do this from little machines we all carry in our pockets everywhere we go. It&#39;s truly remarkable.</p><p> But the standard behavior when closing a web publication is to just pull the plug. When the whole company goes under, that&#39;s one thing. But when there&#39;s a parent company, especially a thriving one, there&#39;s no justification for pulling the plug other than spiteful disregard for the work. From the perspective of a company the size of Disney, it would cost veritable pennies to keep FiveThirtyEight&#39;s website around forever. What a disgrace.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ ABC Shuts Down FiveThirtyEight, and Pulls the Plug on Its Website</title></entry><entry><title> Apple Announces, With Much Surprise, Mac Studios With M4 Max and M3 Ultra (!)

<p>Jason Snell, at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> With the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-review-phenomenal-cosmic-power-itty-bitty-form-factor/">M4 Mac mini</a> being <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/indecision-at-the-intersection-of-mac-studio-and-mac-mini/">powerfully tempting</a> for desktop Mac users who crave power, Apple has upgraded the Mac Studio to blast past the mini in terms of performance. The base model, still starting at $1999, is powered by the M4 Max chip previously available only in the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-m4-pro-macbook-pro-review-brighter-clearer-faster/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> . And the new high-end Mac Studio, starting at the same $3999 price tag, is powered by a monstrous chip with 32 CPU cores (including 24 performance cores) and up to 80 GPU cores. It&#39;s a chip never seen before anywhere — the M3 Ultra.</p><p>你听到了我。 For Apple&#39;s fastest Mac ever — and it&#39;s clear that it will be — Apple&#39;s shipping a chip based on two high-end chips (fused together with Apple&#39;s UltraFusion technology) from Apple&#39;s previous processor generation.怪异，对吗？ It seems like a few things are going on here: first, that the development of the Ultra chip takes longer and that Apple won&#39;t commit to shipping an Ultra chip in every chip generation. Second, that the first-generation three-nanometer chip process of Apple&#39;s chipmaking partner, TSMC, isn&#39;t as dead and buried as generally thought. Just this week Apple also introduced an iPad Air with an M3 processor, and of course the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/10/ipad-mini-2024-review-a-familiar-friend-gets-an-a-i-refresh/">new iPad mini</a> shipped with an A17 Pro processor based on the same process.</p></blockquote><p> This M3/M4 generational fork — the M3 Ultra chip debuting in new Mac Studio models alongside the M4 Max — was so unexpected that, during my embargoed press briefing about the news yesterday, I thought the Apple rep misspoke when he said M3, not M4, for the Ultra models. But no, the Ultra chip really is a generation behind. When asked the obvious question — why — Apple&#39;s answer was straightforward: the Ultra chips take a lot longer to engineer.</p><p> The M4 Max Studio models are, computationally, equivalent (exactly, I think) with the M4 Max MacBook Pros <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/">that debuted October 30</a> , maxing out (no pun intended) at 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores, 8 TB of storage, and 128 GB of RAM. The M4 Max Studio models start at $2,000, but that starting price only gets you a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, 512 GB of storage, and a measly 36 GB of RAM.</p><p> The intriguing M3 Ultra models start at $4,000, which gets you a 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine, 1 TB of storage, and a healthy 96 GB of RAM. Available upgrades to, uh, ultra out the Ultra models:</p><ul><li> 32-core CPU + 80-core GPU: +$1,500</li><li> 256 GB of RAM: +$1,600</li><li> 512 GB of RAM: +$4,000 (only available with the 32-core CPU/80-core GPU)</li></ul><p> SSD storage options for the Ultra models go up to 16 TB (a cool $4,600 over the base storage).</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces, With Much Surprise, Mac Studios With M4 Max and M3 Ultra (!)

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> Let&#39;s start with the surprises. Both M4 MacBook Air models are priced $100 less than their predecessors: $1199 for the 15-inch model and $999 for the 13-incher. If I&#39;m not mistaken, this is the first time that the new-generation design of MacBook Air introduced with the M2 chip has been available at the classic $999 price at launch. (The M1 Air, based on the Intel-era visual design, debuted at $999, but the M2 Air debuted at $1199 and only reached $999 when it was offered as an older model alongside the M3 Air.) As of now, the M4 Air can hold down the sub-$1000 price point all on its own, and previous models are mostly discontinued.</p><p> Another surprise is the the new color option: Space Gray is out. The ultra-dark-blue Midnight remains, as do the classic Silver and hint-of-champagne Starlight. The new color is Sky Blue, which apparently is a metallic light blue that really shows itself as a color gradient when viewed at various angles.</p></blockquote><p> Very cool that the new M4 starts at $999.

<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg on 6 December 2024, regarding Apple&#39;s first in-house cellular modem, “ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027">Apple Plans Three-Year Modem Rollout in Bid to Top Qualcomm</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> For now, the modem won&#39;t be used in Apple&#39;s higher-end products. It&#39;s set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23, that features a far-thinner design than current models. The chip will also start rolling out as early as 2025 in Apple&#39;s lower-end iPads.</p></blockquote><p> We now know the name of that modem, the C1, from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">its debut in the iPhone 16e last month</a> . Then, also on December 6, in a separate report headlined “ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets">Apple Explores Macs, Headsets With Built-In Cellular Data</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> The first modem will also appear in low-end iPads next year, with the 2026 update coming to Pro versions of the iPhone and iPad.</p></blockquote><p> The cellular models of the new 11th generation iPads announced yesterday do not, it turns out, use the C1. The specs don&#39;t match those of the iPhone 16e, and when I asked an Apple representative, they confirmed that none of the new iPads (including the Airs) use the C1 modem. (But, Apple reassured me, they all offer terrific cellular networking.)</p><p> I&#39;m not saying Gurman was wrong, because there are nine full months left in 2025 for Apple to release a 12th-generation low-end iPad with the C1. The previous (10th) generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-unveils-completely-redesigned-ipad-in-four-vibrant-colors/">came out in October 2022</a> , but the 9th generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apples-most-popular-ipad-delivers-even-more-performance-and-advanced-features/">came in September 2021</a> , just 13 months prior. And this week&#39;s new M3 iPad Airs replaced M2 models that <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">arrived just 10 months ago</a> . But, you know, it sure seems doubtful Apple is going to rev this hardware in 2025, so I&#39;ll place my bet that he was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads">wrong about this too</a> .</p><p> (And yes, a Bloomberg Terminal subscription really does <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bloomberg_terminal.asp">start at $32,000/year per seat</a> .)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Who Cares About Getting News That’s True When You’re Getting It Fast With a $32,000/Year Bloomberg Terminal Subscription?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Mark Gurman, Ace Reporter, on the New Regular iPads </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41648</id><published> 2025-03-06T00:16:07Z</published><updated> 2025-03-06T00:21:38Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Gurman, in his Power On column for Bloomberg, on January 12:</p><blockquote><p> The new entry-level iPads — J481 and J482 — will get faster processors and Apple Intelligence. The current models have the A14 chip and 4 gigabytes of memory. Look for the new versions to have the A17 Pro chip, matching the iPad mini, and a bump to 8 gigabytes of memory. That&#39;s the minimum needed to support the new AI platform.</p></blockquote><p> The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates">new iPads</a> sport the A16 chip and thus do not support Apple Intelligence. But who cares about little details like that when you know the codenames, which is what really matters.</p><p> I&#39;ll bet what happened is that Gurman was right, and the new iPads were set to use the A17 Pro chip and support Apple Intelligence.

<p>Mark Gurman, yesterday at noon ET:</p><blockquote><p> It&#39;s not an “Air” — but the new Mac Studio, codenamed J575, appears to be imminent. It could be announced as early as this week along with the new MacBook Airs. There are signs these will come with an M4 Max but that its new Ultra chip will actually be an M3 Ultra.</p></blockquote><p> Quite the scoop breaking this news after Apple started briefing media about it under NDA yesterday.</p><p> He&#39;s not fooling anyone by dropping the J575 codename (which Apple would never include in a media briefing). That&#39;s a bit of ham-fisted misdirection to make it seem like his source for this came from a product-aware source inside Apple, when in fact he almost certainly got it from someone in the media yesterday. (Codenames in and of themselves aren&#39;t much of a secret inside Apple. That&#39;s one reason they keep them so boring: <em>letter-digit-digit-digit</em> , usually.)</p><p> Apple conducted virtual media briefings yesterday for the iPad (M3 iPad Airs and A16 regular iPads) and Mac (M4 MacBook Airs and M4 Max/M3 Ultra Mac Studios). Apple announced the new iPads on Apple Newsroom yesterday morning at 9:00am ET, <em>before</em> those media briefings took place — the briefings were a recap of the announced news. Apple announced the new Macs today at 9:00am ET, <em>after</em> yesterday&#39;s media briefings, which were under embargo until this morning. If you think it&#39;s a coincidence that Gurman dropped zero last-minute tidbits about the new iPads (which were not briefed to the press ahead of time), but did drop the surprise M3 Ultra Mac Studio news (which was briefed, under embargo, ahead of time), I have a bridge to sell you.</p><p> He did the same thing with the VisionOS 2.4 news (Apple Intelligence, the new Spatial Gallery app, guest mode improvements). Apple held media briefings to share this news on Friday 14 February, under the condition that it was embargoed until the VisionOS 2.4 beta <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-intelligence-comes-to-apple-vision-pro-in-april/">dropped the next week</a> . But Gurman ran a report at Bloomberg with the embargoed info <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/apple-vision-pro-visionos-2-4-adds-apple-intelligence-spatial-content">on Saturday 15 February</a> . The only stuff he&#39;s right about lately is what he gets from someone (or someones?) in the media leaking him embargoed info. It&#39;s not going to take Sherlock Holmes for Apple to figure this out, especially when most of the Mac briefings yesterday were later in the day, after Gurman&#39;s tweets. I&#39;d put even money on him burning his source yesterday.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Your Source for Scoops Half a Day Before They’re Announced Publicly’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/your-source-for-scoops">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Trump 2.0 Is More Idiocracy Than Kakistocracy </title><link href="https://bsky.app/profile/ronfilipkowski.bsky.social/post/3ljj4sijyrk24" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/trump-2-idiocracy-chickens" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41645</id><published> 2025-03-05T01:46:47Z</published><updated> 2025-03-05T03:10:25Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ron Filipkowski:</p><blockquote><p> Trump&#39;s Sec of Agriculture Brooke Rollins says the solution to high egg prices for Americans is to get some chickens and raise them in your backyard.</p></blockquote><p> No exaggeration. She&#39;s selling the idea of everyone raising chickens in their back yards as “awesome”, with a laugh and a smile. And then the Fox News host (Rachel Campos-Duffy — wife of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy — this whole world is comprised of socially-inbred reality-TV has-beens), smiling and laughing, concludes with “I think everyone who isn&#39;t a farmer right now wants to be, so you&#39;re in the right department, Brooke!”</p><p> This is a cult.

<p>Zac Hall, writing at 9to5Mac:</p><blockquote><p> Leitmotif, the team behind the awesome diff and merge Mac app Kaleidoscope, is expanding its portfolio of native Mac apps for developers. The company has acquired Taska, a native Mac app that serves as a frontend for web services like GitHub and GitLab. [...] To celebrate its release of Taska 1.3, Leitmotif is <a href="https://leitmotif.dev/promotion">discounting its apps by 50%</a> for a limited time.</p></blockquote><p> When Taska debuted last year, its original developers (Made by Windmill) sponsored DF for the week to promote it (the app was briefly named Sonar, before some sort of legal contretemps prompted a change), and thanking them, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/25/sonar">I wrote</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Taska combines the lightweight UI of a to-do app with the power of enterprise-level issue tracking, all in a native app built by long-time Mac nerds. The interface is deceptively simple, and very intuitive. Fast and fluid too. Everything that&#39;s great about native Mac apps is exemplified by Taska. If you&#39;ve ever thought, “Man, if only Apple made a native GitHub client...”, you should run, not walk, to download it.</p><p> Taska saves all your changes directly to GitHub/GitLab using their official APIs, so your data remains secure on GitHub&#39;s servers — not Taska&#39;s. Do you have team members not using Taska?没问题。 Changes you make in Taska are 100% compatible with the web UI.</p></blockquote><p> Leitmotif&#39;s Kaleidoscope is a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/17/kaleidoscope-20">longtime</a> stalwart in any Mac nerd&#39;s toolbox. I can&#39;t think of a better sibling to an app like Taska. (A few weeks ago I ran into a gnarly syncing glitch with a long log file, where there wasn&#39;t just an old version and new one, but two different “new” versions from two different machines. Kaleidoscope got me out of that jam, no sweat.)</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Taska Is Now Part of Leitmotif (Developers of Kaleidoscope)’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/taska-leitmotif">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;When Your Last Name Is Null, Nothing Works&#39; </title><link href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/null-last-name-computer-scientists-forms-f0a43b08?st=2u7onu" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4r" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/null" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41643</id><published> 2025-03-05T00:15:27Z</published><updated> 2025-03-07T16:12:33Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Funny piece — if your surname isn&#39;t “Null” — by Oyin Adedoyin for The Wall Street Journal ( <a href="https://apple.news/AsGIvBkziTEqE5V7eOvF-Tg">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> Even those without the last name Null are finding themselves caught in the void. Joseph Tartaro got a license plate with the word “NULL” on it nearly 10 years ago. The 36-year-old security auditor thought it would be funny to drive around with the symbol for an empty value. Maybe a police officer who tried to give him a ticket would end up writing null into the system and not be able to process it, he joked to himself.</p><p> In 2018 he paid a $35 parking ticket. Soon afterward, he said, his mailbox was flooded with hundreds of traffic tickets for incidents he hadn&#39;t been involved in. Tickets were from other counties and cities for vehicles of different colors, makes and models. A database had associated the word “null” with his personal information and citations were sent to Tartaro, who lives in Los Angeles.</p></blockquote><p> Brings to mind the classic “ <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">Little Bobby Tables</a> ” from XKCD.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘When Your Last Name Is Null, Nothing Works’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/null">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Money Job&#39; </title><link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/opinion/ben-stiller-gene-hackman.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1k4.SQm-.jbz9WEyoATEH&amp;smid=url-share" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4q" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/money-job" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41642</id><published> 2025-03-05T00:04:09Z</published><updated> 2025-03-05T00:04:09Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ben Stiller, in a delightful piece for The New York Times on working up the gumption to tell Gene Hackman — with whom he was working in Wes Anderson&#39;s excellent <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> , his favorite Hackman movie:</p><blockquote><p> “ … but I have to say for me, there is one movie you made that means so much to me. It might sound crazy, but I think it&#39;s the reason I wanted to make movies. It&#39;s &#39;The Poseidon Adventure.&#39; It literally was my favorite movie when it came out. I think I was 7 or something and I went to see it in the theater about 10 times, then watched it repeatedly whenever it was on TV. It was so formative, and you were so good in it, and it just for me was my favorite movie for so long because of the excitement of that incredible score and those actors and the action and just all of it. It really changed my life and just … made me want to make movies.”</p><p> He smiled a little. He looked forward, thinking, perhaps about the movie, as if it hadn&#39;t crossed his mind for a long time. Then he grinned and said:</p><p> “Money job.”</p></blockquote><p> I can hear those words in Hackman&#39;s voice. And I can see the grin.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘Money Job’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/money-job">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Updates iPad Air (M2→M3) and Regular iPad (A14→A16), and Revamps Magic Keyboard for iPad Air </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/03/apple-updates-ipad-air-and-ipad-revamps-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4p" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41641</id><published> 2025-03-04T20:01:53Z</published><updated> 2025-03-04T20:10:55Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> The most consequential part of the Air&#39;s update — perhaps the <em>only</em> real update — is the M3 processor, which brings with it GPU-based capabilities like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and video encoding and decoding for ProRes and ProRes RAW.</p><p> Otherwise, the Air is basically unchanged: it comes in 11-inch and 13-inch versions, features the same cameras, battery life, the exact same dimensions, and the same accessory compatibility as its M2-based predecessor. It even comes in the same colors — Space Gray, Blue, Purple, and Starlight — at the same prices starting at $599.</p></blockquote><p> A true speed-bump update — no big whoop, but it&#39;s good for the platform for devices to get regular speed-bump updates in between major new revisions. The previous M2 iPad Air models only came out in May of last year, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/05/brief_thoughts_and_observations_on_yesterdays_let_loose_ipad_keynote">alongside the M4 iPad Pro models</a> . <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/ipad-air-m2-9-core-gpu">Just like those M2 iPad Air models</a> , these new M3 iPad Airs have 9-core GPUs. The current (not for long?) M3 MacBook Airs are offered with 8- and 10-core GPUs. I presume these 9-core M3 chips used for the iPad Air are <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/glossary-binning-definition,5892.html">binned chips</a> that didn&#39;t have 10 good GPU cores?</p><blockquote><p> The new Magic Keyboard for Air is interesting in that it seems to meld parts of the older Magic Keyboard with the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/05/some-hands-on-ipad-event-impressions/">last May</a> . While the new Magic Keyboard includes a function row and a larger trackpad like its Pro compatriot, it lacks haptics in the trackpad and backlit keys, and it seems to be built on the same design of the original silicone exterior instead of the new aluminum-based model. But you get some cost savings for that: it&#39;s just $269 instead of $299. Also, it only comes in white — black keyboards are for pros, I guess.</p></blockquote><p> $269 feels like a crummy deal. The new-from-last-year $299 Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, with an aluminum top, feels way more than $30 better than the old-style silicone-covered ones like this new Magic Keyboard for iPad Air. It kind of feels like a design failure of some sort that these new iPad Airs can&#39;t use the same Magic Keyboards as the iPad Pros of the same size.</p><blockquote><p> The base iPad&#39;s update is perhaps somewhat more disappointing, as that model was introduced in 2022 and its A16 processor will make it one of the few current main-line Apple devices — perhaps only — not to support Apple Intelligence.</p></blockquote><p> The recently updated iPad Mini ( <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-powerful-new-ipad-mini-built-for-apple-intelligence/">October</a> ) has an A17 Pro chip, and thus supports Apple Intelligence. But the iPad Mini starts at $500, and the regular iPad still starts at just $350. The just-plain iPad is really the only “budget” device that Apple makes. There are no iPhone or Mac models in that price range.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Updates iPad Air (M2→M3) and Regular iPad (A14→A16), and Revamps Magic Keyboard for iPad Air’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/moren-ipad-air-ipad-updates">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Apple Hasn&#39;t Updated Its US Government Transparency Report Since June 2023, 20 Months Ago </title><link href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/apple-us-government-transparency-report-20-months" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41640</id><published> 2025-03-04T19:13:31Z</published><updated> 2025-03-04T20:30:19Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, writing for iFixit:</p><blockquote><p> But it&#39;s still missing MagSafe, for no obvious reason other than making the phone less appealing to consumers than the rest of the 16 lineup. Wireless charging without the perfect alignment that MagSafe allows is troubling.</p></blockquote><p> I&#39;ve been waiting for iFixit&#39;s teardown to see if removing MagSafe components might help explain the 16e&#39;s physically larger battery. It doesn&#39;t seem to. The 16e battery seems taller, not thicker, and the MagSafe components in an iPhone 15 don&#39;t seem thick or space consuming. But there remains a very obvious reason for its exclusion: cost. The 16e is priced $200 less than a comparable regular 16, so something has to give, and MagSafe, alas, is one of those things.</p><p> The 16e did garner a 7/10 repairability score — very high for an Apple product from iFixit. But their party line is that you still shouldn&#39;t buy one, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108337/why-a-refurbished-iphone-might-be-better-and-cheaper-than-a-brand-new-iphone-16e">opting instead for a refurbished older iPhone 14</a> . Refurb iPhones are great, and they&#39;re popular for a reason, but it feels like recommending refurb over new is dogma for iFixit at this point. When&#39;s the last time they recommended any new product? For $600 I think it&#39;s hard to beat a new iPhone 16e for current value and future-proofing.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘iFixit’s iPhone 16e Teardown’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/ifixit-iphone-16e-teardown">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Free Speech Will Continue Until Trump&#39;s Morale Improves </title><link href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114104167452161158" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w4m" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/trump-protests" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/linked//6.41638</id><published> 2025-03-04T17:21:14Z</published><updated> 2025-03-04T17:21:14Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

[...]</p><p> Here are the ways Framous aims to streamline this process:</p><ul><li> Auto-detect your device based on your screenshot to pick the right frame from a growing library of devices</li><li> Combine multiple devices into a single image, or bulk export multiple separate images at once</li><li> Quick customization options to change frame colors and more</li><li> Automate your screenshot framing with Shortcuts support for even more efficient workflows</li></ul></blockquote><p> There are a bunch of ways you can add device frames to screenshots like this, but none as clever, fast, and easy as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/framous-screenshot-frames/id6636520519?mt=12">Framous</a> .我喜欢它。 So many little details. You can just drop a screenshot in and copy a framed version out with zero fuss, but there are also all sorts of tweaks and adjustments you can make, right down to choosing which shade of titanium to color your specific iPhone Pro model.

<p>Nora Deligter, writing for Screen Slate in June 2023, “ <a href="https://www.screenslate.com/articles/elegy-screenshot">Elegy for the Screenshot</a> ”:</p><blockquote><p> About five years ago, Catherine Pearson started taking screenshots of every bouquet featured on <em>The Nanny</em> (1993–1999), the six-season CBS sitcom that was then streaming on Netflix. She was just becoming a florist, and she found the arrangements — ornate, colorful, and distinctly tropical — inspirational. She now keeps them in a folder on her desktop, alongside screenshots of flower arrangements featured on <em>Poirot</em> (1989–2013), the British detective drama. A few months ago, however, Pearson suddenly found that when her fingers danced instinctively toward Command-Shift-3, she was greeted by a black box where her flowers used to be, a censored version of what she had meant to capture.</p><p> It was around this time when streaming platforms like Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, and the Criterion Channel imposed a quiet embargo on the screenshot. At first, there were workarounds: users could continue to screenshot by using the browser Brave or by downloading extensions or third-party tools like Fireshot. But gradually, the digital-rights-management tech adapted and became more sophisticated. Today, it is nearly impossible to take a screenshot from the most popular streaming services, at least not on a Macintosh computer. [...]</p><p> For PC users, this story takes a different, and happier, turn. With the use of Snipping Tool — a utility exclusive to Microsoft Windows, users are free to screen grab content from all streaming platforms. This seems like a pointed oversight, a choice on the part of streamers to exclude Mac users (though they make up a tiny fraction of the market) because of their assumed cultural class. This assumption isn&#39;t unreasonable. Out of everyone interviewed for this article, only one of them was a PC user.</p></blockquote><p> Deligter&#39;s essay has been sitting in my long (and ever-growing) list of things to link to ever since she published it back in 2023. I referenced it in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/01/green-imessage-disappearing-messages">my post earlier today</a> re: <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/03/01/dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage-right-now/">Matthew Green&#39;s entreaty to Apple</a> to add “disappearing messages” to iMessage, and re-reading it made me annoyed enough to finally write about it.</p><p> I&#39;m not entirely sure what the technical answer to this is, but on MacOS, it seemingly involves the GPU and video decoding hardware. These DRM blackouts happen at such a low level that no high-level software — any sort of utility you might install — can route around them. I think Windows still offers easy screenshotting of frames from DRM video not because the streaming services somehow don&#39;t care about what Windows users do (which, when you think about it, would be a weird thing <em>not</em> to care about, given Windows&#39;s market share), but because Windows uses a less sophisticated imaging pipeline. Or perhaps rather than less <em>sophisticated</em> , it&#39;s more accurate to say less <em>integrated</em> . These DRM blackouts on Apple devices (you can&#39;t capture screenshots from DRM video on iPhones or iPads either) are enabled through the deep integration between the OS and the hardware, thus enabling the blackouts to be imposed at the hardware level. And I don&#39;t think the streaming services opt into this screenshot prohibition other than by “protecting” their video with DRM in the first place. If a video is DRM-protected, you can&#39;t screenshot it; if it&#39;s not, you can.</p><p> On the Mac, it used to be the case that DRM video was blacked-out from screen capture in Safari, but not in Chrome (or the dozens of various Chromium-derived browsers). But at some point a few years back, you stopped being able to capture screenshots from DRM videos in Chrome, too — <em>by default</em> . But in Chrome&#39;s Settings page, under System, if you disable “Use graphics acceleration when available” and relaunch Chrome, boom, you can screenshot everything in a Chrome window, including DRM video. You can go to the magic URL <code>chrome://gpu/</code> before and after toggling this setting to see a full report on the differences — as you&#39;d expect, it turns off all hardware acceleration for video encoding/decoding, compositing, and more. You wouldn&#39;t want to browse like this all the time (certainly not on battery power), but it&#39;s a great trick to know for capturing stills from videos.</p><p> What I don&#39;t understand is why Apple bothered supporting this in the first place for hardware-accelerated video (which is all video on iOS platforms — there is no workaround like using Chrome with hardware acceleration disabled on iPhone or iPad). No one is going to create bootleg copies of DRM-protected video one screenshotted still frame at a time — and even if they tried, they&#39;d be capturing only the images, not the sound. And it&#39;s not like this “feature” in MacOS and iOS has put an end to bootlegging DRM-protected video content. This “feature” accomplishes nothing of value for anyone, including the streaming services, but imposes a massive (and for most people, confusing and frustrating) hindrance on honest people simply trying to easily capture high-quality (as opposed to, say, using their damn phone to take a photograph of their reflective laptop display) screenshots of the shows and movies they&#39;re watching.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Why Can&#39;t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices? </title></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w40" rel="shorturl"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025://1.41616</id><published> 2025-02-27T03:47:35Z</published><updated> 2025-03-01T00:26:59Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text"> The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don&#39;t want to think much about their phone. But they *do* want an iPhone, not just any “whatever” phone. A just plain iPhone, with a good screen, good enough (and simple) camera, and great battery life. </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I&#39;ve spent the last six days using the iPhone 16e, and the experience has been a throwback. In many ways, the iPhone 16e both looks and feels like the modern-day progeny of the early Steve Jobs era iPhones. Early iPhones like the plastic 3G and 3GS, and the glass-back/metal-sides 4 and 4S were simpler offerings. Two colors, black and white. Single-lens inconspicuous cameras. The iPhone 16e feels like their direct descendent.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with the camera. With just a single lens on the back, the iPhone 16e camera doesn&#39;t just <em>look</em> less conspicuous compared to its dual- and triple-lens brethren, it <em>feels</em> less conspicuous. Especially for me, coming from several years of daily-driving an iPhone Pro model, the 16e feels strikingly smaller in hand and pocket because it lacks the entire “mesa” protrusion from which iPhone 16 and 16 Pro camera lenses further protrude.</p><p> Apple&#39;s tech specs for iPhone thickness don&#39;t include the camera lenses or camera mesas. Apple just measures and reports the thickness of the flat non-camera part of the phone. But those camera modules and lenses protrude quite a bit. Using a digital caliper, I measured the thickness of the three “levels” of the 16e, regular 16, and 16 Pro:</p><p><table class="table-1C94D92B-727A-4CC3-8A3B-18EA7E38C1D7" width = 350><style>

  /></a></p><p> The iPhone 16e looks like a phone with a tiny camera on the back. The iPhone 16 Pro looks like a camera that also happens to be a phone. You can really feel the difference in hand, too — not just the weight, but the balance. <sup id="fnr1-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-26">1</a></sup> You can feel that the 16 Pro&#39;s extra camera hardware adds extra weight. Per Apple&#39;s specs, the iPhone 16e weighs 167g; the 16 Pro 199g — a 16 percent difference. (Also take note of a clever touch: Apple&#39;s default wallpapers for each phone subtly suggest how many camera lenses they have.)</p><p> The 16e camera lens is not flush with the back of the phone, but it protrudes so little (just 1.7mm by my measurement) that it harks back to when iPhone cameras <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">first started jutting out</a> from the back of the phones at all. The 16e still wobbles when laid on a tabletop, but dramatically less than a regular iPhone 16 or especially the iPhone 16 Pro, whose camera module seems downright bulbous in comparison. But the 16e&#39;s 1.7mm camera lens protrusion is so minimal that, when put in a case, the phone <em>does</em> lay perfectly flat on a table, because the cases need no protective rim for the camera, because the 16e camera lens protrudes less than the thickness of the case. (Apple included two of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD3P4ZM/A/iphone-16e-silicone-case-white">$39 Silicone Cases</a> with my review kit, in blue and black. They&#39;re fine, and feel exactly like Apple&#39;s usual Silicone Cases.)</p><p> Because the “macro” mode on the recent regular and Pro iPhone models uses the 0.5× ultrawide camera, a secondary lens the 16e doesn&#39;t have, the 16e doesn&#39;t have a macro mode. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-macro-camera-a-big-day-for-small-things/">Starting with the iPhone 13 Pro</a> , macro mode has allowed iPhone Pros to focus on objects less than an inch away. But, because the 16e&#39;s 1× camera has a smaller sensor and smaller lens than the 1× camera on more expensive iPhone models, it&#39;s able to focus at shorter distances than those bigger and otherwise better 1× cameras. The 1× camera on an iPhone 16 Pro has a minimum focus distance of 24cm (~9.5 inches). The 1× camera on an iPhone 16e has a minimum focus distance of 12cm (~4.75 inches). Actual macro mode (on regular and Pro iPhone models) is better, but you don&#39;t need it as much when the 16e&#39;s lone camera can focus on objects at half the distance, just over 4 inches away, in its regular shooting mode.</p><p> The 16e&#39;s inconspicuous camera comes with a price, of course: image quality. You can really see the difference in low light. The 16e camera is slower (resulting in blurry images with subjects in motion) and images are noisier. The difference is especially obvious when shooting in low light with <a href="https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Process Zero in Halide</a> . It&#39;s a fine camera though, for point-and-shoot purposes. For most people who might be considering the iPhone 16e, it&#39;ll probably be the best camera they&#39;ve ever owned. And there&#39;s something to be said for the simplicity of just one lens, offering 1× and 2× fields of view. If you know what an ƒ-stop is, you probably shouldn&#39;t buy an iPhone 16e. If you don&#39;t know what an ƒ-stop is, you probably won&#39;t notice any difference in camera quality from an iPhone 16 or even 16 Pro. It&#39;s a perfect camera for anyone who just wants a decent camera.</p><h2> What&#39;s Missing: MagSafe, ProMotion, and Ultra Wideband (and, uh, the Other Ultra Wideband)</h2><p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16-pro,iphone-16,iphone-16e">Peruse Apple&#39;s comparison page</a> , comparing the 16e to the 16 Pro and regular 16, and you&#39;ll spot dozens of small differences. But the one omission that grabbed the most attention (and generated the most “WTF Apple?” reactions) is MagSafe. I own a bunch of MagSafe peripherals, and personally would never want to buy an iPhone without it. I have <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-carbide">a dock</a> at my desk (great with <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-standby-iph878d77632/ios">StandBy mode</a> ), a <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger">charger at my nightstand</a> , and convenient doodads like <a href="https://www.moft.us/products/case-stand-wallet-snap-set?variant=39411246989399">this magnetic folding stand</a> . One week into using the 16e as my main phone, and I still miss MagSafe as much as I did the first night.</p><p> But according to Apple representatives, most people in the 16e&#39;s target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable. They tend not to use inductive charging at all, and when they do, they might not care that the 16e is stuck with a pokey 7.5W Qi charging speed, when recent more expensive iPhones charge via MagSafe at 15W or even 25W. For me, it&#39;s not the high charging speed I miss most; it&#39;s the snapping into place. <sup id="fnr2-2025-02-26"><a href="#fn2-2025-02-26">2</a></sup> I think Apple knows the 16e&#39;s intended audience better than I do. Daring Fireball readers aren&#39;t in the 16e demographic; it&#39;s the friends and family members of DF readers who are.</p><p> What features do typical low-end iPhone buyers care about? They want a phone that looks good, with a good display, a decent camera, and long battery life. Do they care that the 16e only supports Wi-Fi 6, not 7? No, because they have zero idea what Wi-Fi version numbers even mean. They just think Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi. Do they care about superspeed mmWave 5G networking from Verizon (aka “ultra wideband”)? No. They just want their cellular connection to be fast and strong. (My review unit from Apple came with a temporary eSIM on AT&amp;T. Cellular connections were fast and strong all week. The only place where I noticed a weak signal was in a deeply suburban / borderline rural area while visiting family over the weekend; my wife&#39;s iPhone 15 Pro Max lost its signal on Verizon at the same location. I have zero complaints about Apple&#39;s C1 modem.)</p><p> The iPhone 16e also omits <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109021">the <em>other</em> “ultra wideband”</a> , the chip Apple uses for precise location detection — like tracking an AirPod to within a foot. Precision finding is super cool, and when you&#39;re truly bedeviled by a lost item like a keychain, remarkably helpful. Ultra wideband has been included on all new iPhones other than the SE (and now 16e) since the iPhones 11 in 2019. From a nerd&#39;s perspective, it really does seem like a curious omission from the 16e five years later. But how many people in your extended family know what “ultra wideband precision finding” is?</p><p> To date, only Apple&#39;s iPhone Pro models have supported ProMotion — Apple&#39;s marketing name for a display that features adaptive refresh rates that go up to 120 Hz and down to 1 Hz for the “Always On” display mode. Given that the regular iPhone 16 (and 16 Plus) don&#39;t support ProMotion, there was zero chance the 16e would. There are mid-range Android phones with high-refresh-rate displays, but (a) I don&#39;t think they&#39;re <em>better</em> displays, all things considered, and (b) they&#39;re mid-range Android phones. It&#39;s like bragging about the refresh rate on the dashboard display in a Kia Sorento. The 16e display also sports a throwback notch in lieu of the fancier, more playful, and at times cleverly useful, dynamic island.</p><p> The iPhone 16e targets the “I only care about the basics” iPhone buyer: the screen looks good, the camera is good but simple, the battery lasts a long time (the difference should be quite striking for anyone upgrading from a four- or five-year-old iPhone), it runs all their existing apps, and it charges fast when plugged into a USB cable. Those are the basics, and the basics are all that casual users care about. That it&#39;s lighter in weight and physically smaller thanks to its minimally protruding single camera lens is gravy.</p><h2>定价</h2><p>The only aspect of the 16e garnering more discussion than its omission of MagSafe is its starting price of $600 for a 128 GB base model. “It should cost $100 less” say some people, who tend to be the same people who <em>also</em> strongly believe it should include MagSafe and a ProMotion display. Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s current iPhone lineup, plus the discontinued (but <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022.html?q=iphone%20se">still</a> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-se-3rd-generation-64gb-unlocked-black/6507470.p?skuId=6507470">available</a> from <a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/prepaid-phones/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022-64gb-midnight">some</a> carriers) 3rd-generation SE: </p><table class="table-7940E2A4-0011-4258-A4DA-D506F80A4F67" width=500 style="margin-left: 0;"><style>

The new 16e starting at $600 makes more sense than the old SE starting at just $430. $600 is clearly the next logical “rung” under the year-old iPhone 15&#39;s $700 starting price. Complaining that Apple no longer makes a phone that&#39;s priced in the $400-500 range is like complaining that BMW no longer makes any cars that cost less than $40,000. They&#39;re Apple. It&#39;s an iPhone. Of course it costs more than a no-name Android phone, or the 27th model down the ladder in Samsung&#39;s sprawling product lineup. Anyone who wants to spend less than $600 for an iPhone can buy one from the flourishing pre-owned/refurbished market — just like buying a BMW for under $40,000.</p><p> The iPhone 16e is an iPhone for people who don&#39;t want to think much about their phone. But they <em>do</em> want an iPhone, not just any “whatever” phone. A just plain iPhone, with a good screen, good enough (and simple) camera, and great battery life. I think Apple nailed that with the iPhone 16e.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2025-02-26"><p> There&#39;s a decided <em>feel</em> difference with the side rails of the 16e too. The sides feel sharper, less rounded, than the regular 16 and 16 Pro (and the 15/15 Pro, and 14/14 Pro ...). That squareness (sharp-cornered-ness?) isn&#39;t bad, per se, but it does subtly convey a sense of the 16e being a less premium device. <a href="#fnr1-2025-02-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2-2025-02-26"><p> One of the most surprising aspects of my professional life in recent years is how much time I spend thinking and writing about magnets. But the “snapping into place” thing does raise the question of why Apple didn&#39;t include magnets in its cases for the 16e. <a href="#fnr2-2025-02-26"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></div> ]]>;</content><title> ★ The iPhone 16e </title></entry><entry><link href="https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=q12025" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/w3p" rel="shorturl"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/02/protect_your_app_with_workos_r_2" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2025:/feeds/sponsors//11.41605</id><author><name> Daring Fireball Department of Commerce</name></author><published> 2025-02-24T22:22:34Z</published><updated> 2025-02-24T22:22:35Z </updated><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
