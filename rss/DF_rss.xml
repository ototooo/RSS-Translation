<p>艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 经常引用的<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/alan-kay-quotes">众多格言</a>之一是“预测未来的最好方法就是发明它。”我认为，由此得出的一个推论是，欣赏新技术的最佳方式就是回到使用旧版本。</p><p>几周前，我步行去费城的约会迟到了。我走路的大多数地方都戴着 AirPods Pro 2，但那天我找不到它们，而且我太晚了，没有时间去寻找。我非常担心整个旅程中我会独自思考，但我的旧第一代 AirPods Pro 放在我的桌子上，而且它们仍然有电量，所以我戴上了它们。</p><p>我记得<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/thoughts_and_observations_on_last_weeks_far_out_apple_event">去年</a>，当我第一次从原来的 AirPods Pro 升级到 AirPods Pro 2 时，我就想，新的听起来至少好一点，而且透明度和主动降噪模式都有很大改进。但回到原来的 AirPods Pro，在城市里散步一下午，确实让我们意识到 AirPods Pro 2 的改进有多大。透明模式和降噪效果<em>更好</em>，更引人注目的是，仅音频质量差异就很明显。作为 AirPods Pro 2 的几乎日常用户一年后，我现在发现第一代的音频质量又薄又尖。我对这种差异感到彻底震惊。</p><p>上周，苹果宣布对 AirPods Pro 2 进行小幅修改。它们现在在外壳上配备了 USB-C 充电端口（而不是 Lightning），并且对修改后型号的耳塞中的 H2 芯片进行了某种升级Vision Pro 耳机明年发货时可提供低延迟无损音频。</p><p>自上周以来，我一直佩戴着一对改进后的 AirPods Pro 2 耳塞，与我用了一年的 iPhone 14 Pro 和其他一些设备配对。显然，我无法评价它们与 Vision Pro 搭配使用时的特殊功能，但就与当前发布的功能相关的所有方面而言，它们比以往任何时候都更好。</p><p>截至今天，所有 AirPods 型号均可进行<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213317">固件更新</a>。对于第二代 AirPods Pro（无论是配备 Lightning 的旧款还是配备 USB-C 的新款），这是一项<em>重大</em>功能更新。调整后的功能包括在打电话或 VoIP 通话期间使用 AirPods 时，通过点击耳塞杆即可将自己静音/取消静音，以及对透明模式和主动降噪模式的改进。但此次更新还带来了两项新功能。</p><p>第一个新功能是对话感知，<a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">苹果对此进行了如下描述</a>：</p><blockquote><p>当您佩戴 AirPods Pro 并需要与附近的人交谈时，对话感知会自动降低正在播放的音量、增强您面前的声音并减少背景噪音。</p></blockquote><p>启用后（所有 AirPods 选项均位于 iOS 或 MacOS 上的“设置”应用程序中），对话感知实际上是完全自动的。如果您正在听音乐或播客，然后开始与某人交谈，或者其他人刚刚开始与您交谈，它就会开始发挥作用。这非常聪明，但您是否会喜欢它很大程度上取决于您的聆听环境。在我 5 天多的测试中，它在一群人中频繁出现，但没有人与我交谈。有时在城市人行道上，有时在杂货店里。在城市环境中，我<em>周围</em>有太多人在说话，而 AirPods 无法知道他们不是<em>在和</em>我说话，因为这个功能总体上不会让人烦恼。但它绝对准确：当我开始说话时，它总是会启动，每次当其他人在我附近说话时，即使他们没有<em>和</em>我说话，我也能分辨出 AirPods 检测到的是谁的声音。将此功能归档为“不适合我个人，但您可能会喜欢它”。</p><p>第二个新功能是新的聆听模式：自适应音频。将自适应音频视为透明和主动降噪 (ANC) 之间的中间点。苹果是这样描述的：</p><blockquote><p>由 H2 驱动的 AirPods Pro 现在具有自适应音频功能，可自动优先处理您在世界各地移动时需要注意的声音。通过在需要时将主动降噪与通透模式无缝融合，自适应音频神奇地为任何环境提供正确的声音组合。</p></blockquote><p>请随意对被描述为“神奇”的技术翻白眼（或翻耳朵），但如果我能想出一个更贴切的形容词就该死了。在我（诚然是短暂的）测试时间内，自适应音频似乎更像是透明模式的下一代、甚至更智能的替代品。当我长按任一 AirPod 杆时，我将其设置为仅在两种模式之间切换：自适应模式和 ANC 模式。如果您愿意，您可以添加常规透明度作为您在之间切换的第三种模式，但我还没有找到一个我想要普通透明度而不是自适应的环境。对于城市行人来说，AirPods Pro 2 的透明度非常好；自适应就更好了。它几乎在任何情况下都会自动执行“Dot I Want™”。我听到交通和路人的声音，但即使是吵闹的卡车和公共汽车经过也不会阻止我清楚地听到我正在听的播客（通常）或歌曲（不太常见）。</p><p>也许我的使用场景正处于自适应音频所擅长的最佳位置 - 与我的使用场景<em>不</em>利于对话意识相反。但从我使用它们的时间来看，我什至不明白为什么自适应音频不能取代透明度。对我来说，到目前为止，它只是透明度，但更好，有更多的即时动态调整。太棒了。 （也许电池寿命是保留普通透明模式的原因之一，但我对过去五天的电池寿命的抱怨为零。）</p><p>如果您已经使用过 AirPods Pro，您就会知道切换模式时会发出可爱的声音。每种模式都有自己独特的音调，透明和主动降噪的音调听起来像是彼此相反的。当你切换它们时，这些音调会暗示你“打开”和“关闭”你周围的世界。自适应音频有一种新的音调，我将其描述为活泼或快乐。这是一种你可以想象儿童电影中仙女的魔杖发出的声音。对于有趣的模式来说，这是一种有趣的声音，我情不自禁地将这种欢乐的声音视为苹果公司的微妙建议，即对于大多数情况下的大多数人来说，这是“最佳”模式，除了明显的情况下，你想要全面沉浸式主动降噪。</p><p> Vision Pro 是苹果首次进军空间计算领域。但 Vision Pro<em>并不是</em>苹果在增强现实领域的第一款产品：AirPods Pro（目前还有 AirPods Max）才是。我们人类是视觉生物，我们自然倾向于将增强现实视为主要的视觉体验，但 AirPods Pro 为您周围的听觉世界提供了令人愉悦且有用的增强功能。从今天开始，自适应音频将其提升到另一个水平。</p><p>自适应音频仅适用于 AirPods Pro 2，这意味着如果我再次发现自己出于必要而佩戴旧的第一代 AirPods Pro，我只会更加恼火。在这一点上，AirPods Pro 2 比原来的 AirPods Pro 比原来的 AirPods Pro 与原来的非 Pro AirPods 相比要好得多。它们不仅仅是无线耳塞——它们是戴在耳朵里的聪明、强大、令人愉悦的计算机。我将以<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/09/thoughts_and_observations_on_last_weeks_far_out_apple_event">一年前</a>写的关于他们的文章作为结束语：</p><blockquote><p>新款 AirPods Pro 是当今苹果公司的最佳单一体现。不是最重要的产品，不是最复杂的产品，也不是最本质的产品。但这体现了苹果正在努力做的一切。它们简单、有用，并且提供<em>大多数</em>人使用和想要的功能。大多数人都使用耳机。很多人每天都在嘈杂的环境中使用它们。对于任何大型包耳式耳机不切实际的场景，AirPods Pro 是世界上最好的耳机。</p></blockquote> ]]>;</content><title> ★ AirPods Pro 2 现已配备 USB-C 充电盒</title></entry><entry><title>Kolide — Okta 的设备信任</title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1t" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/18/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net，2023：/linked//6.40241</id><published> 2023-09-18T20:21:57Z</published><updated> 2023-09-18T20:21:58Z</updated><author><name>约翰·格鲁伯</name><uri>http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

href="#fn1-2023-09-15">1</a></sup></p><p>但在过去的十年里，整个科技界最盛大的事件是苹果公司每年推出的新款 iPhone。你可能会说这不应该是今年最大的事件，但从媒体报道的角度来看，它客观上确实如此。我不确定我认识的人是否至少不知道苹果公司本周刚刚发布了新款 iPhone。仅此一点就很了不起。这很像超级碗，它通常甚至不是一年中最好的橄榄球比赛，更不用说体育赛事了，但无可否认是最大的。即使不看超级碗的人也知道超级碗何时举行。但即使是超级碗也只是美国的现象——iPhone赛事是全球性的，更像是世界杯或奥运会，但世界杯和奥运会每四年才举办一次。</p><p>就像超级碗吸引了体育新闻界以外的媒体关注一样，iPhone 事件也吸引了科技界以外的媒体报道。亲自参加 iPhone 活动会有一种完全不同且独特的氛围。从媒体参加者的角度来看，这些 iPhone 活动充斥着一种嗡嗡声、一种忙碌感和期待感，最重要的是，一种明显的、难以想象的高风险感弥漫在其中。你可以说这些事件很无聊，因为它们是可以预测的，但苹果需要每一代 iPhone 都成为热门产品，媒体知道这一点，而且媒体总是在寻找一个失误来详细说明，比如天线门的无意义争议早在 2010 年，iPhone 4 就出现了<sup id="fnr2-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-15">。2</a></sup>铁杆体育迷对围绕超级碗的所有非体育方面感到恼火，例如将注意力集中在中场音乐会表演者甚至电视广告上。铁杆科技迷同样对“你去过哪个星球？”感到恼火。我们其他人都知道新 iPhone 的细节将会像去年一样出现。证据 A：本周的主流新闻报道<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+usb-c&amp;iar=news&amp;df=w&amp;ia=news">完全以从 Lightning 到 USB-C 的转换为主导</a>。</p><p>史蒂夫·乔布斯剧院是一个美妙的地方，对我来说，这些 iPhone 活动是令人着迷的体验。 （<a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/CxGiLfSPqOX">我周二拍摄了一段视频</a>，试图捕捉主题演讲后动手区域的布局和体验。）但从“我想知道苹果今天要宣布什么”的意义上来说，它们一点也不有趣。 ”这更像是对苹果<em>如何</em>选择如何构建我们都知道即将发布的公告的浓厚兴趣。将新款 iPhone 的推出与新款 Apple Watch 的推出以及今年更新的 AirPods Pro 结合起来，是完美但乏味的。 <sup id="fnr3-2023-09-15"><a href="#fn3-2023-09-15">3</a></sup></p><p>不过，这又不是科技行业“应该”运作的方式。一切都会结束，最终这个不言而喻的道理将适用于 iPhone，但事实是，十多年来，苹果公司的 9 月 iPhone 活动一直是科技界的超级碗。来自同一家公司的<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">迭代</a>手机设计，年复一年。没有其他事件可以与之相比。您可以将接下来的 10 个事件加在一起（包括 Apple 的事件），并且您不会获得 iPhone 事件的累计电量。尽管 iPhone 事件是可以预见的，但这一点还是存在的。从来没有发生过这样的事情，很可能永远不会再发生，而且很多科技爱好者对此感到不满。</p><p>但不可否认这是事实。苹果有一个公式，而且这个公式仍然有效。</p><h2>环境</h2><p>主题演讲中由奥克塔维亚·斯宾塞饰演的 20 分钟<a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/mother-nature/">“大自然”小品</a>遭到了<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/13/apples-mother-nature-sketch-was-a-complete-dud-and-didnt-belong-in-the-iphone-15-event">广泛</a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/apple-mocked-cringey-sketch-touting-companys-climate-change-efforts-filled-left-wing-tropes">批评</a>。我确实认为它持续得太长了——整个片段（草图加细节）实际上只有 10 分钟长，而不是 20 分钟。但似乎每个人，包括我，都觉得它持续了 20 分钟，这从来都不是一个好兆头。</p><p>但我明白了。</p><p>传达的信息是：当今大多数公司都对其未来的环境影响做出承诺。但苹果不仅仅只是做出承诺。他们在这方面取得了真正伟大的成就。现在你可以购买整块碳中和的 Apple Watch，这可不是开玩笑。苹果公司在其使用的材料、在世界各地运输产品的方式、包装方式、自己发电的方式等方面都做出了巨大的改变。他们想要明确的是，整个领域是公司的最高优先事项之一，真正是其制度道德指南针的一部分，对苹果所做的<em>一切</em>都有影响，而且他们已经取得了伟大的成就。大多数其他公司基本上只是在这些东西上进行绿色清洗。</p><p>但苹果如何证明这一点呢？他们不能只是把丽莎·杰克逊放在那里，然后指责其他公司是企业骗子，尽管它们确实是骗子。喜剧就是答案。喜剧可以让你说出原本无法说的话。<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm">讽刺</a>、戏仿和闹剧都是传达严肃论点的极具欺骗性的有力方式。</p><p>这一段的问题很简单，就是不够有趣。这是一个很棒的概念，但结果还算可以。它需要更多 Tina Fey <em>30 Rock 的</em>节奏——更有趣的笑话和更多的笑话。 （苹果公司是否因为 WGA 对此的罢工而受到阻碍？我不禁想知道是否如此。这个短剧<em>看起来</em>不错——只是文字感觉软弱无力。）</p><p>这一领域的一个里程碑式的变化是苹果公司宣称其产品全部采用皮革制成。不再有 iPhone 皮革保护壳、皮革表带——包括爱马仕的皮革表带。他们利润丰厚的合作关系仍在继续，但仅限于织物和橡胶表带。 （除非你<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/15/hermes-leather-apple-watch-straps">从 Hermès 自己</a>购买 Apple Watch。）Apple 已经用一种名为 FineWoven 的新材料取代了自己的皮革 iPhone 保护壳和表带。我花了一些时间在动手区摆弄新的手机壳和表带，我喜欢 FineWoven 材料。主题演讲仅强调了相对于皮革的道德角度：碳影响和动物权利。但至少对于 iPhone 手机壳来说，我认为 FineWoven 比旧的皮革手机壳要好得多。我个人喜欢漂亮的皮革制品，但我总觉得苹果用来生产 iPhone 保护壳的皮革充其量只是还可以。特别是，我认为它的耐候性不太好，而且我从来都不是 iPhone 保护壳的重度用户，通常我的手机壳都是不带保护壳的。抛开所有道德问题，假装苹果仍在销售皮革 iPhone 保护壳和这些新的 FineWoven 保护壳，我宁愿购买 FineWoven 保护壳。根据我的实践经验，我并不完全相信 FineWoven Apple Watch 表带，但最坏的情况是，它们看起来相当不错。 （苹果的皮革表带比爱马仕的便宜，但也明显不如爱马仕的好。）</p><p>新箱子的预订已经开始到货，<a href="https://www.threads.net/search/?q=finewoven">人们对新材料的反应不一</a>。我很好奇它会随着时间的推移而变得如何，尤其是表带，但我的第一印象是，这是对苹果皮革产品的<em>质量</em>升级，而不仅仅是道德方面的升级。我不认为 FineWoven 材料比优质皮革更好，但我确实认为它比苹果制造的皮革 iPhone 保护壳更好，也许与他们自己以前的皮革表带相当。但它不是的一件事是人造皮革。如果 Jony Ive 还在苹果，他可能会这样描述它：毫无疑问，它是一种面料。</p><h2>普通 iPhone 15</h2><p> iPhone 15（非 Pro 版）似乎正是我们所希望的：实际上，iPhone 14 Pro 没有长焦第三个摄像头。</p><p>这让我对这些颜色吹毛求疵，在我看来，这些颜色平淡无奇，除了黑色之外，它和往常一样，确实是一种非常深的黑色。颜色趋势随季节变化，我可能应该更相信苹果的设计师而不是我自己来保持潮流的领先地位，但是伙计，这个阵容看起来平淡无奇。也许浅色调今年会“流行”，但我非常怀疑今后是否有人会说“还记得 iPhone 15 的颜色有多棒吗？”与我们<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/imac-25th-anniversary">对初代 iMac 的</a>普遍喜爱进行比较和对比。</p><p>今年的新功能：普通版 iPhone 15 采用磨砂玻璃后背；迄今为止，非专业型号是光面的，专业型号是磨砂/哑光的。第一次，Pro 版和<em>非</em>Pro 版 iPhone 的手感非常相似：拉丝金属侧面、磨砂玻璃背面、非常相似的尺寸，以及相似的重量。</p><p> iPhone 15 显示屏更亮，与 15 Pro 型号的显示屏具有相同的对比度和最大亮度。不过，非专业版 iPhone 15 机型缺少：ProMotion 动态刷新率和常亮显示模式。反过来，缺乏常亮显示屏意味着 iOS 17 中的新待机功能对于 Pro 机型来说更加有用。对于非专业版 iPhone 15，“待机”只会显示，直到显示超时并进入睡眠状态；对于 iPhone Pro（包括去年的 14 Pro 型号），待机功能始终处于开启状态。</p><h2> iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p> Pro 型号的颜色选择符合最新趋势：黑色（实际上更像是深灰色）、白色和年度颜色。去年 iPhone 14 Pro 的颜色是紫色。今年是蓝色，而且是漂亮但相当深的蓝色。有趣的是，还有“天然钛”，这并不是真正的天然，而是通过 PVD ​​色调实现的，看起来就像人们<em>认为的</em>钛一样，这为苹果最近对颜色没有太多<em>乐趣的</em>论点增添了更多的依据。自然看起来像。就其本身而言，“天然钛”看起来像中性拉丝金属色调。然而，与白色的 iPhone 15 Pro 放在一起，你可以看到苹果的“天然钛金属”更温暖。它看起来并不全是金色，但有一点点黄色。天然钛合金车型的整体效果是“高级灰色”，有点像经典的<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&amp;q=james+bond+db5&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">阿斯顿·马丁 DB5</a>的氛围。我认为，白色的可以完全被描述为“银色”——色温真正中性，而且看起来更闪亮。 iPhone 15 Pro 上的自然色和白色钛金属都无法与 Apple Watch Ultra 的钛金属机身相匹配，但自然色更接近。</p><p>与后 iPhone-X 时代的所有不锈钢 iPhone 相比，15 Pro 和 Pro Max 的手感要轻<em>得多</em>。假设它们在现实世界的使用中证明是耐用的，那么仅从重量来看，从抛光不锈钢到钛的转变就是一个巨大的胜利。但我也更喜欢它的外观和感觉——略带纹理，而不是高度抛光。我认为我的 iPhone 是一个工具，而不是珠宝；抛光表面似乎不太合适，就像钢质 Apple Watch 那样。</p><p>框架的圆形边缘——这一设计变化也出现在铝制非专业型号中——也是一个胜利。这感觉像是 iPhone X/XS/11 的完全圆形侧面和 iPhone 12/13/14 的平坦锐边侧面之间的最佳中间地带。预计这种外形尺寸也会在三代中保持稳定——苹果是一家模式公司。</p><p>操作按钮看起来很棒。开箱即用，它默认充当静音切换开关，但选择其他操作很容易（并且可以说<a href="https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1702082368905888058">很有趣</a>）。 Built-in actions include: flashlight, launching the Camera app, starting an audio recording in Voice Memos, and Magnifier. But the options literally go infinite when you assign it to execute a Shortcuts workflow.</p><h2> RIP iPhones Mini</h2><p> I wasn&#39;t expecting the iPhone 13 Mini to remain in the lineup, but now it&#39;s official: it&#39;s gone.真丢脸。 It obviously wasn&#39;t popular enough but every single person I know who bought an iPhone 12 Mini or 13 Mini loved it, and dreads the idea of their next iPhone being bigger.</p><h2> AirPods Pro &#39;2.5&#39;</h2><p> If you&#39;re not paying close attention, it&#39;s easy to mistakenly believe that the only change to the AirPods Pro 2 is the connector on the charging case. But the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 are actually different <em>earbuds</em> too, effectively more like a version 2.5 or something. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-upgrades-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-with-usb-c-charging/">From Apple Newsroom</a> :</p><blockquote><p> AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are upgraded with USB‑C charging capabilities, additional dust resistance, and Lossless Audio with Apple Vision Pro. With iOS 17, all AirPods Pro (2nd generation) level up with access to new audio experiences like Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness. [...]</p><p> AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with MagSafe Charging Case (USB‑C) will enable Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency to deliver the perfect true wireless solution with Apple Vision Pro. The H2 chip in the latest AirPods Pro and Apple Vision Pro, combined with a groundbreaking wireless audio protocol, unlocks powerful 20-bit, 48 kHz Lossless Audio with a massive reduction in audio latency.</p></blockquote><p> The change from Lightning to USB-C is obvious. The increased dust-resistance is nice. But the ultra-low latency (single-digit milliseconds, I&#39;m reliably told) lossless audio from Vision Pro is interesting. (And I suspect, will be considered a bit annoying to people who already own AirPods Pro 2 with the Lightning case.)</p><h2> Photography and GPUs</h2><p> On the surface, camera features and GPU specs don&#39;t seem related, but they share one thematic similarity: they&#39;re two areas where Apple is behind the industry state-of-the-art. iPhone cameras aren&#39;t behind the state-of-the-art for <em>phone</em> photography, of course — they&#39;re probably the best, and undeniably among the best. But they&#39;re not the best <em>cameras</em> , period, full stop, in the world. Apple wants them to be, and is pursuing this relentlessly year after year. And while Apple Silicon GPUs are also undeniably market-leading for <em>phones</em> , they&#39;re just as undeniably <em>not</em> market-leading in PCs, where Nvidia reigns supreme. I firmly believe Apple wants to do to Nvidia with GPUs what they did to Intel with CPUs — match or surpass them in pure performance, and utterly blow them away in performance-per-watt.</p><p> On the photography front there were two major new features announced Tuesday. The first is a new generation of portrait photography, where Portrait mode can be applied to an image <em>after</em> it was shot as a regular still image. I&#39;ve wanted this feature ever since Portrait mode debuted. While capturing, you don&#39;t have to do a damn thing. You just frame your photo and hit the shutter. No switching modes. But on-device machine learning will decide on the spot whether Portrait mode can improve the image (which will only happen automatically if the subject is a person, dog, or cat), but you can enable it, disable it, and adjust it to your heart&#39;s content in post.</p><p> The second is the iPhone 15 Pro models&#39; ability to capture spatial video. I had <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111054476354563569">speculated over the summer</a> that it would be cool if Apple could launch this for iPhones this year, and they did it. Clearly the optimal way to <em>watch</em> spatial videos will be with a Vision headset, but the best way to <em>capture</em> them — especially in terms of the old adage that the best camera is the one you have with you — will be with iPhones. I considered it a lock that iPhones would eventually be able to capture spatial video memories, but to me it&#39;s a sign of operational excellence and cross-device collaboration that Apple pulled it off this year, with iPhones that will ship months ahead of the first-generation Vision Pro. (The ability to shoot spatial video using an iPhone 15 Pro isn&#39;t available yet — it&#39;s “coming later this year”. And the hands-on area units didn&#39;t have the feature, nor any example spatial videos preloaded. So the only thing we know about the feature is what was broadcast in the keynote.)</p><p> With regard to the A17 Pro, let&#39;s start with the name. Apple uses “pro” in a lot of different ways for a lot of different products, but one thing they&#39;re pretty consistent about is that “Pro” products are the only ones with “pro” components or features. (Note, for example, that ProMotion dynamic refresh rates are only available in the iPhone Pro, iPad Pro, and MacBook Pro.) So I think Apple has once again tweaked their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/apples_two-pronged_annual_iphone_strategy">two-pronged annual iPhone strategy</a> : I bet next year&#39;s iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will get an A17 SoC, but I will also bet that chip will not be the A17 Pro. Maybe that will be the A17 “Bionic”, maybe just the no-adjective “A17”, but I do not think it will be the A17 Pro that&#39;s shipping in the iPhones 15 Pro.</p><p> What might be different in the non-pro A17 next year? I suspect the GPU might not be as beefy (perhaps, with binning, it will offer 5 cores instead of 6), and I suspect it might have 6 GB of RAM (like the A16 Bionic chips) instead of the 8 GB of RAM in the A17 Pro.</p><p> But my god, what a GPU the A17 Pro seems to have. Hardware-accelerated ray tracing is a huge deal, and a major differentiating factor between Apple&#39;s M-series chips (which don&#39;t have it) and high-end PC GPUs from Nvidia and AMD (which do). Clearly, this new GPU is not just the biggest aspect of the A17 Pro, it&#39;s going to be the biggest aspect of the M3-series chips for Macs and iPads (and, eventually, Vision headsets) too. The A-series chips have always had world-class GPUs for phones, but Apple is attempting to narrow the high-end GPU gap on the PC side as well.</p><p> But when? The A17 Pro is the de facto launch of TSMC&#39;s next-generation 3nm fabrication. Informed speculation suggests that Apple has secured 90-95 percent of TSMC&#39;s 3nm output for the next year, and it sounds like TSMC&#39;s production might not be able to keep up with iPhone 15 Pro demand — the 15 Pro models might wind up backordered for months to come. That&#39;s an aspect of Apple&#39;s two-pronged annual iPhone strategy <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/apples_two-pronged_annual_iphone_strategy">I didn&#39;t mention last week</a> . I don&#39;t think it would have even been possible for the non-pro iPhone 15 models to use the A17 chip because they&#39;re going to have trouble enough producing them for the Pro models alone.</p><p> So based solely on TSMC&#39;s 3nm production capability, I don&#39;t expect to see M3 Macs or iPads this year, and perhaps not until midway through <em>next</em> year. Keep in mind too that the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air just launched three months ago. That to me was a sign that the M2 would remain “current” until at least next year. People hoping for new M3 MacBook Airs this year are setting themselves up for disappointment, I think.</p><p> It speaks to the iPhone&#39;s preeminence in Apple&#39;s product lineup — a preeminence based, reasonably, on profound popularity and profitability — that it gets the most cutting-edge silicon long before any other product.</p><h2> Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2</h2><p> The Series 9 watches continue to have their series number etched on the caseback. But the new Ultra doesn&#39;t say “2” on it anywhere. It&#39;s just the new Ultra. I <em>think</em> it&#39;s indistinguishable from last year&#39;s original Apple Watch Ultra on the outside — you&#39;ll need to power the watch on and check in Settings → General → About to tell whether an Ultra is from the first or second generation. Apple almost never labels its products with generation numbers or model years on the outside. But this seems like an inconsistent way to treat the two different lines of Apple Watches. It&#39;s almost enough to make you think that when the Series Apple Watches launched, there was an influential executive who thought numbering them was a good idea, and that executive is no longer at Apple.</p><p> The best new feature in Apple Watch this year has to be the new double tap gesture, enabling no-touch manipulation of the watch. We got to try this in the hands-on area, and it Just Worked™. Fast, accurate, and natural. In the keynote and their marketing materials, Apple says you need to tap your thumb and index finger, but I tried with my thumb and middle finger and it worked just fine. No more touching your nose to your watch when your hands are dirty from food preparation or carrying something you can&#39;t set down. And the double tap gesture parallels the main gesture that will be used to navigate VisionOS. (One question that occurs to me now: What happens when you&#39;re using a Vision Pro while wearing an Apple Watch, and you double tap with your watch hand? Does the gesture apply to both devices? Or do they somehow negotiate with each other and determine which one acts on it? Apple devices already negotiate like this when you utter “Hey Siri” within earshot of multiple devices — I suspect that when using a Vision Pro while wearing a new Apple Watch, the headset will get first crack at a double tap gesture.)</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-15"><p> It&#39;s almost certainly true that 2023 will be remembered as the year that AI broke through, and that ChatGPT in particular is the “tech product” of the year.

Two of its biggest challengers, Samsung and Huawei, have stumbled in recent years. Samsung faltered in 2016 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/international/samsung-galaxy-note7-terminated.html">the batteries in its flagship smartphone spontaneously combusted</a> . Huawei, which was popular in China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html">floundered in 2020</a> after the Trump administration blocked it from buying US technology.</p></blockquote><p> Huawei&#39;s geopolitical travails are another matter, but it seems downright silly to attribute even an iota of the iPhone&#39;s popularity in 2023 to one disastrous Samsung model seven years ago — especially given that Samsung has never put all its “flagship phone” eggs in one basket. But imagine now if that had been the iPhone 7 with the exploding batteries and that was ultimately recalled from the market. The news media is drawn to “ <em>Look how the mighty have fallen</em> ” story narratives like moths to an open flame. If it <em>had</em> been the iPhone 7 instead of the Galaxy Note 7 whose batteries combusted, we&#39;d still be hearing about it in every article about today&#39;s iPhones. Nothing like that has happened with an Apple product since the PowerBook 5300 back in 1995, but that doesn&#39;t mean it <em>can&#39;t</em> happen. The pressure to avoid such a debacle with every single battery and power adapter Apple manufactures is intense.

<p>I came away from Tuesday&#39;s keynote with the impression that, like Apple, Hermès would no longer be making leather Apple Watch straps. But that&#39;s not the case. Apple itself is <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-hermes/">only selling Hermès watches with fabric and rubber straps</a> , but Hermès itself still has 21 leather straps for the Series 9 Hermès watches. Apple&#39;s keynote seemed so adamant about nixing leather that I suspect there are fans of the Hermès leather straps who are disappointed, thinking they&#39;re no longer being produced. But I can see why Apple decided against mentioning it.

<p>There were rampant rumors pre-event that Apple was going to raise the prices for the iPhone Pro models this year, but they didn&#39;t. They did, however, eliminate the 128 GB $1099 iPhone Max model. There&#39;s a 128 GB iPhone 15 Pro for $999, but the entry model Max has 256 GB of storage and costs $1199. That&#39;s $100 higher than last year&#39;s 128 GB 14 Pro Max, but the same price as last year&#39;s 256 GB 14 Pro Max. Turns out, inflation adjusted, this year&#39;s prices are <em>lower</em> , not higher.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inflation-Adjusted iPhone Pricing’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/13/inflation-adjusted-iphone-pricing">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Dithering </title><link href="https://dithering.fm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1i" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/13/dithering" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40230</id><published> 2023-09-13T21:50:19Z</published><updated> 2023-09-13T21:52:53Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>It seems like every company is scrambling to stake their claim in the AI goldrush — check out the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/the-ceo-of-kroger-mentioned-ai-8-times-on-the-company-s-earnings-call#xj4y7vzkg">CEO of Kroger promising</a> to bring LLMs into the dairy aisle. And front line workers are following suit–experimenting with AI so they can work faster and do more.</p><p> In the few short months since ChatGPT debuted, hundreds of AI-powered tools have come on the market. But while AI-based tools have genuinely helpful applications, they also pose profound security risks. Unfortunately, most companies still haven&#39;t come up with policies to manage those risks. In the absence of clear guidance around responsible AI use, employees are blithely handing over sensitive data to untrustworthy tools.</p><p> <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">AI-based browser extensions</a> offer the clearest illustration of this phenomenon. The Chrome store is overflowing with extensions that (claim to) harness ChatGPT to do all manner of tasks: punching up emails, designing graphics, transcribing meetings, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3pAqxtw">and writing code</a> . But these tools are prone to at least three types of risk.</p><ol><li> <strong>Malware:</strong> Security researchers keep uncovering <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/beware-ai-scams-meta-blocks-1000-plus-links-tied-to-chatgpt-themed-malware">AI-based extensions</a> that steal user data. These extensions play on users&#39; trust of the big tech platforms (“it can&#39;t be dangerous if Google lets it on the Chrome store!”) and they often appear to work, by hooking up to ChatGPT et al&#39;s APIs.</li><li> <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Companies including Apple and Verizon have banned their employees from using LLMs because these products rarely offer a guarantee that a user&#39;s inputs won&#39;t be used as training data.</li><li> <strong>Prompt Injection Attacks:</strong> In this little known but <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3rmEhIP">potentially unsolvable attack</a> , hidden text on a webpage directs an AI tool to perform malicious actions–such as exfiltrate data and then delete the records.</li></ol><p> Up until now, most companies have been caught flat-footed by AI, but these risks are too serious to ignore.</p><p> At Kolide, we&#39;re taking a two-part approach to governing AI use.</p><ol><li> <strong>Draft AI policies as a team.</strong> We don&#39;t want to totally ban our team from using AI, we just want to use it safely. So our first step is meeting with representatives from multiple teams to figure out what they&#39;re getting out of AI-based tools, and how we can provide them with secure options that don&#39;t expose critical data or infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>Use Kolide to block malicious tools.</strong> Kolide lets IT and security teams write <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3PJW32Q">Checks that detect device compliance issues</a> , and we&#39;ve already started creating Checks for malicious (or dubious) AI-based tools. Now if an employee accidentally downloads malware, they&#39;ll be prevented from logging into our cloud apps until they&#39;ve removed it.</li></ol><p> Every company will have to craft policies based on their unique needs and concerns, but the important thing is to start now. There&#39;s still time to seize the reins of AI, before it gallops away with your company&#39;s data.</p><p> To learn more about how Kolide enforces device compliance for companies with Okta, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball">click here to watch an on-demand demo</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Kolide — Device Trust for Okta.

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">the iPhone X</a> marked an obvious inflection point in iPhone history: the switch from the original home-button system interface, with Touch ID, to the “all-screen” interface with Face ID. But it also marked a widely misunderstood/under-appreciated (although, it pains me to point out, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/iphone_x_one_year">not by all</a> ) change in Apple&#39;s annual iPhone hardware strategy. Instead of introducing just one new iPhone, in 2017 Apple began introducing <em>two</em> entirely different tiers of new iPhone each year. One “pro”, one “regular”: </p><!-- Markdown table

The real difference has been between the pro and non-pro models. Apple didn&#39;t start naming iPhones “Pro” until the iPhones 11 in 2019, but effectively, they started this “pro” tier with the X in 2017.</p><p> What everyone groks about this strategy is that the pro models are more expensive. Of course they are. But there are a few aspects to Apple&#39;s strategy that many people miss. The most important is that the iPhone Pro models are only produced for one year. If the pattern holds, come next week, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will cease production, and be <em>replaced</em> in the product line by the new 15 Pro models. The non-pro iPhones, however, stay in production for at least two additional years, dropping in price by $100 each year. I find that fascinating, but it&#39;s seldom remarked upon. The iPhones that are the most expensive, most cutting-edge, and I presume the hardest to manufacture are only produced for one single year. That&#39;s an altogether new strategy from the years before the iPhone X, when there was just one new flagship iPhone per year (albeit in two sizes during the iPhone 6-6S-7 years), and most iPhones stayed in the lineup at reduced prices for years to come.</p><p> So while there have been reports that last year&#39;s iPhone 14 Plus hasn&#39;t sold particularly well, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a failure, or even that Apple expected it to sell all that well <em>this</em> past year. To me, the workhorse years for non-pro iPhones are years two and three in the lineup, when they come down in price. People shopping for less expensive iPhones but who want a big-ass screen have never had an option before: the now-year-old iPhone 14 Plus will be that.</p><p> One much-noted change last year is that the non-pro iPhone 14 models remained on the A15 chip from 2021. One less-noted change is that internally, the iPhone 14 is very different from the iPhone 13, despite the fact that both use the same A15 chip. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">iFixit describes the iPhone 14</a> — the non-pro models — as the most repairable iPhones Apple has ever made. The chip remained the same but the internal design was altogether different, and better. The iPhone 14 is a design that was meant to remain in production for years to come.</p><p> We won&#39;t know tomorrow whether this more repairable, more accessible system architecture will repeat with the iPhone 15, but I suspect it will. No matter what, the regular iPhone 15 models will not simply be the iPhones 14 Pro models repackaged in aluminum frames rather than stainless steel. The strategy Apple has achieved, as I see it:</p><ul><li> Pro models: cutting-edge chips, cameras, and materials; will be produced for just one year.</li><li> Non-pro models: refined architecture using the year-old SoC and older camera systems; will be produced for 2-3 years <em>after</em> their launch year.</li></ul><p> The iPhones Pro are far more exciting, but the non-pro iPhones are essential to the lineup and thus to the entire iPhone ecosystem. In sports terms, the Pro models are the offense, and the non-pro models are the defense. The offense gets the glory, but it&#39;s defense, <a href="https://theconversation.com/does-defense-actually-win-championships-89628">they say</a> , that wins championships.</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ Apple&#39;s Two-Pronged Annual iPhone Strategy</title></entry><entry><title> At Least the Word &#39;Maniacal&#39; Fits </title><link href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/09/11/elon-musk-moved-twitter-servers-himself-in-the-night-new-biography-details-his-maniacal-sense-of-urgency.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1f" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40227</id><published> 2023-09-12T00:47:41Z</published><updated> 2023-09-12T00:47:43Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>CNBC has another excerpt from Walter Isaacson&#39;s <em>Elon Musk</em> , this one telling the tale of Musk and his cousins moving thousands of servers from a data center in Sacramento to another in Portland:</p><blockquote><p> “You&#39;ll have to hire a contractor to lift the floor panels,” Alex said. “They need to be lifted with suction cups.” Another set of contractors, he said, would then have to go underneath the floor panels and disconnect the electric cables and seismic rods.</p><p> Musk turned to his security guard and asked to borrow his pocket knife. Using it, he was able to lift one of the air vents in the floor, which allowed him to pry open the floor panels. He then crawled under the server floor himself, used the knife to jimmy open an electrical cabinet, pulled the server plugs, and waited to see what happened. Nothing exploded. The server was ready to be moved.</p><p> “Well that doesn&#39;t seem super hard,” he said as Alex the Uzbek and the rest of the gang stared. Musk was totally jazzed by this point. It was, he said with a loud laugh, like a remake of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> , Sacramento edition.</p></blockquote><p> It&#39;s all a bunch of yucks until it turns to yikes:</p><blockquote><p> The servers had user data on them, and James did not initially realize that, for privacy reasons, they were supposed to be wiped clean before being moved. “By the time we learned this, the servers had already been unplugged and rolled out, so there was no way we would roll them back, plug them in, and then wipe them,” he says. Plus, the wiping software wasn&#39;t working. “Fuck, what do we do?”他问。 Elon recommended that they lock the trucks and track them.</p><p> So James sent someone to Home Depot to buy big padlocks, and they sent the combination codes on a spreadsheet to Portland so the trucks could be opened there. “I can&#39;t believe it worked,” James says. “They all made it to Portland safely.”</p></blockquote><p> A profound sense of urgency is beneficial to a leader, up to a point. Despite CNBC&#39;s framing, Musk clearly goes way past that point. This entire endeavor was absurdly and unnecessarily reckless. In addition to the privacy violations, yanking these servers out of Sacramento, against the direct advice of Twitter&#39;s infrastructure team, directly led to months of instability for users.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘At Least the Word ‘Maniacal’ Fits’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Qualcomm Announces Renewed Deal With Apple for 5G Modems </title><link href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v1e" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40226</id><published> 2023-09-11T15:54:05Z</published><updated> 2023-09-11T20:10:27Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ian King and Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p><blockquote><p> Apple Inc. is extending an agreement to get modem semiconductors from Qualcomm Inc. for three more years, a sign that its ambitious effort to design the chips in-house is taking longer than expected. Qualcomm shares surged on the news.</p><p> The new pact will cover “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026,” Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies&#39; agreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone — due on Tuesday — was expected to be one of the last to rely on the Qualcomm modem chip. […]</p><p> “This agreement reinforces Qualcomm&#39;s track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products,” the San Diego-based chipmaker said. Though the financial terms of the new deal weren&#39;t disclosed, Qualcomm said it was similar to the previous arrangement signed in 2019.</p></blockquote><p> Funny how they announced this today, and even funnier that there&#39;s no quote from anyone at Apple. Qualcomm, seemingly, has Apple over the barrel on these 5G modems.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> Keep in mind that Apple has been trying to build its own 5G modems for years now. Back in 2019 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/25/apple-intel">they bought Intel&#39;s modem business</a> — the same year <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">they settled (effectively, losing) a lawsuit with Qualcomm</a> . And then there was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/11/qualcomm-is-harassing-apple/">this story over the summer</a> , where Apple accused Qualcomm of harassing Apple executives by subpoenaing them for a lawsuit filed by the FTC.

<p>Yoko Kubota, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-bans-iphone-use-for-government-officials-at-work-635fe2f8">reporting from Beijing for The Wall Street Journal</a> Wednesday ( <a href="https://apple.news/A01gybx6UQReBj5eQUppe8g">News+ link</a> ):</p><blockquote><p> China ordered officials at central government agencies not to use Apple&#39;s iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p> In recent weeks, staff were given the instructions by their superiors in workplace chat groups or meetings, the people said. The directive is the latest step in Beijing&#39;s campaign to cut reliance on foreign technology and enhance cybersecurity, and comes as China seeks to limit flows of sensitive information outside of China&#39;s borders. The move by Beijing could have a chilling effect for foreign brands in China, including Apple. Apple dominates the high-end smartphone market in the country and counts China as one of its biggest markets, relying on it for about 19% of its overall revenue.</p></blockquote><p> Jenny Leonard and Debby Wu, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/china-plans-to-expand-iphone-ban-to-some-state-backed-firms-in-blow-to-apple">reporting for Bloomberg</a> <sup id="fnr1-2023-09-10"><a href="#fn1-2023-09-10">1</a></sup> Thursday:</p><blockquote><p> China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.</p><p> Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-06/china-bans-iphone-use-at-central-government-agencies-wsj-says">report</a> from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.</p></blockquote><p> [ <strong>Inside Baseball Interpolation:</strong> I have often mentioned here that Bloomberg, as a news organization, is uniquely fanatical about scoops — being the first to break news, and in particular, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/apple_gpt_bloomberg">market-moving news</a> . And they expect credit for their scoops when the news is re-reported elsewhere. So trust me, it pains them to credit the Journal for this scoop. But here&#39;s where the Bloomberg institutional dickheadedness is revealed: check out the link for the word “report” in the blockquote above. <em>Hint:</em> It doesn&#39;t link to, you know, the Wall Street Journal story that broke the news.]</p><blockquote><p> If Beijing goes ahead, the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing&#39;s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry.</p></blockquote><p> This gets to the nut of my intense curiosity regarding this edict. How much of it is nationalism — the CCP turning up the dial on the inherently jingoist mindset of a police state — and how much of it, if any, is about the fact that iPhones are secure, and their security is outside the reach of the CCP? The Chinese government surely wants to surveil what government employees do on their phones, and iPhones make that harder.</p><p> Lastly, where does Apple&#39;s unique relationship with the Chinese government play into this? Apple remains dependent upon China for manufacturing, the iPhone in particular. They <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/india-expected-to-assemble-1-in-10-iphone-15-models-in-2023/">make some iPhones elsewhere</a> , but the overwhelming majority are assembled in China, and there&#39;s no other supply chain on earth that can replace it today. That&#39;s a terrible starting point for any negotiation. But: China gets a lot from Apple. Over the course of my lifetime, China has been fighting to change the perception of what “Made in China” stands for. It&#39;s always meant cheap. It used to also imply shoddy. Apple is the feather in China&#39;s cap. iPhones aren&#39;t just the nicest phones in the world — they&#39;re arguably the nicest and most complex mass-produced consumer products in any category. And they are made almost exclusively in China.</p><p> The Chinese government surely bristles at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-is-huaweis-new-smartphone-generating-so-much-buzz-2023-09-01/">the pariah status of Huawei globally</a> , but there&#39;s no plausible scenario where any Chinese company achieves the sort of prestige Apple has. Huawei phones, at <em>best</em> , are third-rate, and everyone knows it, including everyone in China. <sup id="fnr2-2023-09-10"><a href="#fn2-2023-09-10">2</a></sup> If China maintains its symbiotic relationship with Apple, China will remain firmly associated with the most prestigious technology brand in the world. If not, and Apple migrates its primary manufacturing elsewhere, China again drops to being associated only with second- and third-rate products. Even worse, the best company — in that scenario — would have chosen to part with China. China gains enormous prestige from Apple; Apple takes a reputational <em>hit</em> from its reliance upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre">brutal</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/crackdown-in-xinjiang">human-rights-violating</a> communist dictatorship.</p><p> Perhaps China feels free to antagonize Apple out of the belief that Apple <em>cannot</em> eliminate its dependence upon Chinese manufacturing. But even if that&#39;s true, the message to other companies (say, carmakers) eyeing a move to Chinese assembly would be this: once you grow dependent upon China we&#39;ll screw you like we screwed Apple. China&#39;s intended message to the world isn&#39;t merely that they&#39;re the most capable nation for manufacturing, it&#39;s that they&#39;re also a trustworthy and dependable partner.</p><p> This sandbagging of Apple regarding iPhone usage by government employees says the opposite: that China cannot be trusted as a partner.</p><p> So here&#39;s how I tally the detente. If Apple can ease away from its dependence upon China for manufacturing, they <em>might</em> . But the risk is that doing so will upset the Xi Jinping regime and Apple will suffer in consumer product sales within China. (Perhaps that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing now?)</p><p> If Apple does ease away from China, though, who can China replace them with? Who could they tout as a world-class technology company that relies upon China for manufacturing? Second place is so far behind Apple you can&#39;t see it.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-09-10"><p> Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published “ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack">The Big Hack</a> ” in October 2018 — a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China&#39;s intelligence services.

A larger battery does not mean longer battery life. And most ridiculously, “higher-resolution cameras” not only doesn&#39;t mean “better cameras”, there are like zero people on the planet, including Joe Huawei himself, who believes any Huawei phone has cameras that are competitive with those in iPhones. “Resolution” is the last refuge of camera scoundrels. For Chinese consumers Huawei offers two things over an iPhone: it&#39;s a Chinese company, and the phones are cheaper. Apple should worry about the Chinese government.

<p>Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p> The Indiana Pi Bill is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the Indiana General Assembly, one of the most notorious attempts to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, although it does imply various incorrect values of the mathematical constant π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by a physician who was an amateur mathematician, never became law due to the intervention of Prof. CA Waldo of Purdue University, who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210515024706/http://www.math.purdue.edu/people/bio/egoins/Indiana%20Pi%20Bill.html">Here&#39;s a good summary</a> (from modern day Purdue professor Edray Goins) of how this kook Edwin Goodwin arrived at π = 3.2.</p><p> I was reminded of this laughable legislation <sup>*</sup> by a friend commenting on the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/uk-encryption-win">UK abandoning its foolhardy attempt</a> to mandate the inspection of impossible-to-inspect end-to-end messaging. E2EE communication cannot be “scanned” for child pornography while remaining secure for all other purposes, but it would be nice if it could. Pi is not 3.2 and a circle cannot be squared, but it would nice if it were so. The UK&#39;s legislation is every bit as much ignorant wishful thinking as Indiana&#39;s was over a century ago.</p><p> That Indiana bill was not defeated, however — it was apparently merely shelved. The UK, likewise, has not repealed the law granting them the power to effectively ban end-to-end encryption — they&#39;ve merely declared that they will not use it — yet. That&#39;s dangerous. This law should be rescinded, not ignored.</p><p> <small>* <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/mode/1up">From Waldo&#39;s own account of the saga</a> comes this gem of a quote (written in the third person), regarding an offer to be introduced to Goodwin: “A member then showed the writer a copy of the bill just passed and asked him if he would like an introduction to the learned doctor, its author. He declined the courtesy with thanks remarking that he was acquainted with as many crazy people as he cared to know.”</small><p> Amen, Dr. Waldo.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘The Indiana Pi Bill’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/indiana-pi-bill">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Twitter/X&#39;s Descent Into an Antisemitic Cesspool </title><link href="https://twitter.com/David_Leavitt/status/1699494318078136786" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v19" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/twitter-antisemetic-cesspool" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40221</id><published> 2023-09-06T23:29:17Z</published><updated> 2023-09-07T06:01:53Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>Lane Brown, writing for Vulture:</p><blockquote><p> But despite Rotten Tomatoes&#39;s reputed importance, it&#39;s worth a reminder: Its math stinks. Scores are calculated by classifying each review as either positive or negative and then dividing the number of positives by the total. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about">That&#39;s the whole formula</a> . Every review carries the same weight whether it runs in a major newspaper or a Substack with a dozen subscribers.</p><p> If a review straddles positive and negative, too bad. “I read some reviews of my own films where the writer might say that he doesn&#39;t think that I pull something off, but, boy, is it interesting in the way that I don&#39;t pull it off,” says Schrader, a former critic. “To me, that&#39;s a good review, but it would count as negative on Rotten Tomatoes.” [...]</p><p> Another problem — and where the trickery often begins — is that Rotten Tomatoes scores are posted after a movie receives only a handful of reviews, sometimes as few as five, even if those reviews may be an unrepresentative sample. This is sort of like a cable-news network declaring an Election Night winner after a single county reports its results. But studios see it as a feature, since, with a little elbow grease, they can sometimes fool people into believing a movie is better than it is.</p></blockquote><p> Brown also uncovers implicit payola, with a Hollywood PR firm paying small-time critics tracked by Rotten Tomatoes $50 (fifty measly bucks!) for positive reviews. My whole family has been growing ever more skeptical of Rotten Tomatoes scores for years, but we reached a breaking point earlier this year when we rented <em>M3gan</em> , which we all found to be a shitty movie, but <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan">scored a 93 from Rotten Tomatoes</a> .

End-to-end encryption&#39;s meaning is right there in its name. There&#39;s no dial that can be adjusted from “weak” to “strong”. There&#39;s no option for content inspection between end points.

<p>Horace Dediu, writing at the newly refreshed Asymco:</p><blockquote><p> So the picture becomes clearer. The iPhone customer is <em>7.4 times</em> more valuable than the Android customer. This is more impressive than the 4× rule I had 10 years ago. The reasons are mainly that my anecdotes were from developers who sold products in the US or EU whereas expansion of smartphones to 7 billion global users has drawn in more lower spending customers.</p><p> But Apple&#39;s base has also grown to over 1 billion users (650 million store users). This highlights that Apple has effectively grown <em>and</em> discriminated customers effectively. It obtained not just 1 billion customers but <em>the best</em> 1 billion customers.</p><p> How to discriminate effectively is the holy grail of marketing. The naïve approach is to keep prices high. But that usually only results in a “luxury” branding and a small base that tends not to grow. The alternative “premium” approach is to offer functionality and multiple tiers and distribution options and financing and merchandising. There is no simple formula.</p></blockquote><p> I really enjoyed this piece, but I will quibble with “There is no simple formula”. It&#39;s the <em>execution</em> that is difficult and complex. But at a high level the formula Apple has applied to make the iPhone (and iPad) the unprecedented success that they are is remarkably simple.</p><p> First, make something people care deeply about. Computers are the biggest advance in human society since the industrial revolution; <em>revolution</em> is a strong word but it applied then and applies again today. People care about their computers and what they do on their computers very much, and they care most about the most personal of personal computers: their phones. They use them for communication, photography, entertainment (music and video), games, and more. They carry them almost everywhere they go, all day every day, and sleep next to them.</p><p> Second, make the best version of that thing people care deeply about. The people who care the most will perceive the superiority of your product, and gladly — not begrudgingly — pay a premium for it.</p><p> Third, keep iterating, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">tirelessly and continuously</a> , to improve that product year after year. Focus on aspects that cannot be copied or imitated. In the iPhone&#39;s case, those are things such as custom chips, superior hardware components and manufacturing techniques, software frameworks <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-deep-history-of-your-apps-steve-jobs-nextstep-and-early-object-oriented-programming/">decades</a> in the making, a culture that prioritizes great design, and an ever-expanding ecosystem that keeps customers in the flock <em>by making them happy</em> . Build a luxury resort they don&#39;t want to leave, not a prison they can&#39;t leave.</p><p> Don&#39;t prioritize being first or being cheapest. Prioritize being the best. That&#39;s a simple strategy. It&#39;s the execution that&#39;s hard as hell.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Horace Dediu: ‘The Value of a Customer’’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/dediu-value-of-a-customer">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Should Apple Cease Advertising on Twitter? </title><link href="https://technovia.co.uk/2023/09/04/its-long-past.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v13" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40215</id><published> 2023-09-05T20:39:37Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T20:39:38Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Ian Betteridge:</p><blockquote><p> Apple is very good at taking a stand when it&#39;s easy. It refused to carry various small right-wing social platforms on its App Store, because the content moderation policies weren&#39;t up to scratch. Meanwhile, Twitter gets a pass despite having no practical control over hate speech and an owner who actively encourages it.</p><p> Should we be considering boycotting Apple and other companies that advertise on Twitter? Let&#39;s frame that another way: if you found out that a company was actively funding hate speech, would you want to buy products from them?</p><p> I know I wouldn&#39;t.</p></blockquote><p> Betteridge is without question correct that Apple is in a difficult position here. If you think it would be easy, recall last year, when Apple had drawn Musk&#39;s ire over the App Store&#39;s policies. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/30/cook-musk-apple-park">As I wrote then</a> , “Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.”</p><p> But it&#39;s hard to imagine any other ad venue — website, billboard, magazine, TV channel — where Apple would run ads that run alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/k_pendergrast/status/1697385443040653479">ads like this one</a> . No need for a statement. Just cease running ads on Twitter/X, and stop paying for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/29/hashmoji-iphone-15-apple-event/">these promotional “hashflags”</a> . When inevitably asked why, respond how Apple responds best: no comment.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Should Apple Cease Advertising on Twitter?’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Little Musk Who Cries &#39;Wolf&#39; Daily Now Claims Twitter/X Is Going to Sue the Anti-Defamation League </title><link href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/04/elon-musk-to-sue-adl-for-falsely-accusing-him-x-of-antisemitism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v12" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40214</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:51:58Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T02:00:12Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Rebecca Bellan, reporting for TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p> In the newest uproar you might have missed, Elon Musk says X, formerly Twitter, will file a defamation lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League. Musk accused the ADL, an organization that works to combat antisemitism, extremism and bigotry, of falsely accusing him and X of being antisemitic.</p><p> “To clear our platform&#39;s name on the matter of anti-Semitism, it looks like we have no choice but to file a defamation lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League … oh the irony!” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698828606598734225">tweeted</a> the billionaire celebrity on Monday.</p><p> Musk also blamed the ADL for X&#39;s falling US advertising revenue. “Our US advertising revenue is still down 60%, primarily due to pressure on advertisers by @ADL (that&#39;s what advertisers tell us), so they almost succeeded in killing X/Twitter!” <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1698755938541330907">said Musk</a> .</p><p> Musk started off this latest tirade by claiming to be pro-free speech, but “against anti-Semitism of any kind.”</p></blockquote><p> Musk claims he&#39;s going to do all sorts of crazy shit. Sometimes he actually goes through with it, like the time he said he was going to buy Twitter and take it private. Most of the time, though, he doesn&#39;t. We need to stop reporting on what he says and focus mostly on what he does. Just two weeks ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/musk-who-cried-wolf">I began using this headline play on the proverbial Little Boy Who Cried Wolf</a> when Musk declared that Twitter/X was going to get rid of the block feature. He might still go through with that threat, but it hasn&#39;t happened, and I suspect it won&#39;t.</p><p> So why am I even linking to this threat against the ADL? Because what has already happened is odious and noteworthy. A weekend-long trending “BanTheADL” hashtag that not only wasn&#39;t suppressed, but was bolstered by Musk himself. Now this “ <em>It&#39;s all the Jews&#39; fault</em> ” excuse in the form of the lawsuit threat — it doesn&#39;t really matter if Musk follows through and sues (it&#39;d be a nonsensical suit), the damage is that Twitter&#39;s most popular user — who happens to own it — is openly courting antisemites.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Little Musk Who Cries ‘Wolf’ Daily Now Claims Twitter/X Is Going to Sue the Anti-Defamation League’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/musk-adl-nonsense">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;The MacOS App Icon Book&#39; by Michael Flarup </title><link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flarup/the-macos-app-icon-book" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v11" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40213</id><published> 2023-09-05T19:06:46Z</published><updated> 2023-09-05T19:06:47Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Speaking of Kickstarter projects, Michael Flarup is working on a sequel to his outstanding <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> — this one dedicated to Mac app icons. Given my interests, I&#39;d have been delighted by <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> even if it had merely been pretty good. But it&#39;s a splendid book — carefully curated, exquisitely well-designed, and very nicely printed and bound. It&#39;s no small trick to reproduce icons meant for screens in a printed book. <em>The iOS App Icon Book</em> is also very well-written and considered, particularly regarding the seminal design shift introduced by iOS 7 in 2013.</p><p> So a sibling volume dedicated to Mac app icons?当然好。</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘‘The MacOS App Icon Book’ by Michael Flarup’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/macos-app-icon-book">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Studio Neat&#39;s Keen: The World&#39;s Best Box Cutter </title><link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/keen-a-compact-durable-and-retractable-utility-knife" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v10" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/studio-neat-keen" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40212</id><published> 2023-09-05T17:39:10Z</published><updated> 2023-09-06T02:02:38Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>New from the dynamic duo at Studio Neat: Keen, a $95 box cutter.</p><p> Yes, a box cutter/utility knife that costs about $100. A $100 tool to replace the sort of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lnchett-12-Pack-Retractable-Cardboard-Mechanism/dp/B07DXTP9M9/?tag=df-amzn-20">disposable thing</a> that costs like a $1 a pop. Until about a year ago, those disposable plastic jobbies were what I used, and I kept losing them. About a year ago, after losing track of the last one in my office, it occurred to me that I lose them because I don&#39;t care about them. I already owned a nice keychain-sized pocket knife from The James Brand, which I love, so I bought <a href="https://thejamesbrand.com/products/the-palmer">the Palmer</a> , their $59 box cutter. 11 months later and I haven&#39;t misplaced it once. And I&#39;m happier for owning it: it&#39;s way nicer to use than any disposable I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p> A few weeks ago, though, my pals at Studio Neat sent me a pre-production Keen. I prefer it to the Palmer in every single regard. First, it&#39;s thinner and smaller, but in no way <em>too</em> small. Second, it&#39;s easier to change the blade. But most importantly, the Keen offers a completely original design for opening and closing the blade: a spring-loaded slider. It&#39;s so different from any box cutter design I&#39;ve ever seen that I wondered if I&#39;d even like it at all, let alone prefer it, because it does not lock into place. Turns out though I <em>much</em> prefer it. It feels both more convenient and safer, because it&#39;s impossible to leave the blade extended while you aren&#39;t holding it. And when released, it springs back so quickly that if you drop it, the blade will retract by the time it lands.</p><p> Pens are so cheap you can get them free at most bank counters, but many people who care spend more to get a really nice one. (Studio Neat, in fact, has you covered there as well, if you&#39;re interested, with their <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone">Mark One</a> and <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/marktwo">Mark Two</a> . Me personally, I remain devoted to the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Clip-Gel-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/6387">$1.75 Zebra Sarasa</a> .) A box cutter is no different. Given how many packages I receive each and every week of the year, it&#39;s one of my most-used tools. So why not buy the best? The Kickstarter is already fully-funded, but the eventual retail price will be around $25 higher than the Kickstarter price.</p><p> See also:</p><ul><li><p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5bFsyRSTp4">Chase Reeves made a fun little YouTube video about the Keen</a> .</p></li><li><p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C3J93DWH/?tag=df-amzn-20">These ceramic utility razor blades</a> are sharper than steel ones, supposedly last longer, and work especially well with the Keen in that they aren&#39;t attracted by the Keen&#39;s magnetic closure.</p></li></ul><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Studio Neat’s Keen: The World’s Best Box Cutter’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/studio-neat-keen">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Jigx </title><link href="https://www.jigx.com?utm_source=fireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0x" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/jigx" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40209</id><published> 2023-09-03T23:28:19Z</published><updated> 2023-09-03T23:28:19Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p>The Iconfactory:</p><blockquote><p> All of us here at the Iconfactory love the classic video games we played in our youth. Many hours were spent in front of titles like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol">Moon Patrol</a> , and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)">Battlezone</a> , as well as cherished handheld electronic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/N14UCRZsN3U?si=ewAgv7QK9J9RWeD_">Mattel Football</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/NI4yTsvauTs?si=S7RtQUvxLD2FVEUG">Simon</a> , and <a href="https://youtu.be/m-OkKHxH1xo?si=Voc2r1s8taEHx_v7">Merlin</a> . Ollie&#39;s Arcade recaptures a little bit of this magic and gives players a chance to turn their iPhone or iPad into a retro gaming experience.</p><p> Two of the games in Ollie&#39;s Arcade — Ollie Soars and Tranquility Touchdown — were inspired by simple Easter eggs in <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2023/01/twitterrific-end-of-an-era/">Twitterrific</a> , our beloved Twitter app. We polished Tranquility Touchdown, completely revamped Ollie Soars, and added an all-new third game — our own take on the classic Snake. All of Ollie&#39;s mini-games are easy to learn and designed to be accessible for everyone. You can even play with your favorite game controller or via wireless keyboard.</p></blockquote><p> Ollie Soars is free of charge; the other two games are just $2 each. What a novel idea: pay once, play them forever. Tranquility Touchdown gets so many little details from the vector graphics arcade era right.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Ollie’s Arcade’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/ollies-arcade">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> The Talk Show: &#39;Pleading the Fifth&#39; </title><link href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/08/31/ep-384" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0w" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/the-talk-show-384" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40208</id><published> 2023-09-03T22:53:40Z</published><updated> 2023-09-03T22:53:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-thunderbolt-cable/">Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors</a> :</p><blockquote><p> Apple may offer a USB-C data transfer accessory cable for iPhone 15 Pro models that is capable of Thunderbolt or USB4 speeds of up to 40Gbps. That is <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1694893349705240598">the latest claim made by Kosutami</a> , who posted details of the cable on Twitter (now X). According to the leaker, the length of the cable is 0.8 meters, which is shorter than <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN713AM/A/thunderbolt-4-pro-cable-18-m">Apple&#39;s existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a> (1.8m), and it is said to support charging up to 150W. Apple will allegedly sell the cable separately.</p></blockquote><p> Lest you think it nickel-and-dime-y for Apple to sell a Thunderbolt 4 cable separately, note that Thunderbolt 4 cables are <em>expensive</em> . <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/thunderbolt-cable">Apple currently sells two</a> : the 1.8m one costs $129, and the 3m one costs $159. I bought a 0.8m one made by Razor last year, with very similar feel and quality to Apple&#39;s, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TGBF6DK/?tag=df-amzn-20">that Amazon currently sells for $46</a> . (That&#39;s a make-me-rich affiliate link, if you&#39;re in the market for a Thunderbolt 4 cable.) A 1m Thunderbolt cable from Monoprice (rubber, not braided) <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=44117">costs $30</a> . Apple&#39;s own 0.8m Thunderbolt 3 cable costs $39. I&#39;m guessing this new 0.8m Thunderbolt 4 cable from Apple will cost $99. It&#39;d be downright silly for Apple to include an expensive (and thick, stiff, and short) cable like that with every iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p> The reason to even offer such a cable, and to offer Thunderbolt 4 performance on the phones, is for data transfer, specifically video. The single biggest frustration regarding iPhones sticking with Lightning until this year is that 4K video files are <em>very</em> large, but USB 2.0 data transfer is <em>very</em> slow. iPhones have been capable of shooting 4K video since the 6S models in 2015, and as their image quality has improved each year, the data transfer limitations of Lightning has seemed more and more incongruous. <sup id="fnr1-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn1-2023-08-29">1</a></sup></p><p> I ran into this twice, when we used iPhones to shoot the COVID-era episodes of The Talk Show Remote From WWDC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg9F1Qjv3iU&amp;t=6s">in 2020</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SzbucgATjA">and 2021</a> . The footage looked great, but it took hours to transfer it off the phones. Heretofore, iPhones have offered pro-quality video cameras limited to decidedly consumer-level data transfer rates.</p><p> Speaking of “pro”, though, faster data transfer speeds might literally be capital-P Pro features this year. Hardwick continues:</p><blockquote><p> Speculation therefore remains rife about the USB-C port capabilities of the iPhone 15 lineup, and nothing is certain beyond the switch from Lightning. Rumors suggest the cables supplied in iPhone 15 boxes are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-usb-c-cable-usb2-transfer-speeds/">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> at a rate of 480 MBps, which is the same as Lightning.</p><p> In contrast, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to be supplied with cables capable of USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 transfer speeds, as per Kuo&#39;s original claim. Images from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/some-iphone-15-models-feature-thunderbolt-speeds/">ChargerLab</a> suggest that some iPhone 15 models will include a Thunderbolt/USB 4 retimer chip, seemingly confirming the rumor of higher-speed data transfer for the Pro models.</p><p> Each iPhone 15 will include a braided USB-C charging cable in the box that is thicker (ie more durable) and 50% longer than the Lightning cable that comes with current iPhone models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-braided-usb-c-cable-could-be-longer/">according to reports</a> . The cables are also rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">color-matched</a> to possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/five-iphone-15-color-options-to-expect/">new iPhone colors</a> , coming in at least black, white, yellow, blue, and orange.</p></blockquote><p> Even most Pro-model iPhone buyers never transfer data over a cable, so differentiating the iPhone 15 Pro models from the non-pro ones in this way feels fair. Including color-matched braided cables with all new models would be a nice touch (and lines up with other recent products, like the M1 iMacs and M2 MacBook Airs, that ship with color-matched braided cables). But the fact that some of these phones (the non-pro ones) might support only USB 2 speeds (480 Mbps), while others (the Pro models) will support up to Thunderbolt 4 (40 Gbps — roughly 80× faster), yet all the ports and cable connectors will look the same to the naked eye, only goes to show just how confusing “USB-C” is. Glenn Fleishman&#39;s headline from 2021 remains as apt as ever: “ <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/12/03/usbefuddled-untangling-the-rats-nest-of-usb-c-standards-and-cables/">USBefuddled: Untangling the Rat&#39;s Nest of USB-C Standards and Cables</a> ”.</p><hr /><p> While I&#39;m writing about the switch to USB-C, let me make a prediction how this will be received when it&#39;s officially announced in two weeks. The small number of filmmakers who shoot using iPhones (small compared to the aggregate number of iPhone users overall) will rejoice. The larger number of nerds, and even semi-nerds, who travel with multiple computing devices and just want USB-C charging connectors on all them will be happy. But the vast silent majority of normal iPhone users? I think there&#39;s going to be a backlash that most USB-C proponents don&#39;t see coming, premised on accusations that this switch is a money grab from Apple to get people to replace all their Lightning cables with new <a href="https://www.apple.com/us/search/usb-c-cable?src=globalnav">$30 USB-C cables from the Apple Store</a> .</p><p> <em>You</em> , dear reader, of course know that USB-C is an industry standard and you can buy <a href="https://www.anker.com/collections/usb-c?ref=naviMenu">high-quality cables</a> from <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/category/cables/usb-&amp;-lightning-cables/usb-c-cables">stores</a> other than Apple. I don&#39;t think everyone knows that. And even those who will buy their new USB-C charging cables from companies other than Apple are likely to grouse about the need to buy new cables at all.</p><p> When Apple switched from the 30-pin iPod connector to Lightning with the iPhone 5 in 2012, there was a <em>lot</em> of grousing. And that was a port switch where you could easily <em>see</em> how much better the new one was. (The old 30-pin connector and port really do look absurd to modern eyes.) At a glance USB-C doesn&#39;t look any better than and barely different from Lightning. My gut feeling is that not much has changed since 2012 on the “new iPhone connector” front, other than the fact that there are, quite literally, over a billion more iPhone users today than then, and thus perhaps <em>billions</em> of extant Lightning cables in use. Typical users put more value on being able to just keep using the old cables (and chargers) they already have <sup id="fnr2-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn2-2023-08-29">2</a></sup> — at their bedsides, in their kitchens, on their desks, in their cars, in their backpacks and purses — than reducing the number of different <em>types</em> of cables they need in their lives.</p><p> I don&#39;t know how many people are going to be irritated, if not downright angry, about this switch, but it&#39;s going to be a <em>lot</em> more people <sup id="fnr3-2023-08-29"><a href="#fn3-2023-08-29">3</a></sup> than most “ <em>the iPhone should have already switched to USB-C</em> ” proponents expect. Me, I&#39;ll gladly take the vastly-improved data transfer speeds. But I won&#39;t be the one answering the phone at 1-800-MY-APPLE.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1-2023-08-29"><p> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2391101/what-it-was-like-filming-unsane-on-an-iphone-according-to-the-cast">Steven Soderbergh shot the feature film <em>Unsane</em> using iPhone 7&#39;s in 2017</a> .

I think they wanted to introduce MagSafe first, let people accumulate a few MagSafe cables in the places where they charge their iPhones, and then switch from Lightning to USB-C. Three years of iPhones (12, 13, 14) have already had MagSafe, so that&#39;s about an average upgrade cycle for most users.

<p>Apple&#39;s Developer News site has a nice interview with three indie developers who&#39;ve visited the Vision Pro labs, including Michael Simmons from <a href="https://flexibits.com/">Flexibits</a> and David “Underscore” Smith, of <a href="https://www.david-smith.org/apps/">Widgetsmith</a> fame:</p><blockquote><p> For his part, Simmons saw Fantastical work right out of the box. He describes the labs as “a proving ground” for future explorations and a chance to push software beyond its current bounds. “A bordered screen can be limiting. Sure, you can scroll, or have multiple monitors, but generally speaking, you&#39;re limited to the edges,” he says. “Experiencing spatial computing not only validated the designs we&#39;d been thinking about — it helped us start thinking not just about left to right or up and down, but beyond borders at all.”</p></blockquote><p> Simmons&#39;s remarks echo my biggest takeaway from my demo experience: the lack of a “frame” encompassing windows.</p><blockquote><p> And as not just CEO but the lead product designer (and the guy who “still comes up with all these crazy ideas”), he came away from the labs with a fresh batch of spatial thoughts. “Can people look at a whole week spatially? Can people compare their current day to the following week? If a day is less busy, can people make that day wider? And then, what if like you have the whole week wrap around you in 360 degrees?”他说。 “I could probably — not kidding — talk for two hours about this.”</p></blockquote><p> Two hours, you say? <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/04/30/ep-345">I know a guy</a> .</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Inside the Apple Vision Pro Developer Labs’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/inside-vision-developer-labs">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface </title><link href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0o" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40200</id><published> 2023-08-28T18:45:16Z</published><updated> 2023-08-29T21:58:22Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Remember <em>last</em> year at WWDC, when Apple previewed the next generation of CarPlay, with support for screens that span the entire dashboard? Here&#39;s a MotorTrend report on the 2024 Porsche Cayenne SUV. <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-porsche-cayenne-suv-infotainment-preview-apple-carplay?slide=2">Slide 2</a> shows a CarPlay interface that I had first wrongly presumed spans the entire dashboard, but in fact does not.</p><p> <strong>Update 1:</strong> A few readers have chimed in to suggest this is <em>not</em> next-gen CarPlay 2, it&#39;s just extended use of CarPlay 1. It&#39;s definitely improved, but it is not the new stuff Apple previewed last June. My question: If this is <em>not</em> CarPlay 2, when, if ever, will we actually see a carmaker announce CarPlay 2 support? ( <em>Voice from the cheap seats: “When Apple makes their own car.”</em> )</p><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/28/hands-on-porsche-new-carplay-app/">Here&#39;s a hands-on report by Jameson Dow</a> for 9to5Mac from last month:</p><blockquote><p> We got a chance to test out some of its features on a 2024 Cayenne, and it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve felt an Apple-like experience from software made by a traditional automaker.</p><p> We&#39;re still waiting for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/03/new-carplay-interface-features-release/">next-gen CarPlay experience</a> which Apple announced last year, which promises greater integration with vehicle functions than today&#39;s version of CarPlay. In the meantime, though, Porsche has taken it upon itself to build its own app which offers the best of both worlds — a snappy, CarPlay-like user interface, along with control of some vehicle functions which were heretofore unavailable through Apple&#39;s software.</p></blockquote><p> So it might be the best CarPlay interface yet to ship in a car, but it&#39;s <em>not</em> the next-gen CarPlay announced by Apple last year. It&#39;s just CarPlay in the middle with other displays showing built-in stuff from Porsche based on <a href="https://www.porscheirvine.com/research/porsche-communication-management.htm">PCM</a> , their own in-house software platform.</p><p> <strong>Update 3:</strong> I&#39;ve now received feedback from three different readers who&#39;ve all said more or less the same thing: they paid extra for these extra screens in their Cayennes or Taycans, and the software experience on them is terrible. They regret paying for it. “A wasted useless screen” said one.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Porsche Previews New CarPlay Interface’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/porsche-carplay">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Kolide </title><link href="https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0n" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/28/kolide" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40199</id><published> 2023-08-28T17:28:39Z</published><updated> 2023-08-28T17:28:40Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it&#39;s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn&#39;t play out like that. Users <em>don&#39;t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won&#39;t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p><p> With Kolide, when a user&#39;s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.

<p>Clay Risen, reporting for The New York Times:</p><blockquote><p> John Warnock, a founder of Adobe Systems whose innovations in computer graphics, including the ubiquitous PDF, made possible today&#39;s visually rich digital experiences, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 82.</p><p> The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started in 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.</p></blockquote><p> It was just a month ago that pancreatic cancer took Kevin Mitnick, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/kevin-mitnick-rip">I remarked</a> on how many people this specific cancer has taken of late.</p><blockquote><p> Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an arduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on either a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or a specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $10,000 and take up most of a room.</p><p> Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop printers themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer sent them. Adobe&#39;s first such protocol, PostScript, went into Apple&#39;s revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a few years it was the industry standard.</p><p> PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware companies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely unknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a program designed to render and read files in what it called a Portable Document Format, or PDF.</p></blockquote><p> PDF was an enormous breakthrough, and is more relevant today than ever. A true document format for the ages. But Adobe was well on its way before 1993. <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/02/20/a-blast-from-the-past-demos-of-adobe-photoshop-1-0/">Photoshop 1.0 launched in early 1990</a> . They began shipping their library of original <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5141">PostScript fonts and the essential Adobe Type Manager software</a> in 1989. And Illustrator 1.0 launched back in 1987, shipping with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjPTMfVBDh0">this video tour demonstrated by Warnock himself</a> .</p><p> Warnock and Geschke understood what Steve Jobs often preached: technology alone was not enough. PostScript was — <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html">and remains</a> ! — excellent technology. But it was not a product. The LaserWriter was a product. You hooked it up, went to File → Print in <em>any</em> application, and you got professional-grade 300 DPI output with no technical expertise necessary. It was as easy to print high-quality output on a LaserWriter as it was to print junk output on a slow, noisy dot-matrix printer. <em>That</em> was a product.</p><p> And Illustrator turned PostScript from a rather difficult but highly-capable programming language into a tool designed for use by artists. They didn&#39;t just make a nice code editor for writing PostScript. They created an app that presented a visual framework in which you directly manipulated shapes, lines, and curves as objects. Even expert Illustrator users were never exposed to PostScript directly. The Illustrator metaphor was a complete <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/eps-file.html">encapsulation</a> . That too was a product, and Illustrator remains an essential tool. If Warnock and Geschke had been satisfied merely with shipping great technology alone, Adobe Systems would be a nearly forgotten Silicon Valley footnote. Instead, they pushed to make Adobe the great tool-making product company we know today.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Adobe Co-Founder John Warnock Dies at 82’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/26/john-warnock-rip">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> Threads Web App Launches </title><link href="https://www.threads.net/@threads/post/CwVVlQlOe53" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0k" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/threads-web" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40196</id><published> 2023-08-25T23:16:06Z</published><updated> 2023-08-26T19:25:24Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[

The web app (again, just like with Instagram) looks and feels very much like a native app would.</p><p> MacOS 14 Sonoma — currently in public beta, set for release this fall — <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/how-web-apps-work-macos-sonoma/">adds built-in support for saving web apps as standalone apps</a> , like the “Add to Home Screen” feature that&#39;s been in iOS since even before the App Store. I&#39;m not running Sonoma yet, but those who are report being pleased with Threads as a web app. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@parkerortolani/post/CwVRjUAOUB_">Parker Ortolani has a nice tip</a> for making the icon look better, too.</p><div> <a  title="Permanent link to ‘Threads Web App Launches’"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/threads-web">★</a></div> ]]>;</content></entry><entry><title> &#39;Giving Up the iPad-Only Travel Dream&#39; </title><link href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/why-i-gave-up-on-the-ipad-only-dream/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0j" rel="shorturl" type="text/html"/><link href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/ipad-only-travel-dream" rel="related" type="text/html"/><id> tag:daringfireball.net,2023:/linked//6.40195</id><published> 2023-08-25T20:51:33Z</published><updated> 2023-08-27T20:38:16Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/ </uri></author><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p><blockquote><p> In the battle between iPad and Mac, I&#39;m a longtime member of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2016/02/ipad-vs-mac-im-on-team-both/">Team Both</a> — I use my Mac most of the day at my desk, but when I write elsewhere in the house or backyard, I switch to an iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard case. And that iPad (in a regular case) is my primary computing device when I&#39;m not in work mode.</p><p> I&#39;m not at all ready to declare the “use iPad to get work done” experiment dead. With the forthcoming release of iPadOS 17, Stage Manager has thrown in a bunch of improvements that suggest the iPad&#39;s progression to more functional status continues, albeit at a pace that&#39;s a bit too slow for my liking.</p><p> But here I sit at my mother&#39;s dining room table, typing on a MacBook Air.我的旅行方式发生了一些变化，我试图了解它是什么，以及它告诉我关于 iPad 作为生产力工具的发展轨迹。</p></blockquote><p>我曾多次<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air">详细地</a>写过我对 iPad 的复杂感受——其中最尖锐的是 2020 年 1 月的一篇题为“ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10">iPad 尴尬地迎来 10 周年</a>”的文章。 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/stage+manager">Stage Manager</a>是自我撰写本文以来 iPad 界面最大的变化，它的存在无疑对“高级用户”方面有所帮助。 （Stage Manager 在今年的 iPadOS 17 中看到了一些<a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/with-ipados-17-stage-manager-is-finally-moving-in-the-right-direction/">不错的改进</a>。）但就我个人而言，我仍然发现，当我在 Mac 前度过工作时间时，我的工作效率最高。很多人都使用 iPad 进行写作和其他创造性活动。但我知道，就工作效率而言，我的最佳选择是使用 iPad 基本上作为单任务消费设备来进行长篇阅读和视频观看。</p><p>这个话题之所以长盛不衰，是因为我<em>想</em>更多地使用我的 iPad。有一种说不出来的感觉。当我使用 iPad 做一些 iPad 最擅长的事情时，我感到很兴奋。老实说，我认为如果我根本没有 iPad，我的工作效率会更高，但我一直在努力寻找更多地使用它的方法。</p><p>因此，当我旅行时，是否携带 MacBook Pro 从来都不是问题。即使我没有计划或不想在一次特定的旅行中工作，《大胆火球》的单人表演性质也意味着我觉得我需要能够这样做。 （ <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned">12 年前的昨天，当这个消息传出</a>时，我正在全家度假，准备去吃晚饭。）问题是，我是否会带上我的 iPad Pro，或者只是单独使用 iPhone 和 Mac。当我收拾行李时，我通常会把 iPad 扔进包里，心想如果不这样做我就会想念它。但当我把 iPad 留在家里时，我不会想念它。不过，这很令人困惑，因为我下周要去旅行，我打赌我会带上我那该死的 iPad。</p><div> <a  title="永久链接“放弃仅使用 iPad 的旅行梦想”"  href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/25/ipad-only-travel-dream">★</a></div> ]]>; </content></entry><entry><link href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/kouvakas_uk_surveillance" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><link href="http://df4.us/v0f" rel="shorturl"/><id>标签：daringfireball.net,2023://1.40191</id><published> 2023-08-24T01:20:01Z</published><updated> 2023-08-24T01:20:02Z</updated><author><name> John Gruber</name><uri> http://daringfireball.net/</uri></author><summary type="text">我相信，实际发生的情况是，像 WhatsApp（在英国极其流行）、Signal 和 iMessage 这样的 E2EE 消息平台*将停止工作，并从英国的应用商店下架*，完全停止。英国似乎认为这是虚张声势；我不。 </summary><content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/87615/changes-to-uk-surveillance-regime-may-violate-international-law/">Ioannis Kouvakas，Just Security 撰文</a>：</p><blockquote><p>虽然该提案没有具体说明需要通知哪些技术变化，但这些变化可能包括会<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revised-investigatory-powers-act-notices-regimes-consultation/consultation-on-revised-notices-regimes-in-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016-accessible-version#proposed-changes">干扰</a>英国当前监控权力的软件架构的变化。因此，希望引入高级安全功能的消息服务运营商现在必须首先提前告知内政部。设备制造商可能还必须在提供修复已知漏洞并<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/managing-deployed-devices/keeping-devices-and-software-up-to-date">保证设备安全</a>的重要<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66256081">安全更新</a>之前通知政府。因此，国务卿在收到此类预先通知后，现在可以要求运营商放弃修补安全漏洞，以允许政府出于监视目的保持访问权限。</p></blockquote><p>这正是我几个月来一直认为英国正在制定这项立法的方向，但看到它如此赤裸裸地描述仍然令人震惊。这就像看着有人开车驶向悬崖，并警告人们，“<em>嘿，我认为这些人正在驶向悬崖</em>”——但看到他们驶下悬崖时我仍然感到惊讶。</p><p> E2EE 可以像电灯开关一样切换并且仍然允许传递消息，这完全是一个幻想。端到端加密不是糖衣，不是某种额外的保护层——它是消息传递协议本身的基础。当你想到这一点时，它一定是这样的。如果 Signal 可以默默地禁用 E2EE 但仍然有消息通过，那么用户如何信任该服务呢？您既不能相信您发送的内容会安全传送，也不能相信您收到的内容不会被闯入者拦截。所有这些 E2EE 消息传递平台都明确保证<a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">消息<em>只能</em>安全地通过</a>。删除 E2EE 不需要对协议进行一些简单的调整，而是需要完全替换协议（使用本质上不安全的协议）。</p><p>对于世界上每个用户的安全更新都需要英国内政部的批准，只是为了确保补丁不会关闭政府本身正在利用的漏洞，这一想法令人难以置信。即使英国是世界上唯一通过这样一项法律的国家，那也将是疯狂的，但当其他国家效仿时会发生什么呢？</p><p>在我看来，最有可能的结果是英国通过了这项法律，<em>认为</em>消息服务向他们传达的严重关切被夸大了。平台提供商表示他们<em>无法</em>遵守，但实际上他们只是<em>不想</em>遵守，因为这只是困难，而不是不可能。当它成为法律时，平台会将其交给书呆子，书呆子会更努力地书呆子，然后繁荣，平台将遵守这项法律。这就是他们<em>认为</em>会发生的事情。我相信，实际发生的情况是，WhatsApp（在英国极其流行）、Signal 和 iMessage 等 E2EE 消息平台<em>将停止运行，并从英国的应用商店下架</em>，完全停止。英国似乎认为这是虚张声势；我不。</p><p>库瓦卡斯提出的关于这些变化将违反国际法的论点或许会以迄今为止技术论点尚未引起的方式引起英国的共鸣。</p> ]]>;</content><title> ★ “英国监控制度的改变可能违反国际法”</title></entry></feed><!-- THE END -->
